      For 35 months, we monitored hantavirus activity in rodent populations in central Arizona. The most frequently captured hantavirus antibody-positive rodents were Peromyscus boylii and P. truei. Antibody-positive P. boylii were more frequently male (84%), older, and heavier, and they survived longer on trapping web sites than antibody-negative mice. The number of antibody-positive P. boylii was greater during high population densities than during low densities, while antibody prevalence was greater during low population densities. Virus transmission and incidence rates, also related to population densities, varied by trapping site. The spatial distribution of antibody-positive P. boylii varied by population density and reflected the species preference for dense chaparral habitats. The focal ranges of antibody-positive P. boylii also demonstrated a patchy distribution of hantavirus.

      Group A rotaviruses infect and cause diarrhea in humans and a wide range of mammals. Previous studies have suggested that some strains can cross the species barrier to infect humans (Martella et al., 2010). However, there are few reports on infection and characterization of rotaviruses in wild animals. To estimate what types of rotaviruses infect wild animals, we investigated infection of rotaviruses in wild animals living in urban areas in Japan between 2003 and 2008. Of 145 fecal specimens obtained, we detected rotaviruses in one sample from a Japanese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) (RAC-DG5) and in one sample from a masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) (MP-CIVET66) by RT-semi-nested PCR. Sequence analyses of the VP4 and VP7 genes of RAC-DG5 and MP-CIVET66 strains revealed that these strains belong to G3bP[9] genotype. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses showed that RAC-DG5 and MP-CIVET66 strains were closely related to human and feline rotaviruses, suggesting interspecies transmission from humans or cats. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection and characterization of rotaviruses in a Japanese raccoon dog and masked palm civet. These findings show that wild animals constitute a potential zoonotic risk of rotaviruses.

      The ability of a New World (NW) clade B arenavirus to enter cells using human transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) strictly correlates with its ability to cause hemorrhagic fever. Amapari (AMAV) and Tacaribe (TCRV), two nonpathogenic NW clade B arenaviruses that do not use human TfR1, are closely related to the NW arenaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers. Here we show that pseudotyped viruses bearing the surface glycoprotein (GP) of AMAV or TCRV can infect cells using the TfR1 orthologs of several mammalian species, including those of their respective natural hosts, the small rodent Neacomys spinosus and the fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis. Mutation of one residue in human TfR1 makes it a functional receptor for TCRV, and mutation of four residues makes it a functional receptor for AMAV. Our data support an in vivo role for TfR1 in the replication of most, if not all, NW clade B arenaviruses, and suggest that with modest changes in their GPs the nonpathogenic arenaviruses could use human TfR1 and emerge as human pathogens.

      The prevalence of different genotypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Ethiopia is not known. HCV genotypes influence the response to therapy with alpha-interferon alone or in combination with ribavirin. A cross sectional study was conducted on attendees of voluntary counseling and testing center. Serum samples from 1,954 (734 HIV positive and 1,220 HIV negative) individuals were screened for HCV antibody. Active HCV infection was confirmed by quantitative PCR in 18 of the 71 samples with anti-HCV antibodies. The HCV viral load ranged from 39,650 to 9,878,341 IU/ml (median 1,589,631 IU/ml) with no significant difference [χ(2)(17) = 18.00, P = 0.389] between persons positive or negative for HIV. The viral load of HCV was, however, higher in older study subjects (r = 0.80, P = 0.000). HCV genotypes were determined using the VERSANT HCV Genotype Assay (LiPA) and sequence analysis of the NS5b region of the HCV genome. Diverse HCV genotypes were found including genotypes 1, 2, 4, and 5. There was no difference in the distribution regarding the HIV status. As in other parts of the world, genotyping of HCV must be considered whenever HCV is incriminated as a cause of hepatitis.

      An outbreak resulting in mortality in Sindh Ibex (Capra aegagrus blythi) was investigated. There was a history of about 36 deaths (both young and adult) during the period of 1 month. Disease appeared in a generalized form, affecting the respiratory and digestive systems. Major lesions were respiratory distress, pustules on and in the mouth, ocular-nasal discharges, and severe diarrhea. The most significant lesion was the oculonasal discharges and diarrhea. Deaths were mainly due to blindness, anorexia, diarrhea, and respiratory arrest. Both adult (mortality = 21) and young (mortality = 15) animals were affected with the disease. Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) antigen was detected in the spleen, lung, lymph node, and swab samples by immunocapture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spleen and lung samples were also tested and found positive for the presence of F-gene of PPRV by polymerase chain reaction. Thirteen of 20 serum samples from nearby sheep and goats were found positive for antibodies to PPRV. The disease threatened the huge population of ibex in the wild life park, which was spread over a large area, but vaccination of the domestic population of sheep and goats in the surrounding villages appeared to control the disease.

      Between 2005 and 2006, clinical specimens were collected from 31 infants with suspected congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) who presented at six hospitals in Khartoum, Sudan. Eleven (35.5%) were laboratory confirmed as CRS cases by testing for anti-rubella IgM, IgG and viral genome. For the first time in Sudan, the rubella virus genome was directly detected in clinical specimens of six CRS cases and two viruses were isolated in cell culture. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that three genotypes of rubella virus (RV; 1E, 2B and 1G) were co-circulating in Sudan. The study introduced the methodology for CRS confirmation and surveillance in Sudan and provides preliminary data.

      Infection with hepatitis G virus (HGV) or GB virus-C (GBV-C) is widely distributed in human populations. Viruses related to GBV-C/HGV have been recovered from several New World primate species, including tamarins, owl monkeys and marmosets. To understand more about the relationship between GB viruses and their hosts, we used primers from the 5' non-coding (5'NC), non-structural 3 (NS3) and NS5 regions in nested polymerase chain reactions to screen for related viruses infecting non-captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes, troglodytes and verus subspecies). Sequences from the 5'NCR and NS5 regions were amplified from samples taken from 3 of 39 chimpanzees, and from one chimpanzee in the NS3 region. Sequence comparisons of each region revealed that the GB virus infecting chimpanzees was distinct from both GBV-C/HGV and from any of the known GBV-A sequences, but was more closely related to human viruses. GB viruses recovered from different chimpanzees were more diverse than variants of GBV-C/HGV found in humans, with 25% sequence divergence in the 5'NCR and 20% (9.5% amino acid) sequence divergence in NS5 between variants recovered from the troglodytes and verus subspecies, compared with 7.4% and 10.4% (1.9% amino acid) divergence amongst GBV-C/HGV variants infecting humans. Finding GBV-C/HGV-related viruses in an Old World monkey species suggests that GB-like viruses may be widely distributed in simians, and suggests a close evolutionary relationship with their natural hosts.

      A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (C-ELISA), using a group-specific monoclonal antibody against bluetongue virus (BTV), was applied to detect anti-BTV antibodies in serum samples from two llamas (Llama glama) experimentally infected with BTV serotype 10. Antibodies were detected in both llamas by 1 wk or 2 wk post-infection. Antibodies to BTV increased exponentially during the first 4 wk in both llamas and stabilized at an elevated level during the remaining 5-wk-period of the experiment. We evaluated the C-ELISA for 1,442 field sera from bluetongue-free areas, collected from 398 llamas in New Zealand as well as 451 elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis), 323 bison (Bison bison) and 270 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Canada. Based on the frequency distribution of the C-ELISA values, we propose that the current negative cut-off value of 50% inhibition established for bovine field sera also can be applied to the sera from these wild ruminants. The C-ELISA values for other wild ruminant field sera collected in bluetongue-free areas of Canada from 98 native caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), 32 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), 14 moose (Alces alces), and nine musk-oxen (Ovibos maschatus) and 15 yak (Bos grunniens) also were less than 50%, with the exception of three caribou samples. Based on our results, we propose that the C-ELISA be used as a rapid and specific test for serodiagnosis of BTV infection in llamas and possibly other wild ruminants.

      Individuals belonging to five families, 12 genera, and 19 different species of bats from dengue endemic areas in the Gulf and Pacific coasts of Mexico were examined by ELISA, RT-PCR, and for the presence of dengue virus (DV) NS1 protein. Nine individuals from four species were seropositive by ELISA: three insectivorous, Myotis nigricans (four positives/12 examined), Pteronotus parnellii (3/19), and Natalus stramineus (1/4), and one frugivorous Artibeus jamaicensis (1/35) (12.86% seroprevalence in positive species). DV serotype 2 was detected by RT-PCR in four samples from three species (all from the Gulf coast - rainy season): two frugivorous, A. jamaicensis (2/9), and Carollia brevicauda (1/2), and one insectivorous, M. nigricans (1/11). The latter was simultaneously positive for NS1 protein. DV RT-PCR positive animals were all antibody seronegative. M. nigricans showed positive individuals for all three tests. This is the first evidence suggesting the presence of DV in bats from Mexico.

      During 1988 and 1989, a serologic survey of wildlife was conducted in northeastern Mexico to determine the presence, prevalence, and distribution of arboviruses and other selected disease agents. Eighty mammal specimens were tested. Antibodies to vesicular stomatitis-Indiana, Venezuelan equine encephalitis-Mena II, Rio Grande virus, and vesicular stomatitis-New Jersey were detected predominantly in small mammals. Deer and mouflon (Ovis musimon) had antibodies to bluetongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. Two species had serologic evidence of recent exposure to Francisella tularensis. A white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) had antibodies to Anaplasma marginale. All specimens tested for antibodies against Yersinia pestis and Brucella abortus were negative. Sera from 315 birds were tested for antibody against five equine encephalitis viruses and six avian pathogens. During 1988, antibodies to Venezuelan equine encephalitis-Mena II, Venezuelan equine encephalitis-TC83, St. Louis encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, and western equine encephalitis were detected in birds of several species. Antibodies to Pasteurella multocida and Newcastle disease virus were also detected. Birds from five species presented antibodies to Mycoplasma meleagridis. Specimens tested for M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and Chlamydia psittaci were negative. To the best of our knowledge, this survey represents the first serologic evidence of bluetongue, Cache Valley virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease, Jamestown Canyon virus, vesicular stomatitis-Indiana, vesicular stomatitis-New Jersey, Rio Grande virus, and tularemia reported among wildlife in Mexico.

      Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis in many developing countries. This study describes an outbreak of HEV infection in Al-Sadr city, Baghdad. Blood samples obtained from patients with jaundice attending 19 primary health care centres in AI-Sadr city during a 6-month period in 2005 were tested for HEV. HEV (IgM) antibodies were detected in 38.1% of 268 patients. The association of HEV infection with unacceptable residual chlorine concentrations and/or bacteriologically unsafe water samples was significant. High rates of HEV infection, low chlorine concentrations and unsafe water were reported in June. Gross isruption of sanitation and water supplies was the most likely contributing factor.

      Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a vector-borne disease of ruminants disseminated in the tropic and subtropic zone of the world. Gazella subgutturosa subgutturosa (goitered gazelle) is native species of Anatolia. Due to risk of extinction, captured gazelles have been taken under protection in a restricted area at Ceylanpinar state farm. In this study, the presence of EHDV was investigated serologically in 82 goitered gazelle and 399 cattle. Seropositivity rates in goitered gazelle and cattle were detected as 2.43% and 3.50%, respectively.

      Serum samples from 76 free-ranging adult jackals of three species from four localities in Kenya were examined for circulating antibodies against four canine pathogens: rabies virus, canine parvovirus (CPV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV), and Ehrlichia canis. Samples were collected between April 1987 and January 1988. Among black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas), the most sampled species, the mean prevalence of antibodies to CPV-2, CDV, rabies virus, and E. canis was 34% (14 positive/55 sampled), 9% (4/55), 3% (1/28), and 2% (1/36), respectively. There were no significantly differences among sampling locations. In one area, antibody prevalence of CPV-2 was significantly higher for golden jackals (C. aureus; 9/16) than for C. mesomelas (5/26). Only three side-striped jackals (C. adustus) were sampled, but antibodies to CPV-2 and CDV were present. As jackals often are the most abundant wild carnivore in African ecosystems, they could serve as an important indicator species to monitor the potential of exposure of rare and endangered canids to specific canine diseases.

      African horse sickness (AHS) is a disease that affects equids, and is principally transmitted by Culicoides spp. that are biological vectors of AHS viruses (AHSV). The repeated spread of AHSV from sub-Saharan Africa to the Middle East, northern Africa and the Iberian peninsula indicate that a better understanding of AHS epizootiology is needed. African horse sickness has long been known to infect and cause mortality among domestic dogs that ingest virus contaminated meat, but it is uncertain what role carnivores play in transmission of the virus. We present evidence of widespread natural AHS infection among a diversity of African carnivore species. We hypothesize that such infection resulted from ingestion of meat and organs from AHS-infected prey species. The effect of AHS on the carnivores is unknown, as is their role in the maintenance cycle of the disease.

      Bluetongue is an International Office of Epizootics List A disease described as the century's most economically devastating affliction of sheep. Bluetongue (BLU) viruses were thought to infect only ruminants, shrews, and some rodents, but recently, inadvertent administration of BLU virus-contaminated vaccine resulted in mortality and abortion among domestic dogs. We present evidence of natural BLU virus infection among African carnivores that dramatically widens the spectrum of susceptible hosts. We hypothesize that such infection occurred after ingestion of meat and organs from BLU virus-infected prey species. The effect of BLU virus on endangered carnivores such as the cheetah and African wild dog requires urgent investigation. Also, the role of carnivores in the epizootiology of this disease needs elucidation.

      On the 25th of July 2007, bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 1 was detected in Andalusia, southern Spain for the first time. A total of 4436 farms infected with BTV-1 were confirmed during that year: 3162 in sheep flocks, 113 in goat flocks, 7 in cattle herds and 1154 in mixed farms (sheep, goat and/or cattle in the same farm). The most common clinical signs were: fever, depression, lethargy, facial edema, and salivation (observed in more than 70% of the infected farms). Lesions in oral mucosa, lameness and dyspnea were also frequently observed. Median morbidity rate in sheep and goat flocks were 6.3% and 2.7% respectively. Median mortality rate was 2.2% in sheep flocks and 1.2% in goat flocks. Median case fatality rate was 29.8% in sheep flocks and 45% in goat flocks. Morbidity and mortality rates were not significantly higher in sheep flocks than in goat flocks (p>0.05), whereas case fatality rate was significant higher in goat flocks compared to sheep flocks (p<0.05). Neither clinical signs nor mortality were observed in cattle herds. The spatial distribution of the risk of BTV infection over Andalusia by municipality was evaluated by means of a hierarchical Bayesian model. The results evidenced that the risk was not homogeneous over the territory, being higher in the western part of the region. The likelihood of BTV infection was increased between 1.01 and 1.16 times by an increase of 10,000 domestic ruminants, and between 1.01 and 1.69 times by the presence of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the municipality.

      Two isolates of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus (ZRC 276RA/90 and ZRC 292RA/90) were isolated from two dormice (Myoxus glis) in Tuscany, Italy. The two isolates were lethal for laboratory mice and caused a rapid cytopathic effect characterized by rounded and wrinkled cells in both baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) and African green monkey kidney cells (Vero). We found neutralizing antibodies against EMC virus in 408 (77%) of 529 domestic pigs (Sus scrofa scrofa) and in 165 (49%) of 338 wild boars (S. scrofa ferus majori) in Tuscany.

      The prevalence of antibody to the viruses of bovine virus diarrhoea (BVD), bovine herpes virus typel (BHV1), rift valley fever (RVF), bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) and bluetongue (BT) and to Leptospira sp. was determined in wildlife populations in Zimbabwe. Evidence of infection with BVD virus was found in 14 of the 16 species examined but was greatest in eland Taurotragus oryx, nyala Tragelaphus angasi and bushbuck Tragelaphus scriptus. Persistent infection with BVD virus was found in 1 of 303 antibody-free eland but not in the smaller sample of 102 antibody-free buffalo Syncerus caffer. Antibody to BHV1 was widespread, being found in 10 of 16 species with the highest prevalence being in buffalo and eland. Antibody to RVF was most prevalent in black rhino Diceros bicornis and white rhino Ceratotherium simum, buffalo and waterbuck Kobus ellipsiprymnus. Both BEF and BT were widespread in all the species examined. Evidence of infection with Leptospira sp. was found in 7 species. Infections were due to up to 3 of 8 different serovars.

      During 2 successive rainy seasons, January 2008 through May 2008 and November 2008 through March 2009, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) caused outbreaks in Madagascar. Human and animal infections were confirmed on the northern and southern coasts and in the central highlands. Analysis of partial sequences from RVFV strains showed that all were similar to the strains circulating in Kenya during 2006-2007. A national cross-sectional serologic survey among slaughterhouse workers at high risk showed that RVFV circulation during the 2008 outbreaks included all of the Malagasy regions and that the virus has circulated in at least 92 of Madagascar's 111 districts. To better predict and respond to RVF outbreaks in Madagascar, further epidemiologic studies are needed, such as RVFV complete genome analysis, ruminant movement mapping, and surveillance implementation.

      Sera from healthy humans contained naturally occurring antibody against group- or subgroup-specific antigen on the envelope of the following type C viruses isolated from primates: gibbon ape leukemia virus, simian (woolly monkey) sarcoma virus, baboon endogenous type C virus, and putative human type C viruses [HL23V isolated from blood cells of a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (HL23) and HEL-12V from human embryonic diploid cells (CIH-32)]. Two sera also reacted with C57BL/6 mouse leukemia induced by Friend virus. These results were obtained by indirect immunoelectron microscopy with various virus-producing cells and by absorption tests using as targets gibbon lymphosarcoma cells that release gibbon ape leukemia virus. In a previous report, the presence of natural antibody in sera from healthy gibbon apes was demonstrated. When the specificities of the human and gibbon natural antibodies were compared, the human natural antibody reacted with two nonproducing culture cell lines of human lymphocytic leukemia (CEM-A and MOLT) and with human embryonic diploid (CIH-1(V-) cells [which became type C virus-producing CIH-32(V+) cells after many passages], but did not react with normal gibbon spleen monolayer cells. In contrast, gibbon natural antibody showed no reaction with CEM-A, MOLT, and CIH-1(V-) cells but reacted with gibbon spleen monolayer cells. Neither human nor gibbon natural antibody that was reactive with gibbon ape leukemia virus crossreacted with feline leukemia virus and mouse wild-type AKR leukemia virus. The gibbon lymphosarcoma cells releasing gibbon ape leukemia virus were used in a screening study of sera from healthy humans. Out of 72 sera screened by indirect immunoelectron microscopy using this system, 55 were positive (76%), i.e., 26 out of 35 males (74%) and 29 out of 37 females (78%). The highest incidence of antibody production was in 1- to 10-year-olds and 31- to 40-year-olds, with the adults exhibiting higher levels. Differences in incidence of natural antibody were not found to be sex-linked. These findings suggest that type C RNA viruses related to the gibbon ape leukemia virus and simian (woolly monkey) sarcoma virus family as well as the baboon endogenous type C virus family may be widespread in humans.

      A single-tube nested reverse transcriptase (nRT) polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR) was developed and evaluated for detection of palyam serogroup orbiviruses ribonucleic acid (RNA) in cell cultures and clinical samples. A pair of outer primers (pal1 and pal2), designed from genome segment three of Chuzan virus of the palyam viruses serogroup, resulted in amplification of a primary 660-base pair (bp) PCR product. Using a pair of internal (nested) primers (pal3 and pal4), the nRT-PCR produced a 350-bp PCR product. The primary and the nested PCR products were amplified from RNA extracted from Sudanese and South African isolates of palyam viruses, propagated in cell cultures. Application of this nRT-PCR to clinical samples resulted in direct detection of palyam virus RNA in blood and serum samples from infected cattle and goats. The nested amplification increased the sensitivity of the assay by 1000-fold, and specific PCR products were detected from as little as 0.1fg of viral RNA. Amplification products were not detected when the nRT-PCR was applied to RNA from closely related orbiviruses including, bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes 1, 2, 4, 6; epizootic hemorrhagic disease of deer virus prototype serotype 1 (EHDV-1); Sudanese isolates of EHDV-318; total nucleic acid extracts from non-infected Vero cells; and blood and sera from goats and calves from which virus was not isolated. This nRT-PCR provides a reliable, sensitive and specific assay for rapid detection and differentiation of palyam viruses from other related orbiviruses. In addition, the assay is recommended for inclusion in epidemiological surveys and during investigation of an epizootic of the disease among susceptible ruminants.

      An enzootic focus of rabies in skunks in Mexico is described. Fifty three wild animals including two badgers (Taxidea taxus), 32 bats (various species), one bobcat (Lynx rufus), two coatis (Nasua narica) three foxes (Urocyon cineroargenteus), one raccoon (Procyon lotor) and 12 skunks (see below) were tested for rabies by direct immunofluorescence assay from 1991 to 1997 in the central part of San Luis Potosi State, Mexico. Rabies occurrence was 21% of all tested mammals, with 19% in skunks and only 2% in other wild species (one bobcat). Skunks represented 23% of all mammals tested and had a rabies prevalence of 83%. Only 10 individuals were identified: three hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus leuconotus) and seven spotted skunks (Spilogale putorius). All were involved in human attacks; the spotted skunk attacks were inside bedrooms while people were sleeping, and the hog-nosed skunk attacks occurred outdoors. Skunk cases of rabies represented 40% of all rabies cases in 1997, and 100% of cases registered for wild animals in San Luis Potosi state. This situation constitutes an important public health problem and requires further epidemiological research to make the human population aware of the problem and to establish measures to limit further human attacks by rabid skunks.

      Prevalence of IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus (IgG-anti-HEV) was determined among different animal species from India. Seropositivity varied from 4.4% to 6.9% in cattle, 54.6-74.4% in pigs and 2.1-21.5% in rodents. Of the 44 dogs screened, 10 were positive (22.7%). None of the 250 goat sera tested were found to be anti-HEV positive. Among rodents, over 50% serum samples collected in 1985 from Bandicota bengalensis were positive for anti-HEV antibodies. No evidence of HEV infection was obtained following experimental inoculation of an Indian strain (AKL-90) of HEV into anti-HEV negative pigs and goats. The results document varied prevalence of anti-HEV antibodies in different animal species from India and of inability of Indian pigs and goats to support replication of at least one human strain of HEV.

      Current knowledge of the pathogenic hantavirus indicates that wild rodents are its primary natural reservoir. Specific primers to detect the presence of viral genomes were developed using an SYBR-Green-based real-time RT-PCR protocol. One hundred sixty-four rodents native to the Atlantic Forest biome were captured in São Paulo State, Brazil, and their tissues were tested. The presence of hantavirus RNA was detected in sixteen rodents: three specimens of Akodon montensis, three of Akodon cursor, two of Necromys lasiurus, one of Juliomys sp., one of Thaptomys nigrita, five of Oligoryzomys nigripes, and one of Oryzomys sp. This SYBR Green real-time RT-PCR method for detection of hantavirus may be useful for surveying hantaviruses in Brazil.

      Habitat fragmentation and diseases have resulted in a decline of the marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) throughout its South American range. Our objectives were to determine whether marsh deer intended for translocation from a region of the Rio Paraná Basin had been infected previously by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and whether they were carrying virus. We captured marsh deer from June to October 1998 and collected blood from 108 animals and esophageal-pharyngeal fluid from 53. Serum was tested for antibodies against three FMDV serotypes (O, A, and C) by liquid-phase-blocking sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Esophageal-pharyngeal fluid was tested for FMDV RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and inoculation into three successive baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cell subcultures, followed by RT-PCR of cultures. We detected low log(10) titers (range 1.0-1.5) to FMDV subtype A(24) Cruzeiro in 19 of 108 sampled marsh deer, but failed to isolate FMDV or detect FMDV RNA in any samples. We conclude that marsh deer from our study site were unlikely to carry FMDV; however, as a preventive measure, the 19 animals with titers for FMDV were not sent to FMDV-free Brazilian states.

      Active surveillance for lyssaviruses was conducted among populations of bats in the Philippines. The presence of past or current Lyssavirus infection was determined by use of direct fluorescent antibody assays on bat brains and virus neutralization assays on bat sera. Although no bats were found to have active infection with a Lyssavirus, 22 had evidence of neutralizing antibody against the Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV). Seropositivity was statistically associated with one species of bat, Miniopterus schreibersi. Results from the virus neutralization assays are consistent with the presence in the Philippines of a naturally occurring Lyssavirus related to ABLV.

      During investigations into recent population decreases in Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica) 21 animals found dead or dying were necropsied. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of a pestivirus in organs from two of the 21 chamois. From one of these animals a pestivirus was isolated from the spleen, skin and serum. The virus had better growth in ovine than in bovine cells and was neutralized most effectively by an anti-border disease virus (BDV) reference antiserum. Using panpestivirus and genotype-specific primers selected from 5'-untranslated region (UTR) of the pestivirus genome, BDV RNA was demonstrated by RT-PCR. Comparison of the chamois sequences from 5'-UTR, entire N(pro) and E2 gene coding regions with those of other pestivirus genotypes revealed that this virus did not fall into any of the pestivirus genotypes identified so far. Results of phylogenetic analysis suggested that the chamois pestivirus was closely related to BDV and it was typed as BDV-4 genotype.

      Serological studies for arboviruses were conducted on 725 animal sera collected in 22 Ontario townships between 1975 and 1980 including 44 coyote (Canis latrans), 277 red fox (Vulpes vulpes), 192 raccoon (Procyon lotor) and 212 striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis). Hemagglutination inhibition antibodies to two flaviviruses, namely St. Louis encephalitis and Powassan were found in 50% of coyote, 47% of skunk, 26% of fox and 10% of raccoon sera. Similarly, hemagglutination inhibition antibodies to a California serogroup virus, snowshoe hare, were found in 12% of fox, 7% of skunk, 7% of raccoon and 5% of coyote sera. No antibodies were detected to two alphavirus, namely eastern equine encephalitis and western equine encephalitis, antigens. This study affirms the endemic presence of Powassan and snowshoe hare virus and further delineates the scope of St. Louis encephalitis activity in Ontario.

      A Mamastrovirus was identified in an outbreak of diarrhea in cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus). Five young adult and two adult cheetahs presented with lethargy, anorexia, watery diarrhea and regurgitation over an 11-day period. Fecal samples were submitted for electron microscopy and culture. Electron microscopy results revealed particles morphologically consistent with an astrovirus, and no other viral pathogens or significant bacterial pathogens were identified. The astrovirus was confirmed and sequenced using consensus astroviral PCR, resulting in a 367 base pair partial RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) product and a 628 base pair partial capsid product. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed on both the RdRp and the capsid protein segments. All animals were monitored and treated with bismuth subsalicylate tablets (524mg PO BID for 5 days), and recovered without additional intervention. This is the first report we are aware of documenting an astrovirus outbreak in cheetah.

      During 1997, two new viruses were isolated from outbreaks of disease that occurred in horses, donkeys, cattle and sheep in Peru. Genome characterization showed that the virus isolated from horses (with neurological disorders, 78% fatality) belongs to a new species the Peruvian horse sickness virus (PHSV), within the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. This represents the first isolation of PHSV, which was subsequently also isolated during 1999, from diseased horses in the Northern Territory of Australia (Elsey virus, ELSV). Serological and molecular studies showed that PHSV and ELSV are very similar in the serotype-determining protein (99%, same serotype). The second virus (Rioja virus, RIOV) was associated with neurological signs in donkeys, cattle, sheep and dogs and was shown to be a member of the species Yunnan orbivirus (YUOV). RIOV and YUOV are also almost identical (97% amino acid identity) in the serotype-determining protein. YUOV was originally isolated from mosquitoes in China.

      Coltiviruses are tickborne viruses of the genus Coltivirus. The type species, Colorado tick fever virus (from North America), has been isolated from patients with flulike syndromes, meningitis, encephalitis, and other severe complications. Another coltivirus, Eyach virus, has been isolated from ticks in France and Germany and incriminated in febrile illnesses and neurologic syndromes. Seadornaviruses are endemic in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and China. The prototype virus of the genus, Banna virus (BAV), has been isolated from many mosquito species, humans with encephalitis, pigs, and cattle. Two other seadornaviruses, Kadipiro and Liao Ning, were isolated only from mosquitoes. The epidemiology of seadornaviruses remains poorly documented. Evidence suggests that BAV is responsible for encephalitis in humans. Infection with BAV may be underreported because it circulates in regions with a high incidence of Japanese encephalitis and could be misdiagnosed as this disease.

      The complete nucleotide sequence of Middelburg virus (MIDV) was determined for strain MIDV-857 from Zimbabwe. The isolation of this virus in 1993 from a horse that died showing severe clinical signs represents the first indication that MIDV can cause severe disease in equids. Full-length cDNA copies of the viral genome were successfully synthesized by an innovative RT-PCR amplification approach using an 'anchor primer' combined with the SMART methodology described previously for the synthesis of full-length cDNA copies from genome segments of dsRNA viruses. The MIDV-857 genome is 11,674 nt, excluding the 5'-terminal cap structure and poly(A) tail (which varies in length from approximately 180 to approximately 220 residues). The organization of the genome is like that of other alphaviruses, including a read-through stop codon between the nsP3 and nsP4 genes. However, phylogenetic analyses of the structural protein amino acid sequences suggested that the MIDV E1 gene was generated by recombination with a Semliki Forest virus-like virus. This hypothesis was supported by bootscanning analysis using a recombination-detection program. The 3' untranslated region of MIDV-857 also contains a 112 nt duplication. This study reports the first full-length sequence of MIDV, which was obtained from a single RT-PCR product.

      Small mammals were collected in natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Slovenia, Yugoslavia, and a hantavirus was isolated from the lungs of an Apodemus flavicol lis captured in Dobrava village. This new isolate, Dobrava virus, was compared with representative strains of the Hantavirus genus by serological and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods. It was found by cross immunofluorescent and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that antigenic properties of Dobrava virus were different from those of other hantaviruses. The RNA of this virus was successfully amplified with hantavirus genus reactive primer sets by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); however, PCR-RFLP analysis of the amplified product was shown to be unique among those of the known hantaviruses, further indicating that Dobrava virus represents a new hantavirus serotype.

      Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) is an economically important vector-borne viral disease of cattle and buffalo. It has been reported from most of the world's tropical and subtropical regions. In the last few decades, outbreaks of BEF have occurred in Israel almost every other year. Several serological studies have demonstrated a wide range of wild animal species that are positive for BEF virus (BEFV) antibodies. However, the question of whether wild animals and domesticated species other than cattle also play an important role in the maintenance and transmission of BEFV in Israel remains. Here, we examined the prevalence of anti-BEFV antibodies in 942 samples collected from various wild, semi-captive and domesticated animal species during the years 2000-2009 using the serum neutralization (SN) method. SN test revealed the presence of BEFV-neutralizing antibodies in nine samples (0.96%), from three species: Bubalus bubalis (4/29, 13.79%), Gazella g. gazella (3/68, 4.44%) and Dama d. mesopotamica (2/296, 0.68%). All positive samples were collected in areas of earlier outbreaks. The low prevalence of positive animals and the solid correlation with prior outbreaks indicate that the tested species probably do not serve as virus reservoirs and may play only a minor role in the maintenance of BEFV in the Middle East.

      Retrospective and prospective serological surveys to determine the prevalence of Wesslsbron (WSL) virus infections in animal populations were carried out in different vegetational zones in Nigeria. Sera from 1,492 animals comprising 292 camels, 81 horses, 4 donkeys, 320 cattle, 235 sheep, 260 goats, 114 pigs, 101 dogs and 85 domestic fowls were assayed by haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test for presence of antibodies to WSL virus and other flavivirus antigens: Yellow Fever (YF), Potiskum (POT), Banzi (BAN), Uganda S (UGS) and West Nile (WN) viruses. Four hundred and eighty one (32%) of the total sera tested were positive for the presence of flavivirus antibodies. The prevalence rates among animals varied with species and vegetational zones of the country. The highest prevalence was noted in animals from a swamp forest zone and was higher among camels, horses, donkeys and sheep when compared with goats, pigs and fowls in different zones. Although monotypic reactions with WSL virus antigen were observed in positive sera, the majority of the WSL virus positive sera cross-reacted with more than two other flavivirus antigens. Serological cross-reactions were most extensive in WSL virus positive horse sera. A ten month sentinel survey among 28 cattle, 68 sheep and 30 goats revealed considerable activity of WSL virus in Nigeria. Of these, 11 cattle and 12 sheep showed antibody conversion to WSL virus antigen. None of the goats seroconverted. Although, there are no records of outbreak of WSL disease in Nigeria, this study revealed that WSL virus is actively circulating among livestock populations in this environment. Flavivirus nucleotide data are needed for final determination of genetic relatedness in this group of viruses.

      A sero-epidemiological survey of African horse sickness (AHS) virus in 261 animals which included 96 camels, 81 horses, 80 dogs and 4 donkeys was carried out in Nigeria. The animals had no history of vaccination against AHS. Sera were tested by the haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test for the presence of antibody against AHS virus. Of these, 77 (95.1%) horse, 4 (100%) donkey, 10 (10.4%) camel and 28 (35%) dog sera samples tested were recorded as positive. The prevalence of antibody in samples taken from horses in different regions was similar. The prevalence of antibody to AHS virus detected in camels and dogs suggests that these animals are possible reservoirs of the virus. This may have an influence upon the epidemiology of the disease in Africa as a whole.

      Infestation of small mammals, including common shrews Sorex araneus L., field mice Apodemus agrarius Pallas, and red voles Clethrionomus rutilus Schreber, with immature Ixodes persulcatus ticks and their infection with tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) were studied in the forest-steppe habitat in the vicinity of Novosibirsk, Russia. Larval ticks parasitize all three host species, but virtually all nymphs were found only on field mice and red voles. Detection of the viral RNA using reverse transcription (RT) with subsequent nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) and of viral antigen using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed a high prevalence of TBEV-positive animals in both the summer and winter. The proportion of small mammals with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibodies was significantly lower than with ELISA-detected antibodies. Taken together, the data suggest that small mammals may maintain TBEV as a persistent infection throughout the year.

      Seven clinical cases of cutaneous papillomatosis in yaks were studied in Arunachal Pradesh, India. Sporadic, single or a chain of multiple varying size warts appeared around the eyes or on the body. Predominant site of warts was around eyes. Histopathologically, these cases were diagnosed as fibropapilloma. It was confirmed by the detection of BPV-1 and BPV-2 or their mixed infection by PCR and sequencing. Quantitative SYBR Green real-time PCR detected comparatively lower viral DNA copy number in cutaneous warts (CWs). Cases of CWs and its causative agent as bovine papillomavirus (BPVs) are reported for the first time in yaks.

      Thirty-seven yaks (Bos grunniens) with keratoconjunctivitis and 22 healthy yaks were used to investigate the role of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) in keratoconjunctivitis in yaks. Nucleic acid sequences of BoHV-1 glycoproteins B and E were detected in conjunctival swabs from all yaks with keratoconjunctivitis using a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In 21 yaks, BoHV-1 sequences were detected along with Moraxella bovis (M. bovis) and Neisseria spp. The amplified BoHV-1 sequences were identical, and no nucleotide variation was observed when compared with a BoHV-1 reference strain using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of the amplified DNA sequences. Interestingly, BoHV-1 sequences could not be detected in samples from healthy yaks. However, conjunctival swabs from two healthy yaks (9.09%) yielded M. bovis and Neisseria spp. Samples from 35 yaks with keratoconjunctivitis showed positive reactions in an avidin biotin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for BoHV-1 antibodies; all the healthy yaks were seronegative. This is the first report of a possible association of BoHV-1 with keratoconjunctivitis in yaks.

      From September 2005 through October 2006, fibromatosis was diagnosed in 2 red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and 1 gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). All 3 squirrels had multifocal to coalescing, tan, firm alopecic cutaneous nodules. Two squirrels also had pulmonary nodules. Histologically, the cutaneous nodules had marked epidermal hyperplasia, with ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes, spongiosis, and eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. The dermis was expanded by proliferation of atypical mesenchymal cells with cytoplasmic inclusions. Additional findings included pulmonary adenomatous hyperplasia with cytoplasmic inclusions, renal tubular epithelial hyperplasia with cytoplasmic inclusions, atypical mesenchymal proliferation in the liver, and atypical mesenchymal proliferation with cytoplasmic inclusions in the seminal vesicles. Ultrastructurally, poxviral particles were observed in skin scrapings and sections of cutaneous and pulmonary nodules. Polymerase chain reaction targeting the highly conserved Leporipoxvirus DNA polymerase gene was positive using DNA extracted from the cutaneous lesions of all 3 squirrels. Nucleotide sequence of the 390 base PCR amplicons was closely related to that of other members of the genus Leporipoxvirus. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of cutaneous and systemic poxviral disease in American red squirrels with molecular characterization of the squirrel fibroma virus.

      An apparently helper-dependent parvovirus was isolated from a penile flat condylomatous lesion by inoculating the material into a culture of human fibroblasts, and by coinfecting these cells with adenovirus type 12. Upon addition of an adenovirus helper, the virus could be readily propagated in human KB cells. Analysis of its DNA revealed that it shares structural similarities with the DNA of the four defective parvoviruses (adeno-associated viruses, AAV) described so far, but that the cleavage pattern obtained after digesting the DNA with restriction enzymes is different from that of AAV 1-AAV 4. Nucleic acid hybridization data further support the assumption that the isolated defective parvovirus is not identical with the other four serotypes. When conditions of high stringency were used, only weak cross-reactivity was seen with the DNAs of AAV 1-AAV 4, whereas the latter showed strong cross-hybridization with each other. The organization of the DNA of the newly isolated parvovirus was investigated by mapping the cleavage sites of several restriction enzymes. It is proposed to designate the new isolate as AAV 5.

      Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome. Their pathogenic potential, ecology, and evolutionary features are largely unexplored. Here, we describe the molecular analysis of porcine PBVs identified in the intestinal content of dead pigs. Six of 13 positive samples were cloned and then subjected to single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and nucleotide sequencing. All clones belonged to genogroup I PBVs and almost all clones clustered on separate branches from human strains. A single strain shared a notably close genetic relationship with a Hungarian human PBV strain (89.9 nt and 96.4% aa identity). Genetic diversity was also observed among strains identified in mixed infections. Single point mutations and deleterious mutations within highly related strains suggested that PBVs exist as quasispecies in the swine alimentary tract. Clones with complete sequence identities originating from different animals suggested effective animal-to-animal transmission of the virus. Our findings indicate that infection with genogroup I PBVs is common in pigs.

      Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an important viral disease of sheep and goats. The wildlife hosts of PPR, which may play an important role in the epidemiology of this disease, are not well characterized. The research was undertaken to study the infection of PPR virus (PPRV) in free-living bharals (Pseudois nayaur) in Tibet, China. In 2007, PPRV infection was confirmed in two bharals in Rutog County of Tibet based on clinical signs and detection of PPRV RNA in tissue samples. In 2008, PPRV infection was found in one bharal in Ge'gyai County of Tibet by competitive ELISA, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and sequence analysis of PPRV fusion protein (F) and nucleoprotein (N) gene segments. The PPRV variant identified in infected bharal was closely related to other circulating PPRV variants recently identified in sheep and goats from Tibet. This is the first report of PPRV infection in free-living bharals.

      Ten virus isolates were obtained from three species of marine mammals sampled on San Miguel Island (California, USA) and 1,200 km north on Rogue Reef (Oregon, USA) during tagging operations in 1986-87. Seven of these 10 were derived from 30 sampled Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus pups, while two of 10 were isolated from one of 19 sampled California sea lion (Zalophus californianus californianus pups, and the remaining isolate was derived from 30 sampled northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) pups. All 10 isolates were identified as belonging to a single serotype, reptilian calicivirus Crotalus type 1 (RCV Cro-1), previously isolated from both healthy and diseased snakes and frogs in a California zoologic collection. The marine samples also showed that nine of 30 Steller sea lion pups, one of 19 California sea lion pups and zero of 30 fur seal pups were producing type specific neutralizing antibodies to RCV Cro-1. This represents the first reported instance of the isolation from marine sources of calicivirus originally isolated from a terrestrial species.

      Twenty-four species of South African wild animals were tested for the presence of antibodies against the viruses of 16 common diseases of domestic animals. Positive results were obtained for African horsesickness, equine encephalosis, equid herpes virus-1, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Allerton disease (Herpes mammillitis), lumpy skin disease, parainfluenza, encephalomyocarditis, bluetongue, Wesselsbron disease, bovine ephemeral fever, and Akabane disease complex. No antibodies could be demonstrated against the viruses of equine influenza, equine infectious anaemia, equine viral arteritis and Rift Valley fever. The negative results substantiate observations that the latter diseases, with the exception of equine viral arteritis, are absent in South Africa. The number of animal species found positive for a specific virus, ranged from 0-16. No antibodies were found in crocodiles and warthogs, whereas antibodies against Wesselsbron and bovid herpes virus-1 were present in 16 species. Antibodies against viruses of horses were found almost exclusively in zebras and, although elephants reacted to African horsesickness, no neutralizing antibodies against it could be demonstrated in their sera. Zebras were also found to be positive for Wesselsbron and Akabane, which are usually regarded as viruses of ruminants. Antibodies against most viruses were encountered in all vegetation zones in South Africa but, as a rule, most viruses were more prevalent in the high-rainfall zone in KwaZulu-Natal.

      The presence of antibodies against equine encephalosis virus (EEV) and equid herpesvirus 1 and 4 in zebra in the Kruger National Park (KNP) was demonstrated. The ability of zebra to maintain immunity against EEV is illustrated by the appearance of neutralizing antibodies in most zebra foals within months of losing their maternal immunity. This occurs in every month of the year, even in winter. The high proportion of serologically positive foals in winter is ascribed to the presence of large numbers of susceptible foals and sufficient numbers of Culicoides vectors even at that time of the year. The high prevalence of antibodies against both herpesviruses is similar to the situation in horses and suggests that herpesvirus infection is endemic among zebra in the KNP.

      The temporary disruption of reproductive activities due to equine coital exanthema (ECE), caused by equid herpesvirus 3 (EHV-3), at thoroughbred breeding facilities and embryo transfer centres, has an appreciable economic impact. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of excretion of EHV-3 in mares without clinical symptoms under field conditions and the re-excretion patterns of the virus in two seropositive (presumably latently infected) mares maintained in isolation for 11 mo. The EHV-3 virus was detected in perineal-vaginal swabs by real time PCR in 14 (6%) of 220 thoroughbred mares without clinical symptoms at the time of breeding. In the two isolated mares, re-excretion of EHV-3 was demonstrated on two occasions, 3 mo apart (each for a 3 d interval) in one mare, and on only 1 d in the other mare. Antibodies against EHV-3 were identified by seroneutralization in 105 (48%) of the thoroughbred mares, and during the entire period in the two isolated mares. Therefore, the present study provided evidence of EHV-3 shedders in a healthy mare population under both field and isolation conditions. Furthermore, at least two periods of spontaneous EHV-3 reactivation and re-excretion in the presence of serum antibodies occurred in one mare in an 11 mo interval. These findings could assist in the design and implementation of measures to minimize the spread of EHV-3 and control ECE outbreaks.

      To determine the exposure of free-ranging pronghorns (Antilocapra americana Ord) to selected pathogens, serum samples were obtained from 33 live-trapped animals from southwestern Saskatchewan in 1970, and from 26 and 51 animals from southeastern Alberta, in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Antibodies were found to the agents of parainfluenza 3, bovine virus diarrhea, eastern and western encephalomyelitis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis and the chlamydial group. No serologic reactors were found to the agents of bluetongue, epizootic hemorrhagic disease, brucellosis, or leptospirosis (4 serotypes).

      Since the discovery of the Marburg and Ebola species of filovirus, seemingly random, sporadic fatal outbreaks of disease in humans and nonhuman primates have given impetus to identification of host tropisms and potential reservoirs. Domestic swine in the Philippines, experiencing unusually severe outbreaks of porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome, have now been discovered to host Reston ebolavirus (REBOV). Although REBOV is the only member of Filoviridae that has not been associated with disease in humans, its emergence in the human food chain is of concern. REBOV isolates were found to be more divergent from each other than from the original virus isolated in 1989, indicating polyphyletic origins and that REBOV has been circulating since, and possibly before, the initial discovery of REBOV in monkeys.

      Flavivirus is a genus of arthropod-transmitted viruses of the family Flaviviridae, and in Brazil, up to eleven different Flavivirus have been isolated. We collected blood from farmers in the municipality of Theobroma, which is located 320km from the City of Porto Velho, the former capital of the Brazilian State of Rondônia. For viral isolation, we used newborn mouse brain, followed by RT-PCR with specific universal Flavivirus primers. We obtained fragments 958bp and 800bp in length. Based on BLAST, these sequences were 91% similar to a sequence of Cacipacore virus.

      A polymerase chain reaction test for the detection of ovine herpesvirus-2 (OHV-2) DNA was used to identify sites of OHV-2 infection in peri-natal lambs and in adult sheep. OHV-2 was detected in the nasal secretions from all lambs within a period of two months following birth. Subsequently, OHV-2 DNA was identified in a number of epithelial tissues including the cornea, turbinates and pharynx. In addition, OHV-2 DNA was detected exclusively in B-lymphocytes from six of ten adult sheep tested. An infection cycle for OHV-2 in sheep is proposed which bears similarities with the gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr virus and mouse herpesvirus-68.

      The genomes of two new genital human papillomavirus (HPV) types, tentatively named HPVs 39 and 42, have been cloned from biopsy specimens of penile Bowenoid papules and vulvar papillomas, respectively. Blot hybridization experiments, performed under stringent conditions (Tm -10 degrees), have revealed no cross-hybridization between the DNAs of HPVs 39 and 42, and between these DNAs and those of other genital and cutaneous HPVs. A significant cross-hybridization has been observed between the DNA of HPV42 and that of HPV32, the latter being associated with oral focal epithelial hyperplasia. The fraction of HPV32 and HPV42 hybrid molecules resistant to nuclease S1 treatment after hybridization in liquid phase at saturation has been evaluated to 20%, supporting the view that these HPVs constitute distinct types. In addition to HPV42 DNA, a 6.8-kb BamHI fragment, cross-hybridizing with HPV39 DNA, has been cloned from the vulvar papilloma DNA preparation. The cross-hybridization has been evaluated to 16%, pointing to the existence of an additional HPV39-related type. Electron microscope analysis of heteroduplex molecules formed between HPV32 and HPV42 DNAs showed paired regions over about 60 and 87% of their genome lenghts under stringent (Tm -18 degrees) and nonstringent (Tm -42 degrees) conditions, respectively. The 6.8-kb HPV DNA and HPV39 DNA formed paired regions over about 63 and 95% of the 6.8-kb fragment length at Tm -18 degrees and Tm -26 degrees, respectively. These data point to greater DNA sequence homologies than anticipated from the percentages of nuclease S1 resistance. Heteroduplex mapping has allowed the alignment of the physical maps of HPV39 and 42 DNAs and of the 6.8-kb HPV DNA with the map of the open reading frames of the HPV16 genome. So far, HPV42 has been detected only in benign genital lesions showing usually no cell atypia. HPV39 has been detected in a few cases of intraepithelial neoplasias and invasive carcinomas of the uterine cervix. The viral DNA sequences have been found integrated into the cell genome in all four HPV39-associated cervical cancers of our series. It seems most likely that HPV42 belongs to the low-risk group of genital HPVs, while HPV39 represents a potentially oncogenic genital HPV type.

      A disease outbreak characterized by lesions of the skin and mucosa of the oral cavity was recognized in harbor seals ( Phoca vitulina) from the German North Sea. Using electron microscopy typical parapoxvirus particles were observed. The presence of parapoxvirus was confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing of part of the putative major envelope protein coding gene. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that the virus from seal is significantly different from the established parapoxvirus species Orf virus, Bovine papular stomatitis virus, Pseudocowpox virus, and Parapoxvirus of red deer in New Zealand. The results of our analysis provide evidence for inclusion of the seal parapoxvirus as member of a separate species within the genus Parapoxvirus.

      The complete Npro coding sequences were determined for 16 pestiviruses isolated from cattle, pig, and several wild ruminant species including reindeer, bison, deer, and bongo. Phylogenetic analysis enabled the segregation of pestiviruses into the established species bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1), BVDV-2, border disease virus (BDV), and classical swine fever virus (CSFV). For BVDV-1 five distinct subgroups were identified, while BVDV-2, BDV, and CSFV were each subdivided into two subgroups. The virus isolates from bongo and deer as well as one porcine virus isolate belong to BVDV-1. Interestingly, the isolates from reindeer and bison are distinct from the established pestivirus species. The Npro sequences from these two viruses are more similar to BDV than to the other pestivirus species. Calculation of the pairwise evolutionary distances allowed a clear separation of the categories species, subgroup, and isolate only when the reindeer/bison viruses were considered as members of an additional pestivirus species. Furthermore, the entire E2 coding sequences of a representative set of virus isolates covering all recognized species and subgroups were studied. Segregation of pestiviruses based on the E2 region was identical with that obtained with the N(pro) sequences.

      The 5' nontranslated region (NTR) of pestiviruses functions as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that mediates cap-independent translation of the viral polyprotein and probably contains additional cis-acting RNA signals involved in crucial processes of the viral life cycle. Computer modeling suggests that the 5'-terminal 75 nucleotides preceding the IRES element form two stable hairpins, Ia and Ib. Spontaneous and engineered mutations located in the genomic region comprising Ia and Ib were characterized by using infectious cDNA clones of bovine viral diarrhea virus. Spontaneous 5' NTR mutations carrying between 9 and 26 A residues within the loop region of Ib had no detectable influence on specific infectivity and virus growth properties. After tissue culture passages, multiple insertions and deletions of A residues occurred rapidly. In contrast, an engineered mutant carrying 5 A residues within the Ib loop was genetically stable during 10 tissue culture passages. This virus was used as starting material to generate a number of additional mutants. The analyses show that (i) deletion of the entire Ib loop region resulted in almost complete loss of infectivity that was rapidly restored during passages in cell culture by insertions of variable numbers of A residues; (ii) mutations within the 5'-terminal 4 nucleotides of the genomic RNA severely impaired virus replication; passaging of the supernatants obtained after transfection resulted in the emergence of efficiently replicating mutants that had regained the conserved 5'-terminal sequence; (iii) provided the conserved sequence motif 5'-GUAU was retained at the 5' end of the genomic RNA, substitutions and deletions of various parts of hairpin Ia or deletion of all of Ia and part of Ib were found to support replication, but to a lower degree than the parent virus. Restriction of specific infectivity and virus growth of the 5' NTR mutants correlated with reduced amounts of accumulated viral RNAs.

      The complete nucleotide sequence of Great Island virus (GIV) genome was determined, along with genome segments (Seg) 1, 2 and 6 of Kemerovo (KEMV), Lipovnik (LIPV) and Tribec (TRBV) viruses. All four viruses, together with Broadhaven virus, are currently classified within the species Great Island virus and have been isolated from ticks, birds or humans. Sequence comparisons showed that Seg-4 of GIV encoded the outer-capsid protein responsible for cell attachment, although it was approximately half the length of its counterpart in the Culicoides or mosquito-transmitted orbiviruses. A second overlapping ORF (in the +2 reading frame) was identified in Seg-9 of GIV, encoding a putative dsRNA-binding protein. Phylogenetic analyses of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Pol) and T2 protein amino acid sequences indicated that the tick-borne orbiviruses represent an ancestral group from which the mosquito-borne orbiviruses have evolved. This mirrors the evolutionary relationships between the arthropod vectors of these viruses, supporting a co-speciation hypothesis for these arboviruses and their arthropod-vectors. Phylogenetic analyses of the T2 proteins of KEMV, LIPV, TRBV and GIV (showing 82% amino acid identity) correlated with the early classification of Great Island viruses as two distinct serocomplexes (Great Island and Kemerovo serocomplexes). Amino acid identity levels in the VP1(Pol) and T2 proteins between the two serocomplexes were 73 and 82%, respectively, whilst those between previously characterized Orbivirus species are 53-73% and 26-83%, respectively. These data suggest that, despite limited genome segment reassortment between these two groups, their current classification within the same Orbivirus species could be re-evaluated.

      Equids are commonly infected by herpesviruses, but isolation of herpesviruses from mules has apparently not been previously reported. Furthermore, the genomic relationships among the various equid herpesviruses are poorly characterized. We describe the isolation and preliminary characterization of a mule gammaherpesvirus tentatively identified as asinine herpesvirus-2 (AHV-2; also designated equid herpesvirus-7 (EHV-7)) from the nasal secretions (NS) of a healthy mule in northern California. The virus was initially identified by transmission electron microscopic examination of lysates of cell culture inoculated with NS collected from the mule. A 913 nucleotide sequence of the DNA polymerase gene was amplified using degenerate primers, and comparison of this sequence with those of various other herpesviruses showed that the mule herpesvirus was most closely related to EHV-2 (AHV-2 sequences were not available for comparison). The sequence of a shorter portion (166 nucleotides) of the mule herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene was identical to that of the published sequence of an asinine gammaherpesvirus, previously designated as AHV-4-3 (AY054992). AHV-2 was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in the NS of approximately 8% of a cohort of 114 healthy mules and 13 donkeys.

      In 1990, dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) killed thousands of striped dolphins in the Mediterranean. Subsequently, the prevalence of the infection declined in this species. In 2006-2008, the virus killed not only numerous striped dolphins but also long-finned pilot whales. All partial sequences of the phosphoprotein and nucleoprotein genes obtained thus far from different host species during the 2006-2008 outbreak show 100% identity, suggesting that a single virus was involved, and these sequences are nearly identical to the 1990 Spanish strain. Here our first objective was to determine the sequence identity between the morbillivirus from the 2006-2008 outbreak and the 1990 Spanish strain by sequencing more extensive genomic regions of strains from one pilot whale and one striped dolphin stranded in 2007. The second objective was to investigate the relationship between the 1990 and 2007 strains by constructing a phylogenetic tree based on the phosphoprotein gene to compare several Cetacean morbilliviruses, and another tree based on the nearly complete genomes of Mediterranean DMV. The third objective was to identify the most variable regions in the DMV genomes. Results showed that the two 2007 Spanish strains were 99.9% identical over 9050 bp and should be considered the same virus, and that this virus is 99.3-99.4% similar to the 1990 Spanish strain. The phylogenetic trees, together with the common geographical area for the two outbreaks, suggest that the 2007 DMV strains evolved from the 1990 DMV strain. Pilot whales do not seem to have been exposed or infected during the 1990-1992 epidemic, since these populations appeared to be immunologically naïve in 2006-2008. Our results suggest that the virus may have evolved in striped dolphin populations prior to the 2006-2008 outbreak, after which it entered the long-finned pilot whale, perhaps aided by an alanine to valine mutation in the N-terminal domain of the fusion protein.

      Exotic wildlife can introduce new diseases or act as reservoirs of endemic diseases. On White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico (USA), significant declines in populations of native ungulates generally correspond to increases in range and population density of the exotic gemsbok (Oryx gazella gazella), introduced beginning in 1969. We surveyed gemsbok in 2001 for exposure to a variety of diseases potentially important for native ungulates. High seroprevalence was found for malignant catarrhal fever virus (49 [98%] of 50 sera; 43 [96%] of 45 plasma samples), blue-tongue virus (48 [96%] of 50), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (33 [66%] of 50), and parainfluenza-3 virus (10 [20%] of 50). Low numbers of Nematodirus spp. eggs in a few individuals were the only parasites detected in gemsbok. Exposure to the above diseases in gemsbok is of interest to managers because of potential implications for recovery of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) and desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus crooki) in the White Sands area because each has been implicated in mortality in these species either in the White Sands area or elsewhere in the western/southwestern United States.

      The purpose of this study was to extend our knowledge on the geographic and natural rodent host ranges of New World arenaviruses in California. Sera from 1,094 sigmodontine and 112 murine rodents were tested for antibody against Whitewater Arroyo and Amapari viruses. Antibody was found in 55 (4.6%) of the 1,206 rodents: 4 from northwestern San Diego County, 3 from Los Angeles County, and 48 from Orange County. The antibody-positive rodents included 8 (7.8%) of 103 Neotoma fuscipes, 1 (0.6%) of 180 Neotoma lepida, 1 (3.1%) of 32 Peromyscus boylii, 8 (11.0%) of 73 Peromyscus californicus, 1 (1.2%) of 85 Peromyscus eremicus, 30 (8.5%) of 353 Peromyscus maniculatus, and 6 (2.2%) of 268 Reithrodontomys megalotis. This study provides the first evidence that New World arenaviruses occur in Los Angeles and Orange counties and northwestern San Diego County, and the first evidence that Peromyscus and Reithrodontomys species are naturally infected with New World arenaviruses.

      Gene sequences related to a retrovirus (oncornavirus type D) isolated from a lung cell culture from spectacled langur (Presbytis obscurus) are found in multiple copies (20-40 per haploid genome) in langur cellular DNA; partially homologous virogene sequences are present in the DNA of related Old World monkey species. Primates thus contain gene sequences for at least two distinct classes of genetically transmitted oncornaviruses, the type C class (isolated from baboons) and the type D class described here. The langur virus is partially related to Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, a type D retrovirus isolated from rhesus monkeys. Nucleic acid hybridization studies suggest that Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, now infectious among primates, was derived from an endogenous virus of langurs or from another member of the primate sub-family Colobinae.

      This study reports the first conclusive evidence of zoonotic camelpox virus (CMLV) infection in humans associated with outbreaks in dromedarian camels (Camelus dromedaries) in northwest region of India during 2009. CMLV infection is usually restricted to camels and causes localised skin lesions but occasionally leads to generalised form of disease. However, the present outbreak involved camel handlers and attendants with clinical manifestations such as papules, vesicles, ulceration and finally scabs over fingers and hands. In camels, the pock-like lesions were distributed over the hairless parts of the body. On the basis of clinical and epidemiological features coupled with serological tests and molecular characterization of the causative agent, CMLV zoonosis was confirmed in three human cases. Clinical samples such as skin scabs/swabs and blood collected from affected animals and humans were analysed initially, for the presence of CMLV-specific antigen and antibodies by counter immunoelectrophoresis (CIE); serum neutralization test (SNT); plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) and indirect immunoperoxidase test which was later confirmed by amplification of CMLV-specific ankyrin repeat protein (C18L) gene. Virus isolation was successful only from samples collected from camels. Further, sequence analyses based on three full-length envelope protein genes (A27L, H3L and D8L) revealed 95.2-99.8% and 93.1-99.3% homology with other Orthopoxviruses at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Phylogram of the three genes revealed a close relationship of CMLV with Variola virus (VARV). Considering the emerging and re-emerging nature of the virus, its genetic relatedness to VARV, zoonotic potential and productivity losses in camels; the control measures are imperative in curtailing economic and public health impact of the disease. This is the first instance of laboratory confirmed camelpox zoonosis in India.

      H-1 virus and Kilham rat virus (KRV) are autonomous parvoviruses which generally cause subclinical infections in rats and can cause persistent infections in cell cultures. In this study, primer sets specific for either H-1 or KRV were designed on the basis of DNA sequence comparisons of the rodent parvoviruses. The specificities of the H-1 and KRV-specific primer sets were determined by testing viral preparations of seven different parvoviruses and nine other viruses known to infect rodents. The H-1-specific PCR assay amplified the expected 254-bp product only in the presence of H-1 viral DNA and was able to detect as little as 100 fg of H-1 viral DNA. The KRV-specific PCR assay generated the expected 281-bp product only when KRV viral DNA was used as the template and was able to detect as little as 10 pg of KRV viral DNA. Each assay was able to detect its respective virus in tissues from rats experimentally infected with H-1 or KRV. In contrast, no product was amplified by either assay with tissues from mock-infected rats. Our findings indicate that these PCR assays provide rapid, specific, and sensitive methods for the detection of H-1 or KRV infection in rats and cell culture systems.

      Sheeppox and goatpox outbreaks occur often in India incurring huge economic loss to the small ruminant industry. This paper describes two sheeppox outbreaks, of which one occurred in an organized sheep breeding farm at Makhdoom (Uttar Pradesh), India, during 2007 and another in goats at the Central Institute of Research on Goats, Makhdoom (Uttar Pradesh), India during 2008. In the first outbreak, a local Muzaffarnagari sheep breed was affected (n=477) with morbidity and mortality rates, respectively, of 100% and 53.9% accompanied by significant productivity losses. In the 2008 outbreaks, a small number of goats were affected without any mortality. The tissue and swabs collected from both the outbreaks were processed and inoculated onto Vero cells, and the causative agent of the outbreaks, capripox virus (CaPV), was isolated. The identity of the virus was confirmed as CaPV based on electron microscopy, experimental pathogenesis in sheep, capripox-specific conventional and real-time PCRs. Sequence analysis of the P32 envelope protein gene revealed that the causative agent of both outbreaks was confirmed as sheeppox virus (SPPV) implying SPPV infection not only in sheep but also goats in India.

      Human hantavirus disease occurs throughout much of South America. The rodent hosts and the specific etiologic agent(s) are largely unknown, but many reported cases occurred within the habitation ranges of oryzomine rodents (rice rats). We have identified a genetically novel hantavirus (Rio Mamore virus [RM]) of the pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys microtis in Bolivia. The complete sequence of the small (S) genome and the partial sequence of the medium (M) genome are described. This virus is closely related to the newly identified human pathogen Andes virus from Patagonia. To facilitate improved diagnosis of hantavirus infections in South America, we have expressed the complete nucleocapsid protein of RM in Escherichia coli and affinity-purified it for use in an ELISA and Western blot assays for antibodies to RM.

      Picobirnaviruses are a group of unclassified, non-enveloped, small spherical viruses, 35-41 nm in diameter without any apparent surface morphology. They have characteristic bisegmented double stranded RNA genome of two types namely large profile (2.3-2.6 kbp for the larger and 1.5-1.9 kbp for the smaller segment, respectively) or small profile (1.75 and 1.55 kbp for segments 1 and 2, respectively). Human picobirnaviruses (n=12 positives; 2/56 diarrhoeic children and 10/607 non-diarrhoeic children) with large (n=11) or small (n=1) genome pattern were observed in faecal specimens of children from a slum community by silver stained PAGE gels. Faecal specimen from four asymptomatic cases (P597_02_IND, K135_02_IND, A373_03_IND, A356_03_IND) and one diarrhoeic case (K135_03_IND) had genogroup I picobirnaviruses (1-CHN-97 like) showing amplicons within the 201 bp region, with primers PicoB25-PicoB43, targeting the conserved domain of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. It was interesting to note that only the PBV strain P597_02_IND from Kolkata with large genome was closely related to a reported strain (similarity with 2-GA-91 from USA was 87% at the nucleotide level and 90% at the amino acid level). Sequence analysis showed three conserved amino acid domains as well as a highly conserved D-S-D motif, characteristic of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of bisegmented, double stranded RNA viruses. Sequence data of the picobirnavirus A356_03_IND indicated strong heterogeneity with all other picobirnavirus strains sequenced till date. After nearly a decade a genogroup II picobirnavirus strain (R227_03_IND) was isolated from a diarrhoea case in the community, with small genome profile and amplified with specific primers PicoB23-PicoB24; but the sequence data showed that it was divergent from the hitherto reported prototype strain 4-GA-91 of genogroup II human picobirnaviruses.

      Two known guinea pig herpesviruses, guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) and guinea pig herpes-like virus (GPHLV), and well characterized. A third herpesvirus (GPXV) was originally isolated from leukocytes of healthy strain 2 guinea pigs. Growth of GPXV in guinea pig embryo fibroblastic cells produced a characteristic cytopathic effect. Electron microscopy of guinea pig cells infected with GPXV revealed the morphological development of a herpesvirus. Cross-neutralization tests and immunoferritin electron microscopy demonstrated that GPXV, GPCMV, and GPHLV were serologically distinct herpeviruses of guinea pigs. To confirm the distinction between these three herpesviruses, DNA genomes were compared by CsCl equilibrium buoyant density measurements and restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis. 32P-labeled viral DNA ws obtained from nucleocapsids isolated from virus-infected cells, and the buoyant density of GPXV DNA differed from that of GPCMV and GPHLV. Cleavage of viral DNAs with restriction endonucleases followed by gel electrophoresis revealed distinct patterns for each virus.

      Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major causes of bovine respiratory disease worldwide. In order to study the molecular epidemiology of the virus, samples from 30 BRSV outbreaks in cattle herds located in different parts of Sweden were collected from 2007 to 2011. The samples were analyzed by PCR, and the glycoprotein (G) gene was sequenced. BRSV was detected in outbreaks of respiratory disease in both dairy and feedlot herds most often during the winter period but also during the summer months (May to August). This indicates that circulation of the virus between herds occurs throughout the year. Comparative sequence analysis revealed a high degree (more than 94.5%) of sequence identity among the collected strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 29 out of the 30 strains formed a unique clade. Identical sequences found in herds sampled within a few months' time suggested that these herds were part of a common transmission chain. One strain from a single outbreak in a herd in southern Sweden clustered with Danish strains and showed a distant relationship to the rest of the Swedish strains. Further studies are highly warranted to clarify the inter-herd transmission routes of BRSV. Such knowledge is essential for the control of the spread of this virus between herds, regions and even countries.

      Directly transmitted parasites often provide substantial information about the temporal and spatial characteristics of host-to-host contact. Here, we demonstrate that a fast-evolving virus (feline immunodeficiency virus, FIV) can reveal details of the contemporary population structure and recent demographic history of its natural wildlife host (Puma concolor) that were not apparent from host genetic data and would be impossible to obtain by other means. We suggest that rapidly evolving pathogens may provide a complementary tool for studying population dynamics of their hosts in ""shallow"" time.

      The objective of this work was to search for potential wildlife reservoir hosts of Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) in wildlife species. From 1994 to 2006, 317 blood and tissue samples were collected from 17 wildlife species in Greece. Encephalomyocarditis virus was isolated only from two Rattus rattus. In addition, antibody to EMCV were detected in sera from 39 Rattus rattus, one Apodemus sylvaticus, one Microtus arvalis, and 13 Sus scrofa.

      A survey was carried out in horse, zebra, elephant, camel, sheep and goat and wild carnivore sera for virus-serum neutralising antibody to the nine type strains of African horse sickness virus. Antibody was found amongst the horse, zebra and elephant sera to all nine different strains. No antibody was detected in any sera from camels, sheep and goats. None was found in sera from hyaena and jackals in this series but had been detected earlier.

      Four antigenically related transmissible agents were recovered from canine fecal specimens. The agents produced cytopathic effects in a continuous dog cell line developed in this laboratory. Increased antibody titers were demonstrated in three of the four dogs which provided the isolates. The virus did not produce cytopathic effects in primary canine kidney or thymus cell cultures, or in cell cultures of human, simian, porcine, bovine, feline, and murine origin. The agent is resistant to ether, chloroform, and heat treatment, and the growth of the virus is inhibited by 5-iodo-2-deoxyuridine. After acridine orange staining, green fluorescent intranuclear inclusions are seen in infected cell cultures. By electron microscopy, the virions measure approximately 20 to 21 nm in overall diameter and are present in the nuclei of infected cells. These properties are consistent with membership in the parvovirus or picodnavirus group. The agent hemagglutinates rhesus red blood cells at 5 C and by hemagglutination-inhibition tests could be readily distinguished from H-1, rat virus, and the minute virus of mice. Canine gamma globulin contains high titers of neutralizing antibody and neutralizing antibody was found in a high percentage of military dogs and in beagles of a breeding colony.

      Forty-seven common dolphins (Delphinus delphis ponticus) were stranded on the northern shores of the Black Sea between mid-July and early September 1994, more than in previous or subsequent years. Two of the 47 dolphins were examined in detail to try to determine the cause of the increased stranding rate. Their lesions included broncho-interstitial pneumonia with type II epithelial cell hyperplasia and multinucleate syncytial cells, neuronal necrosis, gliosis, and non-suppurative meningitis of the brain, necrotic stomatitis, gastroenteritis and cholangitis, and lymphoid depletion of the spleen and lymph nodes. The diseased tissues stained positive in an immunoperoxidase test, using a polyclonal antiserum to measles virus as the primary antibody, and electron microscopy showed that they contained regularly-shaped intranuclear particles about 22 nm in diameter. They were positive by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the nucleoprotein gene of morbillivirus. However, there was no evidence of morbillivirus in frozen tissues either by virus isolation or by antigen capture ELISA. The concentration of sigma DDTS in the blubber of both dolphins was about 50 to 100 times higher than the levels in toothed cetaceans from the North Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, and Baltic Sea. The lesions were consistent with those found in other species with morbilliviral disease, and the positive immunoperoxidase test, PCR and electron microscopical examination confirmed a morbillivirus as the primary cause of these lesions.

      The aim of this work was to detect serologic evidence of influenza virus infections in South American fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) that inhabit the Uruguayan coast. In 29 of 37 serum samples that were analyzed, we identified antibodies to at least one of the following antigens: H1N1 (A/NewCaledonia/20/99), B/Beijing/184/93-like viruses, B/Hong Kong/330/01, and B/Sichuan/379/99 by means of the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI). Results confirmed that influenza A viruses circulate in marine mammals and also showed, for the first time, indirect evidence of influenza B infections in Arctocephalus australis.

      During 2007, 49 states and Puerto Rico reported 7,258 cases of rabies in animals and 1 case in a human to the CDC, representing a 4.6% increase from the 6,940 cases in animals and 3 cases in humans reported in 2006. Approximately 93% of the cases were in wildlife, and 7% were in domestic animals. Relative contributions by the major animal groups were as follows: 2,659 raccoons (36.6%), 1,973 bats (27.2%), 1,478 skunks (20.4%), 489 foxes (6.7%), 274 cats (3.8%), 93 dogs (1.3%), and 57 cattle (0.8%). Compared with numbers of reported cases in 2006, cases in 2007 increased among dogs, bats, foxes, and skunks while decreases were reported among cattle, cats, and skunks. Increases in numbers of rabid raccoons during 2007 were reported by 11 of the 20 eastern states where raccoon rabies was enzootic, and reported cases increased by 1.7% overall, compared with 2006. On a national level, the number of rabies cases in skunks during 2007 decreased by 1.1% from the number reported in 2006. Texas reported the greatest number (n = 362) of rabid skunks and the greatest overall state total of animal rabies cases (969). No cases of rabies associated with the dog/coyote rabies virus variant were reported. The United States remains free of dog-to-dog transmission of canine rabies virus variants. The total number of cases of rabies reported nationally in foxes increased 14.5%, compared with 2006. Increases in the number of reported rabid foxes were attributable to greater numbers of foxes reported with the Arctic fox rabies virus variant in Alaska, the Texas gray fox rabies virus variant in Texas, and the raccoon rabies virus variant in Virginia. The 1,973 cases of rabies reported in bats represented a 16.6% increase over numbers reported in 2006. Cases of rabies in dogs and in sheep and goats increased 17.7% and 18.2%, respectively, whereas cases reported in cattle, cats, and horses and mules decreased 30.5%, 13.8%, and 20.8%, respectively. In Puerto Rico, reported cases of rabies in mongooses decreased 51.5%, and rabies in domestic animals, presumably attributable to spillover infection from mongooses, increased 25%. One human rabies case was reported from Minnesota during 2007. Although typing of the rabies virus variant in this case was not possible, an investigation of this case indicated a bat as the most likely source of exposure.

      During 2010, 48 states and Puerto Rico reported 6,154 rabid animals and 2 human rabies cases to the CDC, representing an 8% decrease from the 6,690 rabid animals and 4 human cases reported in 2009. Hawaii and Mississippi did not report any laboratory-confirmed rabid animals during 2010. Approximately 92% of reported rabid animals were wildlife. Relative contributions by the major animal groups were as follows: 2,246 raccoons (36.5%), 1,448 skunks (23.5%), 1,430 bats (23.2%), 429 foxes (6.9%), 303 cats (4.9%), 71 cattle (1.1 %), and 69 dogs (1.1 %). Compared with 2009, number of reported rabid animals decreased across all animal types with the exception of a 1 % increase in the number of reported rabid cats. Two cases of rabies involving humans were reported from Louisiana and Wisconsin in 2010. Louisiana reported an imported human rabies case involving a 19-year-old male migrant farm worker who had a history of a vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) bite received while in Mexico. This represents the first human rabies case reported in the United States confirmed to have been caused by a vampire bat rabies virus variant. Wisconsin reported a human rabies case involving a 70-year-old male that was confirmed to have been caused by a rabies virus variant associated with tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus).

      Infection of laboratory mice by the Murid herpesvirus 4 (MHV-4) is a much studied model system for gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis. Little, however, is known about its natural host range, epidemiology and pathogenesis outside the laboratory. We have studied MHV-4 infection in free-living murids in the UK. Using a combination of serology and PCR analysis, we found that MHV-4 was endemic in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) but not in two species of voles (Clethrionomys glareolus, Microtus agrestis). The sites of detection of viral DNA were the lungs and, less commonly, the spleen, emphasizing the importance of the former in virus persistence during natural infection and confirming similar data in laboratory mice.

      In BMT patients, shedding of BK virus (BKV) in the urine has been strongly but not absolutely correlated to hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). The possible presence of human polyomaviruses in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs), plasma, serum and urine in BMT patients and an association with HC was investigated by a nested PCR assay. Samples from allogeneic BMT patients with and without HC as well as from autologous BMT patients were analyzed. Human polyomaviruses were detected in urine and blood samples of both allogeneic and autologous BMT patients with and without HC. An association between the presence of a specific human polyomavirus in blood and HC was thus not observed.

      Ninety trapped nutria (Myocastor coypus) from a protected area of Piedmont (Italy), including the Po river, were examined for the prevalence for lesions in major viscera, selected serum antibodies and enteric bacteria. Coccidial lesions in the liver included cholangitis, calcification and necrosis. Renal lesions were nonsuppurative interstitial nephritis and a single case of renal adenocarcinoma. The lungs had a 41.1% prevalence of nonsuppurative interstitial pneumonia. Ten of 87 sera (11.5%) had antibodies against Leptospira bratislava, 3 of 87 (3.4%) against Leptospira ichterohaemorrhagiae, 15 of 41 (36.6%) against Toxoplasma gondii, and antibodies against encephalomyocarditis virus were detected in 5 of 78 sera (6.4%). All fecal samples were negative for Salmonella, Shigella, and Pseudomonas, and growth of enterobacteriaceae was in the normal range.

      We conducted virologic investigations on postmortem specimens from 261 free-living European bison (Bison bonasus) from the Bialowieza Primeval Forest, Poland collected between 1990 and 2000. Fifty-four of 94 males had balanoposthitis; none of the 167 female bison examined had reproductive tract lesions. Peripheral blood, swabs, and various tissues were analyzed for bovine viruses as well as for viral DNA by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. An infectious bovine rhinotracheitis like BoHV-1 strain was isolated from the spleen of a female bison calf and additionally was detected by nested PCR from splenic tissue. None of the bison had significant antibody titers against BoHV-1, bovine herpesvirus 2, BoHV-4, caprine herpesvirus 1, cervid herpesvirus 1, or bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) virus-1. However, low antibody titers in two animals indicate that this European bison population has been exposed to BVD virus or BVD-like viruses and BoHV-2.

      Twenty-one blood samples of free-ranging mountain zebras (Equus zebra) from Namibia were tested for equine herpesvirus (EHV-1, -2, -3, -4) specific antibodies by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and neutralization test (NT). Additionally, type-specific nested polymerase chain reactions (nested PCR) were employed for detection of EHV-1, -2 and -4 DNA. Equine herpesvirus-1 antibodies were detected by IFA in all zebras, while only seven serum samples contained EHV-4 IFA antibodies. Sera with high IFA antibodies also were found to neutralize EHV-1 and -4. Furthermore, 20 zebras were EHV-2 seropositive by IFA, and one zebra had EHV-2 neutralizing antibodies. Equine herpesvirus-3 specific antibodies were not detected. We did not amplify EHV-1, -2 or -4 specific DNA sequences in peripheral blood leukocytes of the same zebras using type-specific nested PCR. EHV infections appear to be widespread in free-ranging zebras, as they are in domestic horses.

      A total of 51 sera from a migratory population of Burchell's zebras (Equus burchelli) were collected in the Serengeti National Park (Tanzania) between 1999 and 2001 to assess levels of exposure to equine herpesvirus types 1, 2, 4, 9 (EHV-1, -2, -4, -9), EHV-1 zebra isolate T965, and equine arteritis virus (EAV). Using virus-specific neutralizing antibody tests, seroprevalence was high for EHV-9 (60% of 45), moderate for EAV (24% of 51), and lower for the EHV-1-related zebra isolate (17% of 41), EHV-1 (14% of 49), and EHV-4 (2% of 50). No evidence for exposure to EHV-2 was found (0% of 51). The high level of exposure to EHV-9 is interesting because evidence of infection with this virus has not been previously described in any wild equine population. Although the epidemiology of EHV-9 in Burchell's zebras is presently unknown, our results suggest that in East Africa, this species may be a natural host of EHV-9, a neuropathogenic virus that was only recently isolated from captive Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsoni) in Japan. There is currently no evidence that EHV-9 induced mortality in Burchell's zebras in the Serengeti, but because of the reported virulence of this virus for more susceptible species such as Thomson's gazelles, viral transmission from infected zebras to ungulates may result in mortality.

      DNA of a new papillomavirus type was cloned from a cervical carcinoma biopsy. Two EcoRI clones of 7.8 and 6.9 kb in length were obtained, the latter contained a 900-bp deletion. The BamHI fragments of both clones were used to characterize the DNA. It represents a distinct type of papillomavirus as determined by its size, its cross-hybridization with DNA of other papillomavirus types under conditions of low stringency only, the co-linear alignment of its genome with HPV 6 and HPV 16 prototypes and its occasional occurrence as oligomeric episomes. We tentatively propose to designate it as HPV 18. DNA hybridizing with HPV 18 under stringent conditions was detected in 9/36 cervical carcinomas from Africa and Brazil, in 2/13 cervical tumors from Germany and 1/10 penile carcinomas. Benign tumors (17 cervical dysplasias, 29 genital warts), eight carcinomata in situ and 15 biopsies of normal cervical tissue were devoid of detectable HPV 18 DNA. HPV 18-related DNA was found, however, in cells of the HeLa, KB and C4-1 lines all derived from cervical cancer. The state of the viral DNA was investigated in four cervical cancer biopsies. The data reveal that the DNA might be integrated into the host cell genome. One tumor provided evidence for head to tail tandem repeats some of which persisted as circular episomes.

      Three patients who lived in south-eastern Australia and who suffered acute polyarticular illnesses in the summer months of 1983-1984 and 1984-1985 are described. Two patients lived in the southwestern plains of New South Wales and one in Bairnsdale in eastern Victoria. Serological studies implicated Kokobera virus, a flavivirus, as the likely causative agent. This would appear to be the first report to indicate the pathogenicity of Kokobera virus.

      Menangle virus (MenV), isolated in August 1997 following an outbreak of reproductive disease in a piggery in New South Wales, is the second previously unclassified member of the family Paramyxoviridae to be identified in Australia since 1994. Similar to Hendra virus (HeV), MenV appears to be a virus of fruit bats (flying foxes) in the genus Pteropus. No serological cross-reactivity was detected between MenV and other known paramyxoviruses and to facilitate virus classification a cDNA subtraction method was used to obtain viral-specific cDNA from MenV-infected cells. Cloning and sequencing of the products enabled the entire sequences of the NP, P/V, M, F, and HN genes to be determined. Comparison of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for each gene with members of the family Paramyxoviridae, determination of the P gene mRNA editing strategy, and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that MenV is a new member of the genus Rubulavirus. However the deduced protein sequence of MenV HN exhibited only limited sequence homology when compared with attachment proteins of other paramyxoviruses. Key differences within the amino acid residues considered important determinants of neuraminidase activity suggest MenV HN is unlikely to possess the same degree of neuraminidase activity characteristic of other rubulavirus and respirovirus HN proteins.

      Cross-species transmission of simian foamy virus (SFV) to human beings from chimpanzees, baboons, and African green monkeys has been described. Although macaques are the non-human primate most often handled in research, human infection with SFV from macaques has not been reported. Two of 46 primate-facility workers tested positive for antibodies that reacted with an immunoblot that contained macaque foamy virus antigens. Phylogenetic assessment of a 96-bp fragment of amplified proviral DNA isolated from peripheral-blood mononuclear cells from one infected individual was consistent with SFV infection of macaque origin. Frequent use of macaques in biomedical research, and identification of persistent retroviral infection from macaques to human beings, could have implications for public-health policy and occupational health and safety.

      In northwestern Australia, the flavivirus Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) poses a significant health risk to infants in some aboriginal communities, particularly during each wet season. While there are too few cases to warrant the development of a vaccine against MVE, a safe, effective prophylaxis for these children is still urgently required. The use of passive transfer of human gamma globulin to MVE or immunisation with a vaccine to the closely related Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus were investigated as potential strategies. When 40 microg of IgG was purified from MVE-immune human sera and transferred to 3-week-old mice, the animals were protected from lethal IP inoculation with MVE virus while still producing a detectable immune response to the virus. Similarly, sera from adult mice infected sublethally with MVE or JE virus provided significant protection against MVE infection. However, sera from mice sublethally infected with the related Kunjin or immunised with the inactivated JE vaccine (Biken) provided no protection against MVE challenge. In fact, mice immunised passively with the latter appeared to succumb to MVE challenge more rapidly than mice that received serum from unimmunised animals, suggesting that antibody to the vaccine had accelerated the progression of disease. These preliminary trials in mice indicate that passive immunisation with human gamma globulin has the greatest potential as a strategy for MVE prophylaxis, whilst the apparent enhancement of MVE by antibodies to the JE vaccine requires further investigation, with particular reference to current vaccination programs in areas of Australia and Papua New Guinea, where both JE and MVE occur.

      Orungo and Lebombo orbivirus isolates were examined for their intra- and intergroup genetic relatedness by blot hybridization and gene reassortment; blot hybridization was also used to examine the relatedness of selected Orungo and Lebombo isolates to known orbiviruses. Among the Orungo isolates, greater than 74% sequence similarity was shown in the majority of their genes. Gene 2 was the most divergent gene, with four unique types identified, and genes 5, 6 and 10 were variant among the isolates. Plaque reduction neutralization tests revealed at least four serotypes, a result which correlated with the hybridization data. Gene reassortment was shown between two representative Orungo isolates. Among the Lebombo isolates, two hybridization types were identified between which gene reassortment was demonstrated. Unique genes were not shown, whereas genes 2, 5 and 10 exhibited minor sequence variability. Geographic distribution correlated with relatedness among the Lebombo isolates, which was not the case among the Orungo isolates. Orungo and Lebombo viruses did not cross-hybridize or reassort their genes in vitro, in intergroup studies. In blot hybridization tests of Orungo and Lebombo isolates with known orbivirus serogroups and ungrouped orbiviruses, no strong cross-hybridization was seen. These results demonstrate that Orungo and Lebombo are distinct from each other and from other orbiviruses, and should therefore be recognized as two new Orbivirus serogroups.

      Two previously unknown and distinct herpesviruses were isolated from donkeys. One, with the characteristics of a betaherpesvirus, was isolated from the leukocytes of an apparently healthy donkey, while the second, an alphaherpesvirus, was recovered from the nasal cavity of donkeys given high doses of corticosteroids, and caused rhinitis in two seronegative weanling donkeys when they were intranasally infected. Few, if any, restriction endonuclease fragments were shared by the donkey betaherpesvirus, equine herpesvirus 2 (EHV 2) or EHV 5, a second distinctly different equine betaherpesvirus, nor by the donkey alphaherpesvirus, EHV 1, EHV 4, or EHV 3. In Southern blot analysis the donkey betaherpesvirus showed low levels of sequence similarity to both EHV 2 and EHV 5, while the donkey alphaherpesvirus and EHV 1 shared a moderate degree of sequence similarity, less similarity with EHV 4 and very low level of sequence similarity with EHV 3. These two isolates appear prototypic of two previously unrecorded herpesviruses for which the names asinine herpesvirus 2 and 3 are suggested for the betaherpesvirus and the alphaherpesvirus respectively.

      The dramatic decline of the native red squirrel in the UK has been attributed to both direct and disease-mediated competition with the grey squirrel where the competitor acts as a reservoir host of squirrelpox virus (SQPV). SQPV is threatening red squirrel conservation efforts, yet little is known about its epidemiology. We analysed seroprevalence of antibody against SQPV in grey squirrels from northern England and the Scottish Borders in relation to season, weather, sex, and body weight using Generalized Linear Models in conjunction with Structural Equation Modelling. Results indicated a heterogeneous prevalence pattern which is male-biased, increases with weight and varies seasonally. Seroprevalence rose during the autumn and peaked in spring. Weather parameters had an indirect effect on SQPV antibody status. Our findings point towards a direct disease transmission route, which includes environmental contamination. Red squirrel conservation management options should therefore seek to minimize squirrel contact points.

      In 8 of 10 wild rats trapped in The Netherlands, an infectious viruslike agent was isolated predominantly from the salivary glands and could be serially passed in laboratory rats. In rat embryo cells a typical cytomegalo-like cytopathic effect was produced. The morphologic and cultural characteristics of the isolated agent were comparable with those of the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). The virus-nucleocapsid had a size of 92 nm and was not ether-resistant. The extracellular nucleocapsids were often enclosed by an outer layer of very variable shape and size. The formation of Fc receptors on cells infected with the rat virus could be demonstrated. The wild rats possessed neutralizing antibodies to the isolated agent. The rat agent grew only in rat embryo fibroblast cells while MCMV grew in rat and mouse embryo cells. The rat agent gave plaques in REF monolayers. Electron microscope studies showed the presence of nucleocapsids in the nucleus.

      Strain 13 guinea pigs inoculated subcutaneously with Pichinde virus developed fever, lost body weight, decreased water and food consumption, and died at 14 +/- 0.6 days. After FPL-55712, a leukotriene D4 antagonist, was administered beginning on PID (post-inoculation day) 3 for 18 days, the magnitude of body weight loss decreased and food intake increased, despite a persistent fever. The treated guinea pigs also survived significantly longer than infected animals receiving placebo injection (21 vs 14 days). Using guinea pig ileum bioassay and radioimmunoassay, we detected significant levels of plasma leukotrienes in Pichinde virus-infected guinea pigs on PID 11 and possibly PID 14. These findings strongly suggest that leukotrienes play a role in the pathogenesis of arenavirus infection and may account in part for the observed cardiac depression, pulmonary edema, and eventual death.

      We report the isolation of St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE) virus from a mature male killer whale (Orcinus orca). This represents the first isolation of SLE virus from a marine mammal. The animal presented with reduced appetite, rapidly became lethargic and subsequently died. Virus-induced CPE was observed in a dolphin cell line, SP-1K (ATCC CCL 78), inoculated with brain, kidney, and lung tissues obtained at necropsy. Electron microscopy of infected SP-1K cells revealed the presence of virions having morphology and size resembling members of the Flaviviridae. Final identification as SLE virus was made by neutralization and immunofluorescence staining tests.

      Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is an oncogenic retrovirus that commonly infects cattle and causes B cell leukosis in 1-5% of infected cattle. BLV-infected cells are present in marketed beef and dairy products. In the decade after the discovery of BLV in 1969, studies using agar gel immunodiffusion and complement fixation assays failed to find antibodies to BLV in human sera. This led to the prevailing opinion that exposure of humans to BLV and/or the potential for infection are not significant and therefore the virus is not a public health hazard. We reexamined this issue using more sensitive immunological techniques available today. Using immunoblotting to test the sera of 257 humans for antibodies of four isotypes (IgG1, IgM, IgA, and IgG4) to the BLV capsid antigen (p24), we detected at least one antibody isotype reactive with BLV in 74% of the human sera tested. The specificity of the reactivity was strongly suggested by competition studies and by ruling out cross-reacting antibodies to other chronic human viruses. Our results suggest that antibodies reactive with the BLV capsid antigen may serve as a biomarker for exposure to BLV and this exposure may be widespread. The results do not necessarily mean that humans are actually infected with BLV; the antibodies could be a response to heat-denatured BLV antigens consumed in food. They do, however, suggest that further studies in this area could be important.

      In previous studies, human hepatitis viruses have been experimentally transmitted to New World monkeys of the genus Saguinus (tamarins). Recently, two Flaviviridae-like agents (GBV-A and GBV-B) were identified in tamarins that developed hepatitis following inoculation with serum of the 11th tamarin passage of a potentially new human hepatitis agent. However, it was not shown that these viruses originated from the initial inoculum. We here report the discovery of indigenous species-specific viruses related to GBV-A in several species of New World monkeys and suggest that GBV-A virus was fortuitously acquired during passage in tamarins. Sera or plasma from 98 wild-caught New World monkeys representing 10 different species was tested by RT-PCR with conserved degenerate primers to the 5' noncoding region of the genome. Viral sequences were identified in 33 animals and sequence analysis was performed on the amplicons. In addition, the genomic region corresponding to the putative NS3 RNA helicase of GBV-A was amplified from most positive animals and sequenced. We detected GBV-A-like viruses in 13 (35%) of 37 S. mystax, 7 (78%) of 9 S. nigricollis, 3 (25%) of 12 S. labiatus, 2 (50%) of 4 S. oedipus, 2 (100%) of 2 Callithrix jacchus, and 6 (50%) of 12 Aotus trivirgatus monkeys. Each positive animal was infected with a unique strain of the GBV-A-like viruses. Analysis of the 5' NC and NS3 helicase sequences revealed that these viruses could be classified into 5 major genetic groups with genetic distances equivalent to or greater than those found among major genetic groups of hepatitis C virus. Species-specific GBV-A-like viruses were found in S. mystax, S. nigricollis, S. oedipus, C. jacchus, and A. trivirgatus species. The viruses specific for S. nigricollis were closely related to GBV-A, suggesting that GBV-A was acquired by passage through this species during the initial transmission studies. The natural history of the GBV-A-like viruses was studied in serial serum samples from 9 S. mystax and 2 A. trivirgatus monkeys. Each animal was chronically infected and the viral strain did not vary during 9-27 months of follow-up. Finally, we demonstrated that four S. mystax were positive upon arrival to the United States from the country of origin. No apparent disease was associated with chronic infection of the GBV-A-like viruses. In conclusion, many New World monkeys are persistently infected with indigenous species-specific viruses that may represent a new genus within the virus family Flaviviridae.

      GB virus-B (GBV-B) is a member of the Flaviviridae family of viruses. This RNA virus causes acute resolving hepatitis in experimentally infected tamarins, but its natural host remains unknown. GBV-B and a related virus, GBV-A, were recovered from serum containing the ""GB agent,"" which was believed to have originated from a surgeon (initials: GB) with acute hepatitis. GBV-B has special interest because it is the virus related most closely to hepatitis C virus, which is an important cause of acute and chronic liver disease in humans. In the present study, we found that the host range of GBV-B includes owl monkeys. Tamarins and owl monkeys belong to two different families of New World monkeys. The natural history of GBV-B in the two owl monkeys studied was similar to that previously found for tamarins and was characterized by early appearance of viremia and viral clearance. However, the peak viral titers of GBV-B observed in owl monkeys (10(5) genome equivalents [GE] /ml) were lower than those observed in experimentally infected tamarins (10(7)-10(8) GE/ml) and acute hepatitis was observed in only one animal. If GBV-B were indeed a virus of humans, it would be expected to infect chimpanzees, a surrogate of humans, because all recognized human hepatitis viruses are transmissible to chimpanzees and cause hepatitis. However, in the present study, we failed to transmit GBV-B to a naive chimpanzee. In addition, a second naive chimpanzee transfected intrahepatically with RNA transcripts from an infectious clone of GBV-B did not become infected. Thus, chimpanzees are apparently not susceptible to GBV-B. Finally, we failed to detect GBV-B in acute-phase serum from surgeon GB. Our data suggest that GBV-B is not a human virus and that GBV-B, like GBV-A, is a virus of New World monkeys.

      A blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to test 97 serum samples from big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) captured in six counties in Illinois between May 2002 and February 2004 for West Nile virus (WNV) antibodies. One female big brown bat tested positive for WNV antibodies. Samples of kidney, liver, and heart tissue were collected from 312 bats of seven species that were submitted to the Illinois (USA) Department of Public Health or the Illinois Department of Agriculture diagnostic laboratories between January 2001 and December 2003. Tissue samples were tested for WNV using TaqMan reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and all were negative. Prevalence of WNV antibodies in the bats (1%) was lower than previously reported for other flaviviruses, but similar to the prevalence (2%) of WNV antibodies reported in bats from New Jersey and New York, USA. Additional research is needed to determine potential impact of WNV infections on bats and to determine whether they play a role in the WNV transmission cycle.

      In the course of investigating suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever in South Africa patients were encountered who had been bitten by ticks, but who lacked evidence of infection with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus or non-viral tick-borne agents. Cattle sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunoassay to determine whether tick-borne viruses other than CCHF occur in the country. The prevalence of antibody in cattle sera was 905/2116 (42.8%) for CCHF virus, 70/1358 (5.2%) for Dugbe, 21/1358 (1.5%) for louping ill, 6/450 (1.3%) for West Nile, 7/1358 (0.5%) for Nairobi sheep disease, 3/625 (0.5%) for Kadam and 2/450 (0.4%) for Chenuda. No reactions were recorded with Hazara, Bahig, Bhanja, Thogoto and Dhori viruses. The CCHF findings confirmed previous observations that the virus is widely prevalent within the distribution range of ticks of the genus Hyalomma, while antibody activity to Dugbe antigen was detected only within the distribution range of the tick Amblyomma hebraeum. Cross-reactivity for the nairoviruses, Hazara, Nairobi sheep disease and Dugbe, was detected in serum samples from 3/72 human patients with confirmed CCHF infection, and serum from 1/162 other patients reacted monospecifically with Dugbe antigen. The latter patient suffered from febrile illness with prolonged thrombocytopenia.

      In 1978-1991 the USSR-Guinea Virological and Microbiological Laboratory functioned in Kindia, the Republic of Guinea. Arbovirus activity in this country was studied by a number of virologists and other specialists. Their personal contribution and achievements in this collaboration are reflected in the present paper. About 74,000 mosquitoes, 100,000 Ixodidae ticks, 1,500 wild birds, 2,700 bats, 106 monkeys, and 308 other mammals, 927 blood samples collected from febrile patients were examined in 1978-1989, using inoculation of new-born white mice. As a result of this work 127 strains of the following arboviruses were isolated: Chikungunia (1 strain), Dengue 2 (4), Saboya (7), Wesselsbron (1), Bunyamwera (4), M'Poko (5), Rift Valley Fever (6), CHF-Congo (9), Dugbe (22), Bhanja (6), Forecariah (2), Jos (26), Abadina (15), Kindia (2), Ark 6956 (1), Fomede (2), Bluetongue (9), Mossuril (2), AnK 6009 (1), and Kolente (2). Dengue 2, Wesselsbron, Bunyamwera, M'Poko, Kindia, Mossuril viruses were isolated from mosquitoes. Ixodidae ticks were sources for isolation of Chikungunia, Saboya, CCHF, Dugbe, Bhanja, Forecaciah, Jos, Abadina, Kindia, Ark 6956, Fomede, Bluetongue, and Kolente viruses. Saboya, RVF, Fomede, Kolente, AnK 6909 were isolated from bats (Chiroptera); Saboya, Abadina, and Bluetongue viruses from birds. One strain of Dugbe virus was originated from the brain of Cercopithecus patas. Bunyamwera and Abadina viruses were isolated from the blood of two febrile patients. Serological identification of many strains was kindly conducted at the Pasteur Institute, Dakar (J. P.Digoutte) and some at the YARU, USA (R. Shope). Kindia and Ark 6956 (Reovirus, gr. Palyam), Fomede (gr. Chobar Gorge), Forecariah (Bunyavirus, gr. Bhanja), Kolente (Rhabdovirus) were identified as an original type of Lagos bat virus. The results of seroepidemiological surveys are also presented.

      To determine the incidence of rotavirus infection among dairy herds in the State of São Paulo, Brazil, 576 faecal samples obtained from calves aged 1-45 days with and without diarrhoea, reared on 63 dairy cattle farms, were analyzed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) identified 28 samples positive for group A rotavirus, while four samples, two diarrhoeic and two non-diarrhoeic, showed a bisegmented genome with a typical picobirnavirus pattern. Electron microscopy revealed spherical virus particles with a diameter of 37 nm and without a defined surface structure. The present study is the first report of a bisegmented virus identified in cattle in Brazil.

      Porcine parvovirus (PPV) is widespread among swine and is responsible for reproductive failure of susceptible sows, characterized by embryonic and fetal death. Studies showed that PPV in domestic pig is genetically diverse and some strains differ from the ones used for vaccination. Organ samples from wild boars and domestic pigs were collected in Transylvania (Romania) and tested for the presence of PPV by polymerase chain reaction. Positive samples were grouped and 14 from the wild boar and 1 from the domestic pig PPVs were selected for VP1/VP2 sequence analysis and comparison with available GenBank data. The molecular clock analysis revealed that PPV has a relatively recent evolutionary history, originated approximately 120 years ago and the main divergence occurred in the last 20-60 years. Phylogenetic and residue substitution analysis showed that the viruses could be divided into 6 distinct clusters and that wild boar PPVs were partially different and independent from domestic pig PPVs. PPVs of wild boars proved to be more diverse than viruses of domestic pigs. The presence of the highly virulent 27a-like PPV strains in wild boars was also detected.

      Of more than 500 arboviruses recognized worldwide, 5 were first isolated in Canada and 58 were first isolated in the United States. Six of these viruses are human pathogens: western equine encephalitis (WEE) and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and Powassan (POW) viruses (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), LaCrosse (LAC) virus (Bunyaviridae, Bunyavirus), and Colorado tick fever (CTF) virus (Reoviridae, Coltivirus). Their scientific histories, geographic distributions, virology, epidemiology, vectors, vertebrate hosts, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical and differential diagnoses, control, treatment, and laboratory diagnosis are reviewed. In addition, mention is made of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), which periodically cause human and equine disease in North America. WEE, EEE, and SLE viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes between birds; POW and CTF viruses, between wild mammals by ticks; LAC virus, between small mammals by mosquitoes; and VEE viruses, between small or large mammals by mosquitoes. Human infections are tangential to the natural cycle. Such infections range from rare to focal but are relatively frequent where they occur. Epidemics of WEE, EEE, VEE, and SLE viruses have been recorded at periodic intervals, but prevalence of infections with LAC and CTF viruses typically are constant, related to the degree of exposure to infected vectors. Infections with POW virus appear to be rare. Adequate diagnostic tools are available, but treatment is mainly supportive, and greater efforts at educating the public and the medical community are suggested if infections are to be prevented.

      Bats (order Chiroptera, suborders Megachiroptera [""flying foxes""] and Microchiroptera) are abundant, diverse, and geographically widespread. These mammals provide us with resources, but their importance is minimized and many of their populations and species are at risk, even threatened or endangered. Some of their characteristics (food choices, colonial or solitary nature, population structure, ability to fly, seasonal migration and daily movement patterns, torpor and hibernation, life span, roosting behaviors, ability to echolocate, virus susceptibility) make them exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents. Bats of certain species are well recognized as being capable of transmitting rabies virus, but recent observations of outbreaks and epidemics of newly recognized human and livestock diseases caused by viruses transmitted by various megachiropteran and microchiropteran bats have drawn attention anew to these remarkable mammals. This paper summarizes information regarding chiropteran characteristics and information regarding 66 viruses that have been isolated from bats. From these summaries, it is clear that we do not know enough about bat biology; we are doing too little in terms of bat conservation; and there remain a multitude of questions regarding the role of bats in disease emergence.

      Sera from horses and human beings with clinically diagnosed western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus infections were tested for hemagglutination-inhibition (HI), complement-fixation (CF), and neutralizing (N) antibody to WEE virus. These tests confirmed infection in 43.8% (HI), 56.3% (CF), and 80.4% (N) of horses and 54.5% (HI), 59.1% (CF), and 77.3% (N) of human beings. Use of the N test as an adjunct to the HI and CF tests increased the likelihood of serologic confirmation to 91.7%. In both horses and human beings, N antibody increased steeply at the end of the 1st week after onset. The results suggested that the presence of a high HI, CF, and/or N antibody titer in a single serum obtained from horses during the acute phase of illness caused by WEE virus can be used as presumptive evidence for infection with this virus.

      We attempted to tabulate all Bunyamwera serogroup (family Bunyaviridae, genus Bunyavirus) isolates from North America. By summarizing information from the laboratories of the Centers for Disease Control, data generously shared by other laboratories, and the published literature, we were able to accumulate data regarding 1,372 Bunyamwera serogroup viruses. These were: Tensaw (664, including 8 from vertebrates), Cache Valley (396, including 6 from vertebrates), Main Drain (160, including 14 from vertebrates), Lokern (69, including 8 from vertebrates), Northway (13, including 5 from vertebrates), Tlacotalpan (7), Santa Rosa (2), Santa Cruz (1 from a horse), and 60 of undetermined serotype. Virus isolation rates by month of collection were correlated with collection efforts, but associations of viruses and arthropod vectors varied by location, vertebrate host, and arthropod distribution. Tensaw virus was isolated principally from Anopheles crucians mosquitoes (466/656 isolates from arthropods) in the southeastern United States; Cache Valley virus principally from An. quadrimaculatus (94), Coquillettidia perturbans (59), Culiseta inornata (45), Aedes sollicitans (30), Psorophora columbiae (23), An. punctipennis (18), and Ae. vexans and trivittatus (18 each) mosquitoes (total = 305/382 isolates from arthropods from all of the United States and Canada, except the southeastern United States); Main Drain virus from Culicoides variipennis (31), Culicoides (Selfia) sp. (65), and Psorophora (23) and Aedes (21) species mosquitoes in the western United States; Lokern virus from Culicoides species (55/61 isolates from arthropods) in the western United States. Relationships between vector and vertebrate host distributions are discussed briefly in regard to geographic distribution of the Bunyamwera serogroup viruses.

Tensaw virus was isolated principally from Anopheles crucians mosquitoes (466/656 isolates from arthropods) in the southeastern United States; Cache Valley virus principally from An. quadrimaculatus (94), Coquillettidia perturbans (59), Culiseta inornata (45), Aedes sollicitans (30), Psorophora columbiae (23), An. punctipennis (18), and Ae. vexans and trivittatus (18 each) mosquitoes (total = 305/382 isolates from arthropods from all of the United States and Canada, except the southeastern United States); Main Drain virus from Culicoides variipennis (31), Culicoides (Selfia) sp. (65), and Psorophora (23) and Aedes (21) species mosquitoes in the western United States; Lokern virus from Culicoides species (55/61 isolates from arthropods) in the western United States. Relationships between vector and vertebrate host distributions are discussed briefly in regard to geographic distribution of the Bunyamwera serogroup viruses.

      Two strains of recently isolated Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex virus from southern Brazil, avirulent for 6- to 8-week-old mice and short-haired guinea pigs, were characterized by biologic, serologic, and biochemical means. They were shown serologically to represent a single, newly recognized variant of subtype I. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of ribonuclease T1 digests of viral ribonucleic acid showed considerable homology between the genomes of the new variant prototype and variant IA. Three structural proteins were visualized by discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE (SDS-PAGE). Although the smallest protein of both recent isolates migrates with the capsid proteins of other subtype I viruses, the larger structural proteins of the new variants differ in molecular weight from the E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins of the other subtype I variants. The new isolates produced peptide fragment patterns that were identical to each other, but different from the patterns of other subtype I viruses, following SDS-PaGE of dissociated virions digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease. Since these two isolates were from Culex (Melanoconion) species mosquitoes and from a bat (Carollia perspicillata), were postulated that this is an enzootic VEE virus variant for which the classification IF is suggested.

      Serum or heparinized plasma samples were obtained between 1994 and 1996 from 20 male and 20 female adult free-ranging Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) from St. Lawrence Island and Round Island, Alaska. Samples were screened for antibodies to some potentially pathogenic bacteria and viruses. No sample had detectable antibody to Brucella spp. Three of 40 (8%) had low antibody titers to Leptospira interrogans serovars. Phocine distemper virus antibodies were not detected. Serologic responses to one or more caliciviruses (San Miguel sea lion virus 12 or vesicular exanthema of swine serotypes E54, F55, G55, 1934B) were detected in 18% (seven of 40) walrus. Antibodies to one or more subtypes of influenza A virus (H10, N2, N3, N5, N6, N7) were detected in 21% (eight of 38). Periodic screening of free-ranging populations for exposure to infectious diseases has become an important component of bio-monitoring programs to facilitate understanding and detecting trends in marine mammal populations.

      To explore the involvement of the simian polyomavirus SV40 in human colon cancer, a molecular case-control study was undertaken in patients and in their relatives living in an area where the spread of SV40 has already been documented. From 2006 to 2008, 94 colon cancer patients (age: 37-90 years) and 91 subjects (age: 32-70 years) relatives of each index case were enrolled. A blood sample and a specimen of cancer tissue or biopsy were collected, from each patient or control, respectively. Samples were analyzed twice for Polyomavirus (i.e., SV40, JCV, and BKV) by PCR and by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) with reproducible results. No BKV/JCV was detected either in normal or pathological tissues. SV40 was not present in control subjects, either normal tissue or in biopsies from adenomas or polyps. All blood samples were negative. Conversely, six adenocarcinoma specimens were positive for SV40 sequences (overall prevalence 6.4%, P = 0.03 in comparison with controls). Nevertheless, the SV40-associated colon cancer risk proved statistically not significant (OR = 3.91; P = 0.115) when adjusted for age. Quantitation of SV40 DNA performed by RT-qPCR showed a low viral load ranging from 6.2 x 10(1) to 9 x 10(3) copies per reaction. This molecular case-control survey showed, for the first time in fresh samples and by RT-qPCR, that SV40 can be detected in colon cancer tissue. However, the finding was not statistically significant when compared with a well-structured community control group. Thus, the role of SV40 and other polyomavirus in colon cancer genesis deserves further investigation.

      A fatal Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection epidemic involving fifteen primates occurred between October 2006 and February 2007 at the Natura Viva Zoo. This large open-field zoo park located near Lake Garda in Northern Italy hosts one thousand animals belonging to one hundred and fifty different species, including various lemur species. This lemur collection is the most relevant and rich in Italy. A second outbreak between September and November 2008 involved three lemurs. In all cases, the clinical signs were sudden deaths generally without any evident symptoms or only with mild unspecific clinical signs. Gross pathologic changes were characterized by myocarditis (diffuse or focal pallor of the myocardium), pulmonary congestion, emphysema, oedema and thoracic fluid. The EMCV was isolated and recognized as the causative agent of both outbreaks. The first outbreak in particular was associated with a rodent plague, confirming that rats are an important risk factor for the occurrence of the EMCV infection.

      The application of molecular diagnostic techniques along with nucleotide sequence determination to permit contemporary phylogenetic analysis of European field isolates of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) has not been widely reported. As a result, of extensive testing instigated following the 2006 outbreak of equine infectious anemia in Italy, 24 farms with a history of exposure to this disease were included in this study. New PCR-based methods were developed, which, especially in the case of DNA preparations from peripheral blood cells, showed excellent correlation with OIE-approved agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) tests for identifying EIAV-infected animals. In contrast, the OIE-recommended oligonucleotide primers for EIAV failed to react with any of the Italian isolates. Similar results were also obtained with samples from four Romanian farms. In addition, for the first time complete characterization of gag genes from five Italian isolates and one Romanian isolate has been achieved, along with acquisition of extensive sequence information (86% of the total gag gene) from four additional EIAV isolates (one Italian and three Romanian). Furthermore, in another 23 cases we accomplished partial characterization of gag gene sequences in the region encoding the viral matrix protein. Analysis of this information suggested that most Italian isolates were geographically restricted, somewhat reminiscent of the ""clades"" described for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Collectively this represents the most comprehensive genetic study of European EIAV isolates conducted to date.

      The current article describes outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis (VS) in horses and cattle in Paraiba and Rio Grande do Norte states, northeastern Brazil, between June and August 2013. The reported cases affected 15-20 horses and 6 cattle distributed over 6 small farms in 4 municipalities, but additional data indicated the involvement of a large number of animals on several farms. The disease was characterized by blisters; eruptive lesions in coronary bands, lips, mouth, and muzzle; salivation; claudication and loss of condition. Swollen lower limbs and lips, and ulcerated and erosive areas in the lips and muzzle were observed in some horses. A necrotizing vesiculopustular dermatitis and stomatitis was observed histologically. Vesicular stomatitis virus was isolated from the vesicular fluid of a horse lesion and shown to be serologically related to the VS Indiana serogroup (VSIV) by virus neutralization. Convalescent sera of affected horses and cattle, and from healthy contacts, harbored high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the isolated virus (named VSIV-3 2013SaoBento/ParaibaE). Genomic sequences of VSIV subtype 3 (Vesicular stomatitis Alagoas virus) were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction out of clinical specimens from a cow and a horse from different farms. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the phosphoprotein gene indicated that the 2 isolates were derived from the same virus and clustered them in VSIV-3, along with VS viruses identified in southeastern and northeastern Brazil in the last decades. Thus, the present report demonstrates the circulation of VSIV-3 in northeastern Brazil and urges for more effective diagnosis and surveillance.

      An alpaca herd in eastern Ontario experienced vague signs of illness, including anorexia and lethargy in 9 animals, 2.5 months after the addition of a chronically ill cria and his dam to the farm. Subsequently 2 alpaca had early pregnancy loss; one aborted at 5.5 months gestation and the other at 7 months gestation. Seventeen were found to have serum antibody to bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), with highest titers to BVDV type 1. The fetus that was aborted at 5.5 months gestation, 3 months after the clinical outbreak, was found to be positive for BVDV on immunohistochemical staining, and noncytopathic BVDV type 1b was isolated. Of the 13 cria born alive that season, a single male underweight alpaca cria, born 9 months after the clinical illnesses, was infected with BVDV type 1b. The cria was positive for BVDV at birth, at 3 and 26 days of age and continued to be positive for noncytopathic BVDV using virus isolation, nested reverse transcription PCR, antigen detection ELISA, and immunohistochemical staining until euthanasia at 46 days of age. The cria remained serum antibody negative to both BVDV type 1 and type 2. A diagnosis of persistent infection was made. This is the first report describing persistent infection with BVDV in an alpaca cria.

      Thirty-eight samples of Rabies Virus isolated from dogs and crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) in Northeastern Brazil were characterized genetically by analyzing the G gene and the psi region. The results show that there are two groups of Rabies Virus lineages circulating among domestic and wild animals in the region. The topologies of the phylogenetic trees of the G gene and psi region are similar and reveal the existence of geographic groups. The genetic diversity of the lineages isolated from wild animals (wild group) was approximately twice that of the lineages isolated from domestic animals (domestic group), and the genetic distance between the two groups was 9.93%. Polymorphism analysis revealed specific intra- and inter-group molecular signatures for both the G gene and psi region. Together with the analysis of the N gene undertaken previously, the results of this study confirm the existence of a Rabies Virus phylogroup in Northeastern Brazil (NB) circulating in the C. thous population, making this species a rabies biotype in the region.

      In August 2002, two cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) were confirmed in Mineros and Concepcion, within the Santa Cruz Department of Bolivia. Extensive alteration of the native ecosystem, from dense forest to pasture or sugarcane, had occurred in both regions. An ecologic assessment of reservoir species associated with the human disease identified a single hantavirus antibody-positive Oligoryzomys microtis from Mineros and three hantavirus antibody-positive Calomys callosus from Concepcion. In Mineros, the virus from the O. microtis was 90% similar to sequences published for Rio Mamore virus. Viral nucleotide sequences from two C. callosus were 87-88% similar to the sequence of Laguna Negra virus. The viral sequence from the C. callosus was 99% identical to viral sequences obtained from the HPS patient in this area, implicating C. callosus as the host and Laguna Negra virus as the agent responsible for the HPS case near Concepcion.

      The Brazilian chiropteran fauna consists of 167 species; of which, three are hematophagous: the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), the white-winged vampire bat (Diaemus youngi), and the hairy-legged vampire bat (Diphylla ecaudata). The aim of this study was to describe the isolation of Rabies virus from common and hairy-legged vampire bats and to report the first comparative antigenic and genetic studies of isolates from these bats. Antigenic and genetic typing of both isolates identified them as antigenic variant 3 (AgV3), the variant frequently isolated from common vampire bats. Phylogenetic analysis showed 99.3% identity between the isolates. This is the first time since 1934 that Rabies virus has been isolated from hairy-legged vampire bats in Brazil. Our analysis provides evidence that the existence of rabies-positive isolates from hairy-legged vampire bats may be the result of an interspecific rabies transmission event from common vampire bats and suggests that roost cohabitation may occur.

      Although the main transmitters of rabies in Brazil are dogs and vampire bats, the role of other species such as insectivorous and frugivorous bats deserves special attention, as the rabies virus has been isolated from 36 bat species. This study describes the first isolation of the rabies virus from the insectivorous bat Eumops perotis. The infected animal was found in the city of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo. The virus was identified by immunofluorescence antibody test (FAT) in central nervous system (CNS) samples, and the isolation was carried out in N2A cell culture and adult mice. The sample was submitted to antigenic typing using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CDC/Atlanta/USA). The DNA sequence of the nucleoprotein gene located between nucleotides 102 and 1385 was aligned with homologous sequences from GenBank using the CLUSTAL/W method, and the alignment was used to build a neighbor-joining distance-based phylogenetic tree with the K-2-P model. CNS was negative by FAT, and only one mouse died after inoculation with a suspension from the bat's CNS. Antigenic typing gave a result that was not compatible with the patterns defined by the panel. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus isolated segregated into the same cluster related to other viruses isolated from insectivorous bats belonging to genus Nyctinomops ssp. (98.8% nucleotide identity with each other).

      Sequence analysis of part of the fusion protein gene from recent isolates of rinderpest virus revealed that distinct lineages of the virus exist which reflect the geographical location of their isolation in Africa and Asia. Current strains circulating in Kenya and Sudan were most similar, both in terms of nucleotide sequence and pathogenic nature, to viruses isolated in Egypt and in Nigeria in 1983/1984 and they were quite distinct from an East African isolate (RBT-1) from the 1960s. Two older isolates of the virus, the Japanese avianized/lapinized vaccine strain dating from the 1930s and the Old Kabete strain dating from 1911, each differed considerably from the other viruses. The sequence data were derived from the region where the precursor protein is cleaved to yield the biologically active F1/F2 heterodimer; all strains analysed had a highly basic connecting peptide which is required for efficient cleavage by endogenous host cell proteases. No correlation was found between amino acid changes at this site and the rinderpest virus pathogenicity unlike the association reported for Newcastle disease virus.

      We are studying the diversity of and relationships among papillomaviruses (PVs) to understand the modes and timescales of PV evolution and in the hope of finding animal PVs that may serve as model systems for disease caused by human PVs (HPVs). Toward this goal, we have examined 326 genital samples from rhesus monkeys and long-tailed macaques with a PCR protocol optimized for detecting genital HPV types. In 28 of the rhesus monkey samples, we found amplicons derived from 12 different and novel PV genomes, RhPV-a to RhPV-m, with the likely taxonomic status of ""type."" The frequency with which novel RhPVs were detected suggests that rhesus monkeys may play host to PVs with a diversity similar to that of humans. In phylogenetic trees, all 12 of the different RhPVs and the previously described type RhPV-1 were members of the genital HPV supergroup and formed three minor branches distinct from the 11 branches formed by genital HPVs. We also identified a novel PV amplicon, MfPV-a, from a long-tailed macaque, a species belonging to the same genus as rhesus monkeys. MfPV-a turned out to be a close relative of five RhPVs. It appears that the evolution of primate lineages leading to the genus Macaca and to humans created transmission barriers for PVs, resulting in viral evolution closely linked to the host. Additional support for the linked-evolution hypothesis comes from considering the phylogenetic association of two other ape and monkey PVs with the genital HPVs, the supergroup formed by at least seven ungulate PVs, and the isolated phylogenetic position of the only known bird PV.

      It is generally accepted that the reservoir hosts of cowpox virus are wild rodents, although direct evidence for this is lacking for much of the virus's geographic range. Here, through a combination of serology and PCR, we demonstrate conclusively that the main hosts in Great Britain are bank voles, wood mice and short-tailed field voles. However, we also suggest that wood mice may not be able to maintain infection alone, explaining the absence of cowpox from Ireland where voles are generally not found. Infection in wild rodents varies seasonally, and this variation probably underlies the marked seasonal incidence of infection in accidental hosts such as humans and domestic cats.

      We surveyed 12 populations of the montane water vole (Arvicola scherman), previously known as the fossorial form of the water vole A. terrestris, in eastern France for antibodies (immunoglobulin G) to Puumala virus (PUUV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and cowpox virus (CPXV). Antibodies to PUUV were found in 9 (5.5%) of 164 voles from 7 populations, antibodies to LCMV were found in 13 (26.0%) of 50 voles from 2 populations, and antibodies to CPXV were found in 66 (41.8%) of 158 voles from 7 populations. Antibody status to CPXV was statistically associated with the phase of the A. scherman population density cycle and the percentage of grassland areas surrounding the sampling sites.

      Previous studies suggested that the small genomic segments (S-RNA) of the South American arenaviruses (SA-AVs) represent three phylogenetic lineages (designated A, B, and C) and indicated that the S-RNA of Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV) (a North American arenavirus [NA-AV]) is a product of genetic recombination between a lineage A and lineage B virus. The purpose of this study was to extend our knowledge on the phylogenetic relationships between WWAV, the two other NA-AVs (Tamiami and bear canyon), and the 15 SA-AVs. Therefore, we determined the complete sequence of the S-RNA of nine arenaviruses previously uncharacterized or sequenced only partially. Phylogenetic analyses of the two complete coding regions indicated that the S-RNA of the three NA-AVs have descended from a single ancestral virus, which was the product of recombination between a lineage A and lineage B arenavirus. No such evidence for genetic recombination was found in cupixi virus (a novel arenavirus isolated from a wild rodent captured in Northeastern Brazil) or the 14 other SA-AVs. The recombinant nature of the S-RNA of NA-AVs distinguishes them from the SA-AVs, and thus, indicates that the NA-AVs represent a fourth phylogenetic lineage in the Tacaribe serocomplex.

      To date, the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses recognizes that the family Arenaviridae contains a unique genus Arenavirus that includes 22 viral species. There are nine additional arenaviruses that either have been discovered recently, or which taxonomic status remains pending. Arenaviruses have been classified according to their antigenic properties into two groups, the Lassa-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) serocomplex and the Tacaribe serocomplex which has been further divided into four evolutionary lineages. Each arenavirus is more or less tightly associated with a mammal host. The distribution of the host dictates the distribution of the virus. Humans may become infected by arenaviruses through direct contact with infected rodents, including bites, or through inhalation of infectious rodent excreta and secreta. Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Guanarito, and Sabia viruses are known to cause a severe hemorrhagic fever, in western Africa, Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Brazil, respectively. Infection by LCM virus can result in acute central nervous system disease, congenital malformations, and infection in organ transplantation recipients. Detection of arenaviruses in their animal host can be achieved by virus isolation, and has recently taken advantage of PCR-based techniques. The approach based on consensus degenerate primers has shown efficient for both detection of known arenaviruses, and discovery of new arenaviruses.

      The family Arenaviridae consists of a unique genus (Arenavirus) that currently comprises 22 viral species, as recognized by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses. Seven newly discovered represent putative new species. Here, our aims were to provide the most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of members and putative members of the family Arenaviridae to date, and to investigate the genetic diversity observed within and between recognized species of New world arenaviruses to determine whether the genetic criteria previously proposed to define arenavirus species for Old world arenaviruses should be retained or are more widely applicable to the whole genus.

      An apparently new agent, provisionally named Erve virus, was isolated in 1982 from tissues of three white toothed shrews, Crocidura russula, trapped near Saulges village in Western France. Results of virological and ultrastructural studies suggest that this virus belongs to the Bunyaviridae family and is a Bunyavirus-like agent. Serosurveys indicate that Erve virus had apparently a large geographical distribution in France and infects rodents, insectivores, wild boars (Sus scrofa), red deer (Cervus elaphus), sheep, herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and humans. Blood donors living in the vicinity of the Saulges area exhibit the highest incidence of antibody against Erve virus.

Serological survey carried out in the same area among 118 small wild vertebrates, mainly mammals, showed a wide-spread circulation of this agent in 1982 and 1983. Epidemiological consequences of such results are briefly discussed in terms of virus interactions.

      Sequence comparison of the V/P and F genes of 13 human, canine, porcine and simian isolates of simian virus 5 (SV5) revealed a surprising lack of sequence variation at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels (0-3%), even though the viruses were isolated over 30 years and originated from countries around the world. Furthermore, there were no clear distinguishing amino acid or nucleotide differences among the isolates that correlated completely with the species from which they were isolated. In addition, there was no evidence that the ability of the viruses to block interferon signalling by targeting STAT1 for degradation was confined to the species from which they were isolated. All isolates had an extended cytoplasmic tail in the F protein, compared with the original W3A and WR monkey isolates. Sequence analysis of viruses that were derived from human bone-marrow cells isolated in London in the 1980s revealed that, whilst they were related more closely to one another than to the other isolates, they all had identifying differences, suggesting that they were independent isolates. These results therefore support previous data suggesting that SV5 can infect humans persistently, although the relationship of SV5 to any human disease remains highly contentious. Given that SV5 has been isolated on multiple occasions from different species, it is proposed that the term simian virus 5 is inappropriate and suggested that the virus should be renamed parainfluenza virus 5.

      The incidence and prevalent types of Norwalk virus (NV), Sapporo virus (SV), and human astrovirus (HAstV) in pediatric gastroenteritis in Hiroshima Prefecture were investigated in 7 cold seasons, between 1995/96 and 2001/02. The incidences of NV, SV, and HAstV were 23.6% ranging from 16.3 to 34.4, 2.5% ranging from 1.5 to 4.7, and 3.2% ranging from 1.5 to 6.0, respectively. The peak of the incidence of NV was found in November and December. No accumulation of monthly incidence in SV or HAstV was noted. Most NVs detected belonged to genogroup II. A probe type of G2F, according to Fukuda et al., was predominant in NV, followed by G2E and G2B. The probe types of LON and SAP, according to Vinje et al., were predominant in SV. Serotype 1 was predominant in HAstV.

      Between 1985 and 1994, 368 cases of rabies in rodents (95% of reports) and lagomorphs (5%) were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia (USA), from 22 states. This was a 354% increase from the period 1971 to 1984. Most reports were cases of rabies in woodchucks (Marmota monax) (n = 317), primarily from the eastern United States, which has been recently experiencing an epizootic of raccoon (Procyon lotor) rabies. Cases of rabies in woodchucks were temporally and spatially associated with reports of raccoon rabies. Antigenic or genetic characterization of variants of rabies viruses from rodents and woodchucks corresponded to the variants associated with the major terrestrial wildlife reservoir within the geographic region of specimen origin. Although rodents and lagomorphs are infrequently infected with rabies and human contact with these animals rarely requires postexposure treatment, appropriate health authorities need to evaluate individual circumstances surrounding potential exposures.

      The aim of this study was to investigate Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related virus infection in pet dogs. The presence of antibodies to EBV antigens and EBV-related DNA was determined by Western blot analysis and PCR, respectively. Among 36 pet dogs examined for serum antibodies, 32 (88.9%) were positive for EBV-specific thymidine kinase, 15 (41.7%) for EBV-encoded DNA-binding protein and 10 (27.8%) for EBV-specific DNA polymerase. A BamHI W fragment sequence encoding part of the EBV nuclear antigen leader protein was detected by PCR in corresponding leukocyte DNA samples. Among 21 dogs tested, 15 (71.4%) were positive for the BamHI W fragment sequence. The specificity of the amplified DNA fragments was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Within the amplified region of the BamHI W fragment (241 bp), DNA sequences detected in 10 dogs had 99.2% (two nucleotide variations), 99.6% (one nucleotide variation) or 100% identity to that of EBV. Furthermore, an EBV-encoded RNA signal was detected by in situ hybridization in dog lymphocytes, as well as in bone-marrow sections, indicating a latent infection with EBV or an EBV-like virus. In conclusion, although the sample size was small, these results showed that a widespread EBV-related gammaherpesvirus could be detected in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of pet dogs. Although no evident zoonotic transmission was detected, further studies are imperative for disclosing the biological significance of this canine EBV-like virus, which may correlate with human disorders.

      An outbreak of natural measles virus infection occurred in a group of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). Over a period of 4 months, 12 of 53 Japanese macaques died following a 2-23-day history of anorexia, diarrhea, and dermatitis. The monkeys were kept in outdoor exhibits but had been moved temporarily into indoor caging and then transferred to new outdoor exhibits. Ten monkeys died while they were in temporary caging, and two monkeys died after they were moved to new outdoor exhibits. The diagnoses were made based on the results of histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and electron microscopy. Measles virus antigens were detected in the lung, stomach, skin, salivary gland, spleen, and lymph nodes. Tangled, tubular nucleocapsids compatible with paramyxovirus were noted in the lung tissue. As a result of immunosuppression following measles virus infection, various secondary infections including disseminated cytomegalovirus infection, adenoviral and bacterial pneumonia, and Candida albicans-associated gingivitis and esophagitis were noted. The primary infective source or the mode of infection could not be determined in this outbreak, but measles virus may have been transmitted to the monkeys from human visitors while the monkeys were on exhibit.

      Recently, we reported the discovery of several potential rodent reservoirs of hantaviruses in western (Holochilus chacarius) and eastern Paraguay (Akodon montensis, Oligoryzomys chacoensis, and O. nigripes). Comparisons of the hantavirus S- and M-segments amplified from these four rodents revealed significant differences from each another and from other South American hantaviruses. The ALP strain from the semiarid Chaco ecoregion clustered with Leguna Negra and Rio Mamore (LN/RM), whereas the BMJ-NEB strain from the more humid lower Chaco ecoregion formed a clade with Oran and Bermejo. The other two strains, AAI and IP37/38, were distinct from known hantaviruses. With respect to the S-segment sequence, AAI from eastern Paraguay formed a clade with ALP/LN/RM, but its M-segment clustered with Pergamino and Maciel, suggesting a possible reassortment. AAI was found in areas experiencing rapid land cover fragmentation and change within the Interior Atlantic Forest. IP37/38 did not show any strong association with any of the known hantavirus strains.

      Following an outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Paraguayan Chaco in 1995, Calomys laucha was identified as the rodent host for the hantavirus associated with these cases. To explore the possibility of additional hantaviruses in Paraguay, we collected 636 mammals from 10 of the 17 departments. Plasma from 27 animals in Alto Paraguay and Boquer6n in the Chaco and Neembucú and Itapúa in the eastern region had antibody to Andes virus antigens. Of these 27, five individuals (among four species) were positive for hantavirus RNA. Sera were collected from indigenous people in eastern Paraguay to ascertain whether persons were being infected with hantavirus outside of the Chaco. Seventeen percent were antibody-positive. These results suggest that several different hantaviruses are co-circulating in Paraguay, and that HPS cases occurring in eastern Paraguay may result from exposure to hantaviruses that are distinct from those in the Chaco.

      In late 1998, Nipah virus emerged in peninsular Malaysia and caused fatal disease in domestic pigs and humans and substantial economic loss to the local pig industry. Surveillance of wildlife species during the outbreak showed neutralizing antibodies to Nipah virus mainly in Island flying-foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus) and Malayan flying-foxes (Pteropus vampyrus) but no virus reactive with anti-Nipah virus antibodies was isolated. We adopted a novel approach of collecting urine from these Island flying-foxes and swabs of their partially eaten fruits. Three viral isolates (two from urine and one from a partially eaten fruit swab) that caused Nipah virus-like syncytial cytopathic effect in Vero cells and stained strongly with Nipah- and Hendra-specific antibodies were isolated. Molecular sequencing and analysis of the 11,200-nucleotide fragment representing the beginning of the nucleocapsid gene to the end of the glycoprotein gene of one isolate confirmed the isolate to be Nipah virus with a sequence deviation of five to six nucleotides from Nipah virus isolated from humans. The isolation of Nipah virus from the Island flying-fox corroborates the serological evidence that it is one of the natural hosts of the virus.

      The nucleoprotein genes of 54 human, domestic and wild animals rabies isolates obtained in Argentina between 1995 and 2002 were characterized using monoclonal antibodies and partial gene sequence analysis. The antigenic and genetic diversities of rabies virus in samples from bat and bat-related cases were studied, leading to the identification of five distinct genetic variants. Rabies viruses isolated from vampire bat related cases were very similar to each other, showing 98.9% overall similarity. Specific antigenic variants (AgV) were detected associated with different insectivorous bats species, in samples from Tadarida brasiliensis and Eumops patagonicus bats. In contrast, isolates from Myotis sp. and Histiotus sp. bats could not be matched to any antigenic type. Additionally, bat rabies cases were also detected in southern provinces previously considered rabies-free. Finally, two independent antigenic and genetic variants co-circulating in northern Argentina were found in isolates obtained from dogs and dog-related cases, suggesting two independent cycles of virus transmission. This is the first national coordinated study of antigenic as well as molecular epidemiology of rabies in Argentina. The information presented here will improve our knowledge about rabies epidemiology and therefore, will assist preventing fatal human cases.

      Everglades virus (EVEV), an alphavirus in the Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex, circulates among rodents and vector mosquitoes in Florida and occasionally infects humans. It causes febrile disease, sometimes accompanied by neurologic manifestations. Although previous surveys showed high seroprevalence in humans, EVEV infections may be underdiagnosed because the disease is not severe enough to warrant a clinic visit or the undifferentiated presentations complicate diagnosis. Documented EVEV activity, as recent as 1993, was limited to south Florida. Using dogs as sentinels, a serosurvey was conducted to evaluate whether EVEV circulated recently in Florida and whether EVEV's spatial distribution parallels that of the mosquito vector, Culex cedecei. Four percent of dog sera contained neutralizing EVEV antibodies, and many seropositive animals lived farther north than both recorded EVEV activity and the principal vector. These results indicate that EVEV is widespread in Florida and may be an important, unrecognized cause of human illness.

      Arenavirus Sabiá was originally isolated from a fatal human infection in Brazil, and after the occurrence of the second fatal human case in São Paulo state, epidemiologic and virologic studies were performed in the area where the patient lived, aiming at the identification of the Sabiá natural rodent reservoir. A broadly cross-reactive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to screen for antibody-positive samples. Antibodies to arenavirus were detected in two of the 55 samples of Calomys tener, and from these results, samples of rodents were analyzed by a broad RT-PCR assay. RT-PCR amplification detected arenavirus sequences in five of the 55 C. tener samples, and sequencing showed that this virus is a distinct form of Sabiá virus. Thus, we describe here the evidence for the circulation of a new arenavirus in Brazil (proposed name Pinhal virus) and its genetic characterization compared to other arenaviruses. This study also suggests C. tener as a probable rodent reservoir for this virus and associates this new virus with the lineage C of New World arenaviruses. Although we have defined some characteristics of this virus, so far, there is no evidence of its involvement in human disease.

      A bovine adenovirus with agglutinating activity was isolated from feedlot calves and classified as serotype 3. The agglutinating activity was shown to be the property of an adenovirus-associated virus (AAV). The AAV was isolated from the bovine adenovirus by isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl; the AAV had a density of 1.4 g/cm2. This AAV is serologically related to bovine AAV-TR-15, but is distinct from bovine parvovirus-1 and primate AAV types 1 to 4, using counterimmunoelectrophoresis and hemagglutination-inhibition.

      Maedi Visna virus (MVV) causes progressive degenerative inflammatory disease in multiple organs including the lungs (pneumonia, 'maedi'), mammary gland, joints and nervous system (meningoencephalomyelitis, 'visna') in sheep. Maedi Visna Virus has been detected in macrophages of several tissues and epithelial cells in vivo: bone marrow, cells of the central nervous system, lung and bronchial tissues, milk epithelial cells recovered from milk samples and epithelial cells of mammary tissue. However, the presence of MVV in the genital tracts of naturally infected ewes has not previously been studied. The aim of this study was to use nested-PCR, targeting the gag gene, to determine whether genital tissues (ovaries, oviducts and uterus) from 83 ewes originating from various breeding herds in the South-East of France were positive for MVV-proviral DNA. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) tested positive for MVV-proviral DNA, using nested-PCR analysis, in 57.8% of ewes (48/83). The provirus was also identified in 47% (78/166) of the ovaries, 38.6% (64/166) of the oviducts and 45.8% (38/83) of the uteri sampled. These findings clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that tissue samples from the genital tract of ewes (ovary, oviduct and uterus) can be infected with MVV. This suggests that there is a risk of vertical and/or horizontal transmission of MVV during embryo transfer from embryos produced in vivo or in vitro.

      The monitoring of herpesvirus infection plays a central role in lung transplantation (LT). Herein we evaluated the prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7), and Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and transbronchial biopsy (TBB) specimens from LT patients. We associated the findings with the occurrence of interstitial pneumonia, acute rejection, or organizing pneumonia. Viral DNA was detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on 76 paired samples (BAL and TBB) from 27 patients who were receiving a universal combined prophylaxis (cytomegalovirus [CMV] immunoglobulin [Ig] + gancyclovir or valgancyclovir). Histopathological analysis was performed in accordance with the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria. Overall, HCMV results were positive in 25/76 (32.9%) specimens (BAL and/or TBB); HHV-6 in 16 (21.1%); HHV-7 in 40 (52.6%); and EBV in 13 (17.1%). Interstitial pneumonia was diagnosed in 6/76 (7.9%) cases: 5 (83.3%) were positive to HCMV (combined specimens; P < .0001); 5 (83.3%) to HHV-7; and 2 (33.3%) to EBV. An acute rejection episode was diagnosed in 19/76 (25%) cases: 7 (36.8%) were positive to HCMV; 5 (26.3%) to HHV-6; 10 (52.6%) to HHV-7, and 3 (15.8%) to EBV. No significant association was observed between virus detection or load and acute rejection. Organizing pneumonia was diagnosed in 4/76 (5.3%) cases: 1 (25%) positive to HCMV; 4 (100%) to HHV-6 (P < .05); 2 (50%) to HHV-7; and none to EBV. In conclusion, the prevalence of HCMV tended to be lower than that reported in the literature, confirming the importance of universal combined prophylaxis. HCMV was a relevant agent for interstitial pneumonia; although the small numbers limit the statistical analysis, our data did not support an association between herpesviruses and acute rejection episodes, whereas the role of HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of organizing pneumonia deserves further study. Viral detection on TBB could represent an adjunctive tool to complement that on BAL.

      Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is a pestivirus that infects mainly bovine cattle. Nevertheless, there are several reports about infections in other members of the Artiodactyla order including serological studies, that indicate infection of BVDV in buffaloes. The aim of this article is to study the presence of BVDV in three young water buffaloes, displaying nonspecific clinical signs, compatible with the BVDV infection. Both immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR confirmed the presence of BVDV in the animals. The sequence analysis on RT-PCR amplicons revealed high identity with reference strains of genotypes 1a and 1b. Although BVDV was unequivocally identified in the sick animals, it has not been proved it is responsible for the clinical signs. Further studies are needed to clarify the pathogenic role of BVDV infection in this animal species, and the role of buffaloes in the epidemiology of BVDV infection.

      Pseudorabies is caused by Suid herpesvirus 1, a member of the Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily. Although pigs are the natural host of Pseudorabies virus (PRV), the virus has a broad host range and may cause fatal encephalitis in many species. The United States obtained PRV-free status in 2004 after the virus was eradicated from domestic swineherds, but the virus is still present in feral swine populations. The current report describes PRV infection in 3 dogs that were used to hunt feral swine. The dogs developed clinical signs including facial pruritus with facial abrasions, dyspnea, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, muscle stiffness, and death. Two were euthanized, and 1 died within approximately 48 hr after onset of clinical signs. The salient histologic changes consisted of neutrophilic trigeminal ganglioneuritis with neuronophagia and equivocal intranuclear inclusion bodies. Pseudorabies virus was isolated from fresh tissues from 2 of the dogs, and immunohistochemistry detected the virus in the third dog. Virus sequencing and phylogeny, based upon available GenBank sequences, revealed that the virus was likely a field strain that was closely related to a cluster of PRV strains previously identified in Illinois. Though eradicated from domestic swine in the United States, PRV is present in populations of feral swine, and should therefore continue to be considered a possible cause of disease in dogs and other domestic animals with compatible clinical history and signs. Continued surveillance is necessary to prevent reintroduction of PRV into domestic swine.

      The reservoir host of cowpox virus in Western Europe is not known, but epidemiological evidence from human and feline infections indicates that the virus is probably endemic in small wild rodents. Therefore, serum and tissue samples were collected from a variety of wild British mammals and some birds, and tested for evidence of Orthopoxvirus infection. Antibody reacting with cowpox virus was detected in 9/44 (20%) bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), 8/24 (33%) field voles (Microtus agrestis), 17/86 (20%) wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and 1/44 house mice (Mus musculus), but in no other animal species tested. Although virus was not isolated from any animal, this serological survey, together with other evidence, suggests that bank and field voles and wood mice are the main reservoir hosts of cowpox virus in Great Britain.

      Recent studies have shown high levels of antibody to the parainfluenza virus group in human sera collected in New England and in other populations in various parts of the world. In view of the importance of animals as reservoirs of viruses affecting man, studies were carried out to assess the level of immunity to the parainfluenza, DA and mumps viruses in domestic animals (cows, swine, dogs, cats, lambs, and sheep) in New England.Antibody levels were determined by the haemagglutination-inhibition test. The results indicated that parainfluenza 3 was the most prevalent followed by parainfluenza 2 and parainfluenza 1; high levels were also found for DA and mumps viruses.A modified agar-gel diffusion test for detecting mumps precipitating antibodies was also investigated. Mumps-immune sera showed a reaction against concentrated soluble antigen. A comparison of the agar-gel diffusion method and standard serological methods, including complement-fixation, neutralization and haemagglutination-inhibition, indicated a significant correlation between the various techniques.

      In this study, 336 bats of eight species were collected during 2004-2007 in six provinces of Southern China. Antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) were detected by ELISA in 43 of 336 (12.8%) serum samples. Among those ELISA-positive samples, 11 serum samples had neutralizing antibodies against JEV. No JEV was detected in brain and liver samples using specific real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. This is the first report of JEV neutralizing antibodies in bats in China, which reinforces that bats can be involved in the life cycle of this virus.

      This study was aimed to evaluate and compare the pathogenicity of rabies virus isolated from bats and dogs, and to verify the efficacy of a commercial rabies vaccine against these isolates. For evaluation of pathogenicity, mice were inoculated by the intramuscular route (IM) with 500MICLD₅₀/0.03 mL of the viruses. The cross-protection test was performed by vaccinating groups of mice by the subcutaneous route and challenged through the intracerebral (IC) route. Isolates were fully pathogenic when inoculated by the IC route. When inoculated intramuscularly, the pathogenicity observed showed different death rates: 60.0% for the Desmodus rotundus isolate; 50.0% for dog and Nyctinomops laticaudatus isolates; 40.0% for Artibeus lituratus isolate; 9.5% Molossus molossus isolate; and 5.2% for the Eptesicus furinalis isolate. Mice receiving two doses of the vaccine and challenged by the IC route with the isolates were fully protected. Mice receiving only one dose of vaccine were partially protected against the dog isolate. The isolates from bats were pathogenic by the IC route in mice. However, when inoculated through the intramuscular route, the same isolates were found with different degrees of pathogenicity. The results of this work suggest that a commercial vaccine protects mice from infection with bat rabies virus isolates, in addition to a canine rabies virus isolate.

      Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was not detected in Florida pumas (Puma concolor coryi) in almost 20 yr of surveillance; however, the finding of two FeLV antigen-positive pumas during the 2002-2003 capture season led to an investigation of FeLV in the population. Between January 1990 and April 2007, the proportion of pumas testing FeLV antibody positive increased, with antibody-positive pumas concentrated in the northern portion of puma range. Five of 131 (4%) pumas sampled between July 2000 and April 2007 were viremic, with all cases clustered in Okaloacoochee Slough (OKS). Clinical signs and clinical pathology at capture were absent or included lymphadenopathy, moderate-to-severe anemia, and lymphopenia. All viremic pumas died; causes of death were septicemia (n=2), intraspecific aggression (n=2), and anemia/dehydration (n=1). Outcome after FeLV exposure in pumas was similar to that in domestic cats, with evidence of regressive, latent, and persistent infections. Management of the epizootic included vaccination, and as of April 2007, 52 free-ranging pumas had received one or more inoculations. Vaccinations were concentrated in OKS and in a band between OKS and the remainder of the puma population. There have been no new cases since July 2004; however, the potential for reintroduction of the virus remains.

      The isolation and characterization of three new viruses obtained from the Tucuruí hydroelectric dam region is reported. These three agents belong to the Anopheles A serogroup, genus Bunyavirus, Bunyaviridae. The Tucuruí (TUC), caraipé (CPE) and Arumateua (ART) viruses have close relationships with each other and with Trombetas (TBT) virus, an Anopheles A virus previously isolated in the Amazon Region of Brazil. These viruses form the ""Trombetas complex"". TUC, CPE and ART viruses were obtained from pools of Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) sp captured in Tucuruí, Pará State, in February, August and October of 1984, respectively. Until 1990 TUC, CPE and ART were isolated 12, 32 and 28 times respectively, in the Tucuruí hydroelectric dam region. At the moment, these viruses have only been obtained from mosquitoes of the Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) complex, especially from An. (Nys.) nuneztovari and An. (Nys.) triannulatus, that are considered to be secondary vectors of Plasmodium in Amazonia. Serological tests performed with human and wild animal sera were negative, except for one specimen Nasua nasua that had neutralization antibodies to TUC.

      Human astroviruses (HAstVs) are one of the major viral agents of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in all age groups, especially in young children. In this study, new one-step real-time RT-PCR and nested RT-PCR assays were developed to detect HAstVs. HAstVs were identified in 46 (8.75%) of 526 stool samples in Jiangmen City over 1 year, including 43 (9.15%) of 470 children and 3 (5.4%) of 56 adults, and HAstV-1 was the most predominant strain. This finding suggests that HAstVs infections are common in Jiangmen City, China. Further detailed molecular epidemiological studies are required for understanding the prevalence of HAstVs infection and gaining knowledge about the circulating genotypes.

      The biological properties of poxvirus isolates from skin lesions on dairy cows and milkers during recent exanthem episodes in Cantagalo County, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, were more like vaccinia virus (VV) than cowpox virus. PCR amplification of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene substantiated the isolate classification as an Old World orthopoxvirus, and alignment of the HA sequences with those of other orthopoxviruses indicated that all the isolates represented a single strain of VV, which we have designated Cantagalo virus (CTGV). HA sequences of the Brazilian smallpox vaccine strain (VV-IOC), used over 20 years ago, and CTGV showed 98.2% identity; phylogeny inference of CTGV, VV-IOC, and 12 VV strains placed VV-IOC and CTGV together in a distinct clade. Viral DNA restriction patterns and protein profiles showed a few differences between VV-IOC and CTGV. Together, the data suggested that CTGV may have derived from VV-IOC by persisting in an indigenous animal(s), accumulating polymorphisms, and now emerging in cattle and milkers as CTGV. CTGV may represent the first case of long-term persistence of vaccinia in the New World.

      Few data are available on the prevalence of feline viruses in European wildcats (Felis silvestris). Previous surveys have indicated that wildcats may be infected with the common viruses of domestic cats, apart from feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). In the present study, 50 wildcats trapped throughout Scotland (UK) between August 1992 and January 1997 were tested for evidence of viral infection. All were negative for FIV by several serological or virological methods. By contrast, 10% of the cats were positive for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen and infectious virus was isolated from 13% of a smaller subset. Of the wildcats tested for respiratory viruses, 25% yielded feline calicivirus (FCV) and although no feline herpesvirus was isolated, 16% of the samples had neutralizing antibodies to this virus. Antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV) were found in 6% of samples. Feline foamy virus (FFV) was an incidental finding in 33% of samples tested. This study confirms that wildcats in Scotland are commonly infected with the major viruses of the domestic cat, except for FIV.

      Complement fixation test reactions to the following viruses were studied in 372 samples (157 rodents, 172 domestic animals, 43 persons) from Pakistan: Bunyaviridae, Phlebovirus: Phlebotomus fever Sicilian (PFS), Phlebotomus fever Naples (PFN), Karimabad (KAR), Salehabad (SAL); Nairovirus: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Hazara (HAZ), Dera Ghazi Khan (DGK), Dhori (DHO); Uukuvirus: Manawa (MWA); ""possible members"": Bakau (BAK), Bhanja (BHA). Reoviridae, Orbivirus: Wad Medani (WM). Unclassified: Wanowrie (WAN). Four of these viruses are Phlebotomus-borne (PFS, PFN, KAR, SAL). The other nine ar tick-borne. Antibodies against each virus were detected in sera from rodents. Antibodies against PFS, PFN, KAR, CCHF, DGK, BHA, WM and WAN viruses were detected in sera from domestic animals. Antibodies against PFS, CCHF, DGK, DHO, MWA, BHA, and BHA and WAN viruses were detected in human sera. The presence in Pakistan of KAR, DHO, BHA, and WAN viruses is documented for the first time. Over-all prevalence rates were highest for BHA (12.1%) and WM (10.7%) viruses, followed by DGK, CCHF, PFN and PFS (4.0 to 5.4%) and DHO, KAR, WAN, SAL, MWA, BAK and HAZ (0.3 to 2.1%). Epidemiological factors relating to virus circulation and human disease are discussed.

      Cervid herpesvirus 2 (CvHV2) has been isolated from reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), and serological data indicate that in reindeer this virus is endemic in Fennoscandia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. CvHV2 has been described as a cause of subclinical genital infections in reindeer, but little information on primary infections exists. In this study, six seronegative and presumably pregnant reindeer were allocated to one of two groups. Two animals were inoculated with CvHV2 intratracheally, and two animals intravaginally, with one control animal in each group receiving sterile water. Mild hyperthermia and serous discharges from the vagina and nose were observed. No abortions were recorded, but one calf died shortly after birth. Inoculated animals seroconverted and had neutralizing antibodies after days 7 to 10 postinfection. CvHV2 was detected by PCR in nasal and vaginal swabs from animals in both groups but could be isolated only from nasal swabs in the respiratory group and from vaginal swabs in the genital group. CvHV2 was detected by PCR in various organs and tissues postmortem. In control animals, the virus could not be isolated in spite of PCR-positive nasal and vaginal swab samples and some degree of positive immunostaining. One of the animals that were inoculated intratracheally developed a hemorrhagic, necrotizing bronchopneumonia, which was CvHV2 positive by PCR and immunohistochemistry. We conclude that CvHV2 can cause systemic infection, that both genital and respiratory inoculations can lead to virus shedding, and that the virus can infect the fetus in utero.

      Borna disease virus (BDV) is an enveloped, non-segmented negative-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the Bornaviridae family. BDV is an aetiological agent of encephalitis in horses, sheep and several other vertebrate species. In order to extend our knowledge about the presence of BDV in France, a study based on BDV RNA detection by RT-nested-PCR was done with 196 animal tissues: 171 brain samples collected from different animal species (75 horses, 59 foxes, 31 cattle, 4 dogs, 1 sheep, 1 roe deer) and 25 horse blood samples. An RNA internal standard molecule was constructed and was co-amplified with the test template. This study reports the first detection of BDV RNA in France in 10 brain samples collected from horses, foxes and cattle, and from 14 horse blood samples. Detection of the BDV genome in the brains of six red foxes is the first evidence of BDV infection in this species.

      Diagnostic findings were reviewed on 157 sick or dead gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) from the southeastern United States examined during the period 1972 through 1989. Most foxes (n = 118) originated from Georgia; fewer animals were from Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. Etiologic diagnoses included canine distemper (n = 125), congenital absence of guard hairs (n = 7), traumatic injuries (n = 7), rabies (n = 3), suspected toxicoses (n = 3), verminous pneumonia due to Paragonimus kellicotti (n = 1), bacterial septicemia secondary to Dracunculus insignis (n = 1), and tick paralysis (n = 1). Concurrent toxoplasmosis or toxoplasmosis or cryptosporidiosis was noted in six and three foxes with canine distemper, respectively. Only lesion diagnoses were attainable for three foxes, and six cases were classified as undetermined. Canine distemper was diagnosed in 78% of the foxes, was geographically widespread, was detected in 16 of 18 yr, and exhibited a seasonal pattern of occurrence. These facts indicate that canine distemper is more significant as a mortality factor for gray foxes than all other infectious and noninfectious diseases combined.

      Nairobi sheep disease was seen principally upon movement of susceptible animals into the enzootic areas. This occurred most frequently for marketing purposes near the main centres of population. Other outbreaks followed local breakdowns in tick control measures. The disease did not occur in epizootic form during the period under consideration. Nairobi sheep disease was isolated from pools of Rhipicephalus appendiculatus but not from many pools of other tick species. No virus was isolated from the blood or tissues of a range of wild ruminants and rodents.

      Lumpy skin disease virus strains isolated in Kenya over a period of some 20 years have proved to be serologically identical. They were indistinguishable by indirect fluorescent antibody and serum neutralization test from the South African Neethling and West African serotypes. These two serological methods proved of value in studying the antibody responses to infection. While epizootic spread of LSD has occurred in Kenya, most cases are of a sporadic nature and are thought to be the result of accidental contacts with a maintenance cycle. There is evidence of antibody to LSD in the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in those areas where LSD is considered to be enzootic in Kenya, and also in small numbers of domestic cattle. No buffalo or bovine sera contained antibody to cowpox virus. An area enzootic for LSD is proposed and it is suggested that the maintenance cycle involves the buffalo. No antibody was found in the other wild ruminant species examined.

      Serum neutralizing antibody to Akabane virus (genus bunyavirus, family Bunyaviridae) was found in a high proportion (50-95%) of cattle sampled in Kenya, while sheep and goats had fewer positive (13-33%). Camel and horse sera also contained antibody to the virus (70% and 50% respectively). The antibody was found in animals from the high altitude temperature type of grasslands, drier bushed and wooded grasslands and the semi-desert. No arthrogryposis nor hydranencephaly has been encountered in Kenya which might be related to this widespread virus infection. A wide range of Kenyan wild ruminants had antibody to Akabane virus in their sera, as also did zebra.

      Ephemeral fever antibody was found in domestic cattle in Kenya across a wide range of ecological zones, from highland forests and grasslands to desert and semidesert thorn scrub. Antibody was found in several species of game animals, notably waterbuck and buffalo, where over 50% of the samples showed antibody to EF. Evidence was obtained to show that the virus had been cycling in these wild ruminant populations between epizootics in domestic cattle.

      Sera from domestic cattle, sheep and goats and 11 wild bovid species taken at 41 locations throughout Kenya were screened for antibody to bluetongue virus using the indirect fluorescent antibody method. Positive sera were found at 39 locations and in all the species tested. The distribution of clinical disease was mapped and found to be more restricted than the distribution of antibody. Culicoides were collected in light traps at 55 locations throughout Kenya. The presumptive vector of bluetongue in Kenya, C. pallidipennis, was the most widespread species, found in 38 locations. Both the distribution of antibody and Culicoides have been tabulated by ecological zones to demonstrate that bluetongue virus in its natural state in cattle and wild bovids is far more widespread than clinical bluetongue disease seen in exotic sheep of restricted distribution; and that C. pallidipennis has great ecological range.

      The distribution of West Nile virus has expanded in the past 6 years to include the 48 contiguous United States and seven Canadian provinces, as well as Mexico, the Caribbean islands, and Colombia. The suggestion of the emergence of a dominant genetic variant has led to an intensive analysis of isolates made across North America. We have sequenced the pre-membrane and envelope genes of 74 isolates and the complete genomes of 25 isolates in order to determine if a dominant genotype has arisen and to better understand how the virus has evolved as its distribution has expanded. Phylogenetic analyses revealed the continued presence of genetic variants that group in a temporally and geographically dependent manner and provide evidence that a dominant variant has emerged across much of North America. The implications of these findings are discussed as they relate to transmission and spread of the virus in the Western Hemisphere.

      From 1987 through 1991, blood samples were collected from 10 species of small mammals in Indian River Country, Florida (USA). Sera from 1,347 animals were analyzed for hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody to St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses. Of these, 75 (5.6%) were positive for HI antibody to SLE virus and 121 (9.0%) were positive for EEE antibody. Sera from five mammalian species were tested for neutralizing (NT) antibody to SLE, EEE, Highlands J (HJ a member of the western equine encephalitis virus complex), or Everglades (EVE, a member of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex) viruses. By serum neutralization tests, 26 (46%) of 57 had SLE antibodies, 14 (24%) of 58 had EEE antibodies, two (3.2%) of 63 had HJ antibodies, and 9 (14%) of 63 had EVE antibodies. One Sigmodon hispidus and one Peromyscus gossypinus had NT antibodies both to EEE and HJ viruses. Blood samples from 512 mammals were tested for virus. Isolations of one EVE virus and two unidentified arenaviruses were made from P. gossypinus and one EVE virus isolate was made from a S. hispidus.

      From January 1990 through March 1991, 189 armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) were collected from Brevard and Glades Counties in southern Florida (USA). The sera were analyzed for hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibodies against St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) viruses. None of the armadillos had detectable HAI antibody to EEE virus, but 59 (31%) had antibodies against SLE virus. Sera from 31 of the HAI-positive armadillos contained significant levels of neutralizing (NT) antibody to SLE virus. Armadillos captured during the 1990 SLE human epidemic in south Florida had a greater prevalence of HAI and NT antibody to SLE virus than did animals captured before the start of the epidemic. This is evidence that armadillos were fed on by mosquitoes infected with SLE virus. We propose that armadillos may be involved in the SLE amplification and transmission cycles in Florida.

      To determine the specificity of Morogoro virus for its reservoir host, we studied its host range and genetic diversity in Tanzania. We found that 2 rodent species other than Mastomys natalensis mice carry arenaviruses. Analysis of 340 nt of the viral RNA polymerase gene showed sympatric occurrence of 3 distinct arenaviruses.

      Here, for the first time, we report the nucleotide sequence of Caraparu virus (CARV) L segment and the analysis of the RNA polymerase region 3 encoded by this segment. The 1,404 bp nucleotide sequence shares the highest identity with Bunyamwera, La Crosse, Oropouche, and Akabane virus sequences. The amino acid sequence was deduced and aligned with sequences from members of the Bunyaviridae family and used for phylogenetic analysis. The CARV clustered in the Orthobunyavirus genus. The premotif A and motifs A-E are present in the region 3 of the Bunyaviridae family, were also conserved in CARV L protein, as well as other conserved regions among Orthobunyavirus genus.

      Two healthy buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in a herd which had not been vaccinated against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), were selected for their seropositivity for anti-bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) glycoprotein E antibodies, and injected intramuscularly daily with dexamethasone for five consecutive days (day 1 to day 5) to reactivate any latent herpesvirus. Blood samples and nasal and vaginal swabs were collected daily from day 5 to day 15 from each buffalo for virological examination. All the vaginal swabs and blood samples were negative, but 13 of the 22 nasal swabs were positive; a cytopathic effect was observed in primary cultures of bovine fetal lung cells, and the viral isolates were identified as a herpesvirus by PCR. The viral strains were characterised by the sequence analysis of the genes coding for glycoproteins D and B, and the gene sequences were then used for phylogenetic analysis. The isolates from both buffaloes appeared identical at the level of the two genes, and were more closely related to bovine herpesvirus type 5 than to BoHV-1.

      One hundred and five rabies isolates obtained from domestic animals and insectivorous bats in Chile between 1977 and 1998 were molecularly characterized by limited sequence analysis of their nucleoprotein genes. These isolates were compared with viruses isolated from known domestic and wildlife rabies reservoirs in the Americas to identify potential reservoirs of rabies in Chile. The phylogenetic analyses showed that none of the Chilean isolates segregated with viruses from the terrestrial reservoirs. No non-rabies lyssaviruses were found in this study. The Chilean samples were not related to viruses of the sylvatic cycle maintained by the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) in Latin America. Five genetic variants were identified from insectivorous bats in Chile. The Brazilian free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis) was identified as the reservoir for the rabies genetic variant most frequently isolated in the country between 1977 and 1998. The close association of a group of viruses obtained from a domestic dog (Canis familiaris), Brazilian free-tailed bats, and a red bat (Lasiurus borealis) with viruses maintained by Lasiurus spp. in North America implicated species of this genus as the possible reservoirs of this particular genetic variant in Chile. Reservoirs for the other three variants remain unknown.

      An ecological assessment of reservoir species was conducted in a rural area (Jaborá) in the mid-west of the state of Santa Catarina in southern Brazil, where hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is endemic, to evaluate the prevalence of hantavirus infection in wild rodents. Blood and tissue samples were collected from 507 rodents during seven field trips from March 2004 to April 2006. Some of the animals were karyotyped to confirm morphological identification. Phylogenetic reconstructions of rodent specimens, based on the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene sequences, were also obtained. Hantavirus antibody was found in 22 (4.3%) of the 507 rodents: 5 Akodon montensis, 2 Akodon paranaensis, 14 Oligoryzomys nigripes, and 1 Sooretamys angouya. Viral RNAs detected in O. nigripes and A. montensis were amplified and sequenced. O. nigripes virus genome was 97.5% (nt) and 98.4% (nt) identical to sequences published for Araucaria (Juquitiba-like) virus based on N and G2 fragment sequences. Viral sequences from A. montensis strain showed 89% and 88% nucleotide identities in a 905-nt fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) protein-coding region of the S segment when it was compared with two other Akodontine rodent-associated viruses from Paraguay, A. montensis and Akodon cursor, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed the cocirculation of two genetic hantavirus lineages in the state of Santa Catarina, one from O. nigripes and the other from A. montensis, previously characterized in Brazil and Paraguay, respectively. The hantavirus associated with A. montensis, designed Jaborá virus, represents a distinct phylogenetic lineage among the Brazilian hantaviruses.

      Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is a parapoxvirus associated with papular and erosive lesions on the muzzle, lips, and oral mucosa of cattle. Teats of milking cows are occasionally affected, and the infection is frequently transmitted to human beings. The present report describes an outbreak of BPSV infection affecting cows in midwestern Brazil, with human involvement. The disease was observed in neighboring small hand-milking farms, affecting 20 milking cows. The signs included painful reddish papules, ulcers, and scabby proliferative lesions on the teats, with a clinical course of 7-12 days. Affected cows presented severe local pain, not allowing the completion of milking. Histologically, acanthosis, spongiosis, and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis with adjacent focally extensive ulcers and multifocal inflammatory infiltrate were observed in the epidermis. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies were noted in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. Personnel milking the affected cows developed lesions on the hands, painful papules that progressed to ulcerative and scabby lesions in 4-7 days. A polymerase chain reaction using a set of pan-parapoxvirus primers for the B2L gene performed on DNA extracted from scabs amplified a 590-bp product, which when sequenced, revealed similarities of 99%, 85%, and 84% with BPSV, Pseudocowpox virus, and Orf virus, respectively. A phylogenetic tree based on the B2L sequence was constructed, showing that the virus clustered with BPSV isolates. Although clinical cases compatible with BSPV infection have been frequently described in Brazil, the present report identifies the agent associated with cattle and human disease in the country.

      Eight strains of a flavivirus identified as St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus were isolated from wild rodents, birds, and sentinel mice in three locations in the State of São Paulo, Brazil from 1967--1969. No illness attributable to SLE virus infection was detected among the local inhabitants, although about 5% of the local population had neutralizing antibodies to this virus.

      Bertioga and Anhembi are two newly recognized arboviruses that were isolated in Saõ Paulo, Brazil. Bertioga was isolated from sentinel mice exposed in a forest of that name, and was shown to belong serologically to the Guama group of arboviruses. Anhembi, the second virus described, was isolated from pools of mosquitoes (Phoniomyia pilicauda and trichoprosopon pallidiventer), and from a spiny rat (Proechimys iheringi), and was shown to be a new member of the Bunyamwera group. The viruses are sensitive to sodium desoxycholate and are filterable through a millipore membrane of 450 mum pore size. Both are pathogenic for suckling mice and grow well in Vero cells, producing clear cytopathic effects. Detailed antigenic comparisons of Anhembi virus with other members of the Bunyamwera group isolated in the Americas, and of Bertioga virus with the members of the Guama group are presented. Both are believed to be new arboviruses in their groups.

      A serological survey for yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue 2 virus (DENV-2), and St Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) was undertaken using a seroneutralization technique in 27 wild forest mammal species (574 individuals) in French Guiana. Evidence of yellow fever infection was observed in 10 species, with high prevalence recorded in howler monkey (18%) and agouti (20%). Antibodies against DENV-2 and SLEV were found sporadically in various species. This potential host diversity and the range of potential vectors might explain the behaviour of the viruses in epidemic outbreaks and the emergence of periurban loci.

      The recent finding of a novel Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphocryptovirus (CalHV-3) in a captive colony of common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in the United States modifies the view that the host range of lymphocryptovirus is restricted to humans and Old World primates. We investigated the presence of Epstein-Barr virus-related viruses in 79 samples of New World monkeys caught in the wild, including six species of the Cebidae family and one of the Callitrichidae, living in the rain forest of French Guiana. Using a degenerate consensus PCR method for the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene, we identified three novel lymphocryptoviruses from golden-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas) of the Callitrichidae family and squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia) of the Cebidae family. With the CalHV-3 strain, these three novel viruses constitute a well-supported phylogenetic clade in the Lymphocryptovirus genus, which is clearly distinct from the lineage of Old World lymphocryptovirus, hosted by catarrhine monkeys and humans. In tamarins, the prevalence of the novel lymphocryptovirus was more than 50%, indicating that it circulates well in the wild population, perhaps due to specific ecoethological patterns such as confrontations and intergroup migration. The detection and partial molecular characterization of the polymerase gene of three novel Gamma-1-Herpesvirinae from New World monkeys caught in the wild clearly indicate that free-ranging populations of platyrrhine are natural hosts of lymphocryptoviruses. Further characterization of these novel viruses will provide new insight not only into the origin and evolution of Gammaherpesvirinae but also into their pathogenicity.

      Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) belongs to the recently recognized Arteriviridae family within the genus Arterivirus, order Nidovirales, which also includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). Mature viral particles are composed of an envelope 50-72 nm in diameter, with an isometric core about 20-30 nm enclosing a linear positive-stranded RNA genome of approximately 15 kb. The virions are assembled by the budding of preformed nucleocapsids into the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and/or Golgi apparatus. The mature virions are then released by exocytosis. The viral genome contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) which are transcribed in cells as a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs. The ORF1a and ORF1b situated at the 5'end of the genome represent nearly 75% of the viral genome and code for proteins with apparent replicase and polymerase activities. The major structural proteins consist of a 25 kDa envelope glycoprotein (GP5), an 18-19 kDa unglycosylated membrane protein (M), and a 15 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein, encoded by ORFs 5, 6 and 7, respectively. The N protein is the more abundant protein of the virion and is highly antigenic, which therefore makes it a suitable candidate for the detection of virus-specific antibodies and diagnosis of the disease. Four to five domains of antigenic importance have been identified for the N protein, a common conformational antigenic site for European and North American strains being localized in the central region of the protein. In cells and virions, both M and GP5 occur in heterodimeric complexes linked by disulfide bonds. The expression products of ORFs 2 and 4 are also incorporated into virus particles as additional minor membrane-associated glycoproteins designated as GP2 and GP4, with M(r) of 29 and 31 kDa, respectively. The structural nature of the ORF3 product, a highly glycosylated protein with an apparent M(r) of 42 kDa, is still being debated, in view of the apparently conflicting data on its presence in virus particles. Nonetheless, the GP3 of North American and European strains has been shown to be antigenic, providing protection for piglets against PRRSV infection in the absence of a noticeable neutralizing humoral response. Pigs exposed to the native form of GP5 by means of DNA immunization develop specific neutralizing and protecting antibodies. The GP5 is involved in antigenic variability, apoptosis, and possibly antibody-dependent enhancement phenomena. The GP4 also possesses antigenic determinants that trigger the immune system to produce neutralizing antibodies. Each of the PRRSV structural proteins carries common and type-specific antigenic determinants that permit the ability to differentiate between European and North American strains. The potential use of the PRRSV structural proteins in subunit recombinant-type vaccines is also discussed.

      A mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) strain was isolated from a pup with fatal diarrhea, which had a concurrent infection by canine parvovirus type 2. The reovirus isolate showed an atypical hemagglutination pattern and a retarded electrophoretic mobility of the S1 segment, which is characteristic of MRV type 3 (MRV-3). Assignment of the isolated virus to MRV-3 was confirmed by type-specific RT-PCR assays, targeting the S1 gene, and by subsequent sequence analysis of the PCR product. By phylogeny based on the S1 gene of several MRVs, the isolate fell into lineage E, along with the murine strain T3C9/61 and the bovine strains T3C18/61 and T3C31/59. Conversely, L1 sequences were found to segregate regardless of the viral type. A total of 110 fecal samples, 56 nasal and 31 ocular swabs from dogs with diarrhea or nasal/ocular discharge were tested by a nested-PCR assay specific for reoviruses, and no sample was found to contain MRV RNA, a finding that is apparently in contrast with the seroprevalence (25.77%) observed in dogs.

      Maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) are neotropic mammals, listed as a CITES Appendix II species, with a distribution south of the Amazon forest from Bolivia, through northern Argentina and Paraguay and into eastern Brazil and northern Uruguay. Primary threats to the survival of free-ranging maned wolves include habitat loss, road kills, and shooting by farmers. An additional threat to the conservation of maned wolves is the risk of morbidity and mortality due to infectious and parasitic diseases. Captive maned wolves are susceptible to, and die from, common infectious diseases of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) including canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), rabies virus, and canine adenovirus (CAV). Results from this study show that free-ranging maned wolves in a remote area of Bolivia have been exposed to multiple infectious and parasitic agents of domestic carnivores, including CAV, CDV, CPV, canine coronavirus, rabies virus, Leptospira interrogans spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Dirofilaria immitis, and may be at increased risk for disease due to these agents.

      The Gran Chaco, Bolivia, has a total of seven species of armadillos with the three-banded (Tolypeutes matacus) and nine-banded (Dasypus novemcinctus) the most commonly hunted by the local Isoseño-Guarani people. Armadillos are known carriers of zoonotic pathogens, including Mycobacterium leprae, Toxoplasma gondii, and Trypanosoma cruzi; thus human handling and consumption of these species may have a significant public health impact. A health assessment that included physical examinations, hematology, plasma biochemical analyses, levels of exposure to selected infectious agents, and endoparasite and ectoparasite identification was performed on nine-banded and three-banded armadillos in the Gran Chaco, Bolivia. Based on clinical findings, the general health of these armadillos was rated as good. However, many of the nine-banded armadillos (64%) had abrasions and wounds, probably related to the capture method. The blood value results from a subset of these armadillos are presented as baseline values for free-ranging populations of both these species in Bolivia. Serologic antibody tests for M. leprae were negative in three-banded (n = 8) and nine-banded (n = 2) armadillos. Three-banded armadillos were antibody positive for Eastern equine encephalitis virus (8/8; 100%) and Saint Louis encephalitis virus (5/8; 62.5%). Two of 12 (16.7%) three-banded armadillos tested were antigen positive for Dirofilaria immitis. Nine-banded armadillos were antibody positive for T. gondii (3/9; 33.3%), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (5/8; 62.5%), and T. cruzi (2/9; 22.2%). Two of eight (25%) nine-banded armadillos were antigen positive for D. immitis. A number of endo- and ectoparasites were identified in/on both species of armadillos. Results from this study support the possibility that the handling and consumption of these species by the local Isoseño-Guarani people may have a public health impact.

      Samples from 17 free-ranging hunter-killed grey brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira) in the Gran Chaco, Bolivia, were collected during June-August 1999. All 17 deer appeared to be in good condition at the time of death. Gross necropsies were performed, serum was collected for serologic evaluation of selected infectious disease agents, and feces and ectoparasites were collected for evaluation of internal and external parasites. Serologic tests were positive for antibodies against bovine respiratory syncytial virus and four Leptospira interrogans serovars, with questionable results for epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus serotypes 1 and 2. No antibodies were detected to Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina, Babesia bovis, Babesia odocoilei, bluetongue virus (serotypes 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17), bovine viral diarrhea virus, Brucella abortus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and parainfluenza-3 virus. Sixty-four percent (7/11) of the deer had endoparasites. Amblyomma spp. ticks were found on seven deer, flies of the family Hippoboscidae on six deer, and lice on six deer.

      During rabies outbreaks in cattle (paralytic rabies) in Argentina associated with the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus, rabies was observed in marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus), red brocket deer (Mazama americana), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), savanna fox (Cerdocyon thous), and great fruit-eating bat (Artibeus lituratus). Rabies could constitute a threat to the survival of marsh deer in places where they live in small groups, and infection of both great fruit-eating bats and savanna fox represent a risk for humans; both species exhibit aggressiveness and fury when infected.

      The demography and serology of a population of wild meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) were monitored from 1982 to 1984 near Pinawa, Manitoba, Canada. Serologic tests were performed on 486 samples to detect the presence of viral antibodies to 11 common murine viruses. Meadow voles showed evidence of infection with Theiler's encephalomyelitis, reovirus-type-3, ectromelia, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, adenovirus, and mouse hepatitis viruses. At times of good survival and breeding performance the population was nearly free of evidence of viral infection. During a period of severe mortality in the winter of 1982-1983, evidence of infection by Theiler's encephalomyelitis virus and reovirus-type-3 was obtained. A high prevalence of antibodies and high titers to these two viruses were characteristic of voles that were captured late in the decline in density in the spring of 1983. This association of mortality with a viral outbreak is consistent with the hypothesis that vole population declines are sometimes related to opportunistic pathogens present in the voles' biotic and social environment.

      A herpesvirus that is related to but distinct from the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV, or human herpesvirus 8) was isolated from rhesus monkeys. The sequence of 10.6 kbp from virion DNA revealed the presence of an interleukin-6 homolog similar to what is present in KSHV and a closer relatedness of the DNA polymerase and glycoprotein B reading frames to those of KSHV than to those of any other herpesvirus. This rhesus monkey herpesvirus replicated lytically and to high titers in cultured rhesus monkey fibroblasts. Antibody testing revealed a high prevalence for at least 10 years in our rhesus monkey colony and a high prevalence in two other colonies that were tested. Thus, rhesus monkeys naturally harbor a virus related to KSHV, which we have called RRV, for rhesus monkey rhadinovirus.

      Isolates of yellow fever (YF) virus from Africa (Senegambia, Central African Republic, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso) and from South America (Panama, Ecuador, Trinidad) were examined by oligonucleotide fingerprinting of the 40S genome RNA. Geographically isolated and epidemiologically unrelated viruses were very distinct. On the basis of the T1 oligonucleotide fingerprints of each isolate, four geographical variants (topotypes) of YF virus isolated within the same period of time have been established. The Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso topotypes were similar. In the Central African Republic, two variants could be found exhibiting 70 to 75% homology to one another. In South America, the three analysed strains exhibited only about 70% homology, but could be classified in the same topotype. The oligonucleotide fingerprints of the genome RNA offered a useful tool for the understanding of YF virus variability.

      Chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to human beings by Aedes genus mosquitoes. From 1972 to 1986 in Kédougou, Senegal, 178 Chikungunya virus strains were isolated from gallery forest mosquitoes, with most of them isolated from Ae. furcifer-taylori (129 strains), Ae. luteocephalus (27 strains), and Ae. dalzieli (12 strains). The characteristics of the sylvatic transmission cycle are a circulation periodicity with silent intervals that last approximately three years. Few epidemics of this disease have been reported in Senegal. The most recent one occurred in 1996 in Kaffrine where two Chikungunya virus strains were isolated from Ae. aegypti. The retrospective analysis of viral isolates from mosquitoes, wild vertebrates, and humans allowed to us to characterize Chikungunya virus transmission cycles in Senegal and to compare them with those of yellow fever virus.

      A total of 288 rabies-virus samples from 17 Latin American and Caribbean countries were reacted with an array of monoclonal antibodies. Identification of eight distinct antigenic variants among these samples permitted epidemiologic studies of the geographic distribution of different concentrations of rabies in the region and of the animal species serving as maintenance sources for rabies within a concentrated area. Two variants were broadly distributed and associated with enzootic disease in dogs and vampire bats. All isolates from cases of human rabies contained one of these two variants. Two variants had a limited distribution: an outbreak in Brazil, primarily affecting dogs and believed to be maintained by dog-to-dog transmission, and nine cases of rabies in cattle in Venezuela, animal reservoir unknown. A reservoir of rabies in insectivorous bats was identified and the associated variant was found in a rabid domestic cat. The remaining three rabies variants were found in single isolates only, but due to inference from antigenic-typing data from North American samples, were believed to be maintained by reservoirs of rabies in hoary bats, foxes, and skunks.

      Una virus (UNAV), Togaviridae family, is widely distributed in South America, where infections have been detected in mosquitoes and vertebrate hosts (humans, birds and horses). We analyzed human sera from Córdoba inhabitants aged 44 to 89 years and using a neutralization test, we found a prevalence of UNAV antibodies of 3.8% (3/79). The low titers detected suggest past infections probably acquired in rural areas of the Province of Córdoba (central Argentina). None sera were found positive for MAYV neutralizing antibodies. This is the first report of human infections by UNAV in Argentina.

      TRIM5alpha has been shown to be a major postentry determinant of the host range for gammaretroviruses and lentiviruses and, more recently, spumaviruses. However, the restrictive potential of TRIM5alpha against other retroviruses has been largely unexplored. We sought to determine whether or not Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (M-PMV), a prototype betaretrovirus isolated from rhesus macaques, was sensitive to restriction by TRIM5alpha. Cell lines from both Old World and New World primate species were screened for their susceptibility to infection by vesicular stomatitis virus G protein pseudotyped M-PMV. All of the cell lines tested that were established from Old World primates were found to be susceptible to M-PMV infection. However, fibroblasts established from three New World monkey species specifically resisted infection by this virus. Exogenously expressing TRIM5alpha from either tamarin or squirrel monkeys in permissive cell lines resulted in a block to M-PMV infection. Restriction in the resistant cell line of spider monkey origin was determined to occur at a postentry stage. However, spider monkey TRIM5alpha expression in permissive cells failed to restrict M-PMV infection, and interference with endogenous TRIM5alpha in the spider monkey fibroblasts failed to relieve the block to infectivity. Our results demonstrate that TRIM5alpha specificity extends to betaretroviruses and suggest that New World monkeys have evolved additional mechanisms to restrict the infection of at least one primate betaretrovirus.

      After an outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) infections in Slidell, Louisiana, in 2002, we detected neutralizing antibodies to WNV in 13 of 120 mammals, representing five of six species sampled. Seroprevalence was measured in opossum, Didelphis virginiana (75%, n = 8), raccoons, Procyon lotor (60%, n = 5), black rats, Rattus rattus (6%, n = 36), hispid cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus (4%, n = 24), and eastern gray squirrels, Sciurus carolinensis (2%, n = 43).

      A new herpesvirus recovered from the kidneys of mature ground squirrels (Citellus citellus) produced an effect in tissue culture cells resembling that of herpesviruses, including the formation of multinucleated syncytia and type A intranuclear inclusions. The isolate caused latent infection in the natural host, but it proved fatal for intracerebrally inoculated suckling mice and it produced pocks on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs. Electron-microscopic examination of infected cells revealed intranuclear virus particles exhibiting a size and ultrastructure characteristic of herpesviruses. The isolate was ether-resistant and a DNA nucleic acid type was inferred from observations on inhibition by fluorinated pyrimidine. This ground squirrel herpesvirus was found to be antigenically distinct from Herpesvirus hominis and from ground squirrel cytomegalovirus, with no detectable cross-reactivity.

      Tick-borne flaviviruses are among the medically most important arboviruses in Europe and Asia. Tick-borne encephalitis causes between 10,000 and 15,000 human cases every year in both continents. Besides this disease there are several other tick-borne flaviviruses which may be of local medical importance, and which are less known, but may be important as differential diagnosis. Among them are louping-ill disease which is present mainly on the British Islands, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, which is prevalent in parts of Russia, Kyasanur Forest Disease, which is distributed in parts of India, Alkhumra hemorrhagic fever, occurring in Saudi Arabia, Powassan encephalitis, which is known to be the only tick-borne flavivirus of human pathogenicity so far detected in North America and some other flaviviruses. Most of these viruses are also more or less important for veterinary medicine. Several other tick-borne flaviviruses so far have neither been associated with human nor animal diseases, and their potential pathogenicity for humans and animals is unknown. Changes in human behaviour, land use, or climate may change the actual geographical distribution and transmission intensity so that tick-borne flaviviruses are potential winners of the changing environment and may increase in medical and veterinary importance.

      Two epidemics of a new virus disease, tanapox, occurred in 1957 and 1962 among the Wapakomo tribe along the Tana River in Kenya. Several hundred people were affected by a short febrile illness with headache and prostration and the disease was characterized by a single pock-like lesion on the upper part of the body. A pox virus, unrelated to the vaccinia-variola group, has been incriminated as the causative agent. The virus has a limited host range and has been grown only in human and monkey tissue cultures, and so far the only animals that have proved susceptible in the laboratory have been monkeys. The characteristic lesions have been reproduced in a human volunteer. Histopathological and electron microscopic studies indicate that the virus belongs to the pox group, but serological tests show that it differs from other animal pox viruses, including yabapox virus of monkeys. A similar if not identical pox virus has caused epidemics in primate colonies in the U.S.A. It is suggested that tanapox is a zoonosis and that the disease is transmitted from monkeys to man in Kenya.

      Sera from cynomolgus monkeys from Malaysia, from Indian rhesus monkeys, from various species of monkeys from Africa and from South America have been examined for neutralizing antibody to Tanapox and Yaba viruses. No antibody was found to either virus in the sera of rhesus monkeys or South American monkeys. A certain proportion of sera from cynomolgus monkeys and various species of African monkey showed antibody to one or other of the viruses, but few of the positive sera showed antibody to both. The results would seem to suggest that infection with the two viruses is endemic in African and Malaysian monkeys but does not occur or is very rare in Indian rhesus and New World monkeys.

      The hepatitis B virus (HBV), family Hepadnaviridae, is one of most relevant human pathogens. HBV origins are enigmatic, and no zoonotic reservoirs are known. Here, we screened 3,080 specimens from 54 bat species representing 11 bat families for hepadnaviral DNA. Ten specimens (0.3%) from Panama and Gabon yielded unique hepadnaviruses in coancestral relation to HBV. Full genome sequencing allowed classification as three putative orthohepadnavirus species based on genome lengths (3,149-3,377 nt), presence of middle HBV surface and X-protein genes, and sequence distance criteria. Hepatic tropism in bats was shown by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. Infected livers showed histopathologic changes compatible with hepatitis. Human hepatocytes transfected with all three bat viruses cross-reacted with sera against the HBV core protein, concordant with the phylogenetic relatedness of these hepadnaviruses and HBV. One virus from Uroderma bilobatum, the tent-making bat, cross-reacted with monoclonal antibodies against the HBV antigenicity determining S domain. Up to 18.4% of bat sera contained antibodies against bat hepadnaviruses. Infectious clones were generated to study all three viruses in detail. Hepatitis D virus particles pseudotyped with surface proteins of U. bilobatum HBV, but neither of the other two viruses could infect primary human and Tupaia belangeri hepatocytes. Hepatocyte infection occurred through the human HBV receptor sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide but could not be neutralized by sera from vaccinated humans. Antihepadnaviral treatment using an approved reverse transcriptase inhibitor blocked replication of all bat hepadnaviruses. Our data suggest that bats may have been ancestral sources of primate hepadnaviruses. The observed zoonotic potential might affect concepts aimed at eradicating HBV.

      Bats may host emerging viruses, including coronaviruses (CoV). We conducted an evaluation of CoV in rhinolophid and vespertilionid bat species common in Europe. Rhinolophids carried severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related CoV at high frequencies and concentrations (26% of animals are positive; up to 2.4×10(8) copies per gram of feces), as well as two Alphacoronavirus clades, one novel and one related to the HKU2 clade. All three clades present in Miniopterus bats in China (HKU7, HKU8, and 1A related) were also present in European Miniopterus bats. An additional novel Alphacoronavirus clade (bat CoV [BtCoV]/BNM98-30) was detected in Nyctalus leisleri. A CoV grouping criterion was developed by comparing amino acid identities across an 816-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) of all accepted mammalian CoV species (RdRp-based grouping units [RGU]). Criteria for defining separate RGU in mammalian CoV were a >4.8% amino acid distance for alphacoronaviruses and a >6.3% distance for betacoronaviruses. All the above-mentioned novel clades represented independent RGU. Strict associations between CoV RGU and host bat genera were confirmed for six independent RGU represented simultaneously in China and Europe. A SARS-related virus (BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008) from a Rhinolophus blasii (Rhi bla) bat was fully sequenced. It is predicted that proteins 3b and 6 were highly divergent from those proteins in all known SARS-related CoV. Open reading frame 8 (ORF8) was surprisingly absent. Surface expression of spike and staining with sera of SARS survivors suggested low antigenic overlap with SARS CoV. However, the receptor binding domain of SARS CoV showed higher similarity with that of BtCoV/BM48-31/Bulgaria/2008 than with that of any Chinese bat-borne CoV. Critical spike domains 472 and 487 were identical and similar, respectively. This study underlines the importance of assessments of the zoonotic potential of widely distributed bat-borne CoV.

      Nelson Bay orthoreovirus (NBV) is a species in the genus Orthoreovirus, family Reoviridae, containing 4, possibly 5, members. Here, we report a putative sixth member, Xi River virus (XRV), isolated from fruit bats collected in a location near the Xi River, Guangdong Province, China. This virus showed the same electron microscopic morphology as NBV, fusogenic CPE, and a 10-segmented double-strand RNA genome, as well as high sequence identity to NBV members. It is the first bat reovirus isolated in China.

      We investigated the feasibility of using whole blood dried on paper strips as a means to collect antibody prevalence data for the epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses (EHDV) and bluetongue viruses (BTV) from hunter-harvested male mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in October 2002 from Arizona, USA. We compared antibody prevalence estimates in mule deer from paired paper strip and serum samples. Prevalence data obtained from elution of dried blood on paper strips proved to be consistent with results from serum in 94% of the samples tested. The paper strip method allows easy collection of blood from dead animals, with a smaller amount of blood being needed for analyses. Also, samples do not need to be refrigerated before analyses. We also used serum samples to determine hemorrhagic disease (HD) serotype exposure status of mule deer harvested from 4 distinct areas in Arizona. Antibodies to BTV and EHDV were identified in 3 of the 4 areas, with positive results to EHDV-1, EHDV-2, BTV-10, and BTV-11 being most common. Many animals did not have antibodies against the BTV serotypes. Exposure varied geographically and potentially with elevation. Hemorrhagic disease viruses commonly infect Arizona mule deer, except on the Kaibab Plateau in northern Arizona.

      The toroviruses, Berne virus (BEV) and Breda virus (BRV), are recognized pathogens of horses and cattle, respectively. Torovirus-like particles (TVLPs) that are immunologically related to BRV have been reported as etiological agents of gastroenteritis in humans. Of the toroviruses, only BEV has been shown to replicate in cell culture. Hence, these agents can be routinely detected only by electron microscopy (EM), although serological testing has been used as well. Our studies have provided supporting evidence that the TVLPs detected in the stool specimens of pediatric patients with gastroenteritis are human toroviruses. By EM, these particles are morphologically similar to BEV and BRV. Thin-section electron microscopy revealed that TVLPs contain toroidal-shaped nucleocapsids. Viruses purified from human fecal specimens agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes. BRV antiserum as well as convalescent sera from patients with gastroenteritis whose stools contain TVLPs were shown to contain antibodies that react with purified TVLPs as demonstrated by hemagglutination inhibition, immunoelectron microscopy, and immunoblotting. RNA extracted from partially purified TVLP preparations is amplifiable by RT-PCR using primers bracketing a 219-base region at the 3' end of the Berne virus genome. Sequence analysis of amplicons from five isolates showed a high degree of identity with the corresponding BEV sequence.

      A longitudinal study of morbillivirus infection among harbor (Phoca vitulina) and gray (Halichoerus grypus) seals on the Atlantic coast of North America was carried out between 1980 and 1994. Serology also was carried out on harbor seals from the Pacific northwest coast collected in 1992 and 1993. The prevalence of morbillivirus neutralizing antibodies was significantly (P < 0.0001) higher in gray (73%, n = 296) than in harbor seals (37%, n = 387) from the Atlantic. Titers were significantly (P < 0.0001) higher against phocine distemper (PDV) compared to any other morbillivirus. Antibodies were not detected in serum from Pacific harbor seals. During the winter of 1991 to 1992 an epizootic occurred among harbor seals on the northeast coast of the United States. The event was characterized by an increase in strandings and by a significant (P = 0.001) increase in PDV antibody prevalence to 83% (n = 36) in seals stranded that winter. Morbillivirus lesions and antigen were observed in six animals found stranded from southern Maine to Long Island, New York (USA), between November 1991 and April 1992. In addition, morbillivirus encephalitis was detected in tissues from a harbor seal that stranded in 1988. Enzootic infection appeared to be present in both seal species, although with a different prevalence of disease. We propose that enzootic infection among gray seals is facilitated by population size, high annual recruitment and innate resistance to clinical disease. Infection may be maintained in the smaller harbor seal population through casual contact with gray seals.

      A variant of variola virus is described which produces a late polypeptide of 25 kDa instead of one of 27 kDa and which has an additional endonuclease cleavage site for SalI in the viral DNA. These markers were shown to be genetically independent and to characterize 14 of the 48 variola strains which were examined. The variant strains were isolated from smallpox outbreaks originating in or from Pakistan between 1961 and 1974 and also from two cases at a Mission Hospital in Vellore, India in 1964. No variant strains were found among 9 other isolates from cases of variola major occurring in other parts of India or in Bangladesh, nor among 4 isolates from Indonesia, 15 from Africa or 6 isolates of variola minor.

      Sera obtained from 66 free-ranging Florida black bears (Ursus americanus floridanus) from three geographic areas of Florida (USA) between November 1993 and August 1995 were tested for antibodies to 13 disease agents. Antibody prevalences were 3 positive of 37 tested (8%) Coxiella burnetti, 37 of 66 (56%) Toxoplasma gondii, 3 of 61 (5%) bluetongue virus/epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (BTV/EHDV), 4 of 66 (6%) canine adenovirus-type 1, 5 of 66 (8%) canine distemper virus (CDV), 10 of 62 (16%) canine parvovirus (CPV), 7 of 66 (11%) eastern equine encephalitis virus, 4 of 66 (6%) western equine encephalitis virus, 2 of 66 (3%) Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and 11 of 66 (17%) St. Louis encephalitis virus. No samples had serologic evidence of exposure to Brucella spp. (n = 37), Francisella tularensis (n = 40), or pseudorabies virus (n = 37). This is the first known published report of antibodies to BTV/EHDV, CDV, and CPV in black bears.

      During 1996 and 1997, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted a study to determine the cause(s) of population decline and low survival of pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) fawns on Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge (HMNAR) located in southeastern Oregon (USA). As part of that study, blood, fecal, and tissue samples from 104 neonatal fawns, 40 adult does, and nine adult male pronghorns were collected to conduct a health evaluation of the population. Physiological parameters related to nutrition and/or disease were studied. No abnormalities were found in the complete blood cell counts of adults (n = 40) or fawns (n = 44 to 67). Serum total protein and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were lower compared to other pronghorn populations. Does had mean BUN values significantly lower (P < 0.001) in December 1996 than March 1997. Serum copper (Cu) levels in does (range 0.39 to 0.74 ppm) were considered marginal when compared to domestic animals and other wild ungulates. Fawns had low (0.28 ppm) Cu levels at birth and reached the does' marginal values in about 3 days. Whole blood, serum and liver selenium (Se) levels were considered marginal to low in most segments of the pronghorn population. However, serum levels of vitamin E (range 1.98 to 3.27 microg/ml), as determined from the does captured in March, were apparently sufficient to offset any signs of Se deficiency. No clinical signs of Cu or Se deficiency were observed. Fifty-five of 87 dead fawns were necropsied. Trauma, due to predation by coyotes (Canis latrans), accounted for 62% of the mortality during mid-May to mid-July of each year. Other causes included predation by golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) (4%), dystocia (2%), septicemic pasteurellosis (4%), starvation (5%), and unknown (23%). Adult females were tested for serum neutralizing antibodies to Brucella spp. (n = 20, negative), Leptospira interrogans (n = 20, negative), bluetongue virus (n = 20, 35% positive), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (n = 20, 30% positive), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 18, negative), parainfluenza virus type 3 (n = 18, 67% positive), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (n = 18, negative), and bovine viral diarrhea (n = 18, negative). Considering the parameters examined, we found no apparent predisposing factors to mortality including those killed by coyotes, but some nutritional parameters suggest that pronghorns on HMNAR exist on a diet low in protein and Se and marginal in Cu. The effect these factors have on the population is not known.

      Seventy-two strains of porcine enteroviruses including strains from North America, England, and Japan were compared by cell culture neutralization tests to provide a serological classification of North American strains. From the tests, eight serogroups evolved, with serogroup 8 having a possible three subgroups. There appeared to be some intergroup relationship among certain viruses in groups having the same specific cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell culture. There was no apparent cross-reaction between the group with type II CPE and groups with type I CPE. Antisera produced in nonhost chickens provided a satisfactory antibody source for the tests. It was proposed that satisfactory typing of viruses could be done best by cross-neutralization rather than by one-way neutralization tests. This provided the homologous serum titer as determined in the laboratory conducting the tests which was important where comparisons are made on the basis of per cent of the homologous titer. It was further emphasized that viruses of tissue origin and their antisera have fewer intergroup reactions than viruses of intestinal origin and their antisera. General type strains and specific North American strains were suggested as satisfactory type sera and viruses for seven of the eight groups to facilitate virus identification.

      DNA from one biopsy sample of invasive cancer of the cervix contained sequences hybridizing with human papillomavirus (HPV) type 11 DNA only under nonstringent conditions. This DNA was molecularly cloned in lambda phage. Under stringent conditions of hybridization it cross-hybridized to a minor extent (less than 0.1%) with HPV types 10, 14, and 15 and showed no homology with DNA of other human HPV types. We therefore propose to designate it tentatively as HPV 16. HPV 16 DNA was used as a probe to test additional cancer biopsy samples from cervical, vulval, and penile cancer, as well as benign genital warts (condylomata acuminata) and cervical dysplasias for the presence of homologous sequences. In 61.1% (11/18) of cervical cancer samples from German patients sequences were found hybridizing with HPV 16 DNA under conditions of high stringency. In contrast, only 34.8% (8/23) of cancer biopsy samples from Kenya and Brazil revealed this DNA. Vulval and penile cancer biopsy samples hybridized to 28.6% (2/7) or 25% (1/4), respectively. Only 2 out of 33 condylomata acuminata contained HPV 16 DNA. Both positive tumors harbored in addition HPV 6 or HPV 11 DNA. The data thus indicate that HPV 16 DNA prevails in malignant tumors, rendering an accidental contamination with papillomavirus DNA from adjacent papillomas rather unlikely. The rare presence in benign genital papillomas in addition to common genital papillomaviruses suggests a dependence of HPV 16 replication on helper virus.

      Laboratory tests are readily available for the diagnosis of HIV infection. These are based on the detection of HIV-specific antibodies and HIV p24 antigen in combination screening assays, followed by confirmation by Western blot. Managing established HIV infection, including the use of antiretroviral drugs, has been facilitated by the use of nucleic acid tests that measure HIV RNA load in plasma or detect mutations associated with drug resistance. Quality assurance programs ensure high-level performance of HIV assays.

      During lyssavirus surveillance, 350 brains from four species of fruit bats and one species of insectivorous bat were collected from seven locations in Northern Nigeria during May to October, 2006. Lyssavirus antigen was not detected in the brains, and isolation attempts in mice were unsuccessful. However, serologic tests demonstrated the presence of lyssavirus-neutralizing antibodies in bat sera. Of 140 sera tested, 27 (19%) neutralized Lagos bat virus, and two of these additionally neutralized Mokola virus. The positive samples originated from the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) and the Gambian epaulet bat (Epomophorus gambianus). No neutralizing activity was detected against other lyssaviruses including rabies, Duvenhage, and West Caucasian bat viruses.

      Sera from 38 free-ranging spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania, were screened for exposure to coronavirus of antigenic group 1. An immunofluorescence assay indicated high levels of exposure to coronavirus among Serengeti hyenas: 95% when considering sera with titer levels of > or = 1:10 and 74% when considering sera with titer levels of > or = 1:40. Cubs had generally lower mean titer levels than adults. Exposure among Serengeti hyenas to coronavirus was also confirmed by a serum neutralisation assay and an ELISA. Application of RT-PCR to 27 fecal samples revealed viral RNA in three samples (11%). All three positive fecal samples were from the 15 juvenile animals (<24 months of age) sampled, and none from the 12 adults sampled. No viral RNA was detected in tissue samples (lymph node, intestine, lung) from 11 individuals. Sequencing of two amplified products from the S protein gene of a positive sample revealed the presence of coronavirus specific RNA with a sequence homology to canine coronavirus of 76 and 78% and to feline coronavirus type II of 80 and 84%, respectively. Estimation of the phylogenetic relationship among coronavirus isolates indicated considerable divergence of the hyena variant from those in European, American and Japanese domestic cats and dogs. From long-term observations of several hundred known individuals, the only clinical sign in hyenas consistent with those described for coronavirus infections in dogs and cats was diarrhea. There was no evidence that coronavirus infection in hyenas caused clinical signs similar to feline infectious peritonitis in domestic cats or was a direct cause of mortality in hyenas. To our knowledge, this is the first report of coronavirus infection in Hyaenidae.

      Unintentional infection of laboratory rodents can compromise scientific research as well as the health of the animals and animal handlers. The source of contamination often is unknown, but may be introduced by wild rats from surrounding environments. To determine whether rats in Baltimore, Maryland, USA carry infectious agents commonly found in laboratory rodent colonies, we live-trapped 162 rats during 2005 to 2006 and screened them for a panel of viruses, bacteria and parasites. Antibodies against rat coronavirus/sialodacryoadenitis virus (91.7%), Mycoplasma pulmonis (72.9%), cilia-associated respiratory bacillus (52.1%), rat parvovirus/rat minute virus (29.2%), Kilham rat virus (10.4%), Toolan's H-1 virus (10.4%), Sendai virus (4.2%) and Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus (4.2%), were detected in wild-caught Norway rats. Antibodies against reovirus and pneumonia virus of mice were not detected in wild Norway rats. Endoparasites, including Nippostrongylus braziliensis (71.6%), Rodentolepis nana or Hymenolepis diminuta (34.4%), Hetarakis spumosa (24.1%) and Trichuris muris (14.8%), as well as ectoparasites (14.8%), were identified in wild-caught rats. The risk of pathogen transmission from wild-caught rats to laboratory colonies needs to be mitigated by minimizing exposures rather than assuming wild animals represent a minimal hazard.

      The prevalence of Herpesvirus papio 2 (HVP2) in several groups of captive and wild-caught baboons was determined by detection of anti-HVP2 antibodies in 133 sera of adult baboons. Over 90% of newly imported (wild-caught) adult olive baboons (Papio anubis) from Kenya and chacma baboons (P. ursinus) from South Africa were found to have anti-HVP2 titers. Similarly, approximately 85% of captive breeding colony baboons (P. anubis and P. cynocephalus) were seropositive for HVP2. Infected animals were generally easily identifiable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay because anti-HVP2 IgG titers in immune animals were usually high (16,000 to 64,000). There was little variation in the relative reactivity patterns of individual HVP2-immune sera when tested against herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, monkey B virus, H. cercopithecus 2, and HVP2, or against different HVP2 strains. Also, differences were not detected between reactivity of olive and chacma baboon immune sera. Analysis of the polypeptide specificity of immune sera by western blot identified four viral antigens that were consistent targets of immune sera. These antigens were the gB glycoprotein, a pair of unidentified glycoproteins of 80 to 100 kDa, the gD glycoprotein, and a series of smaller capsid proteins. Additional viral proteins were variably recognized by individual immune sera. The results of this study indicate that HVP2 is a common infection of baboons; there is little antigenic variation among HVP2 strains; and there are several HVP2 antigens that represent consistent targets of the anti-HVP2 immune response of baboons.

      An association exists between verrucae presenting with specific histological features and the type of HPV inducing the lesion. An HPV 1 induced lesion is associated with a granular type of intracytoplasmic inclusion body (Gr-ICB), whereas HPV 4 is associated with the homogeneous type of ICB (Hg-ICB). A third type of inclusion body, a filamentous type (F1-ICB), was found to be present in multiple punctate keratotic lesions. A novel type of papillomavirus, HPV 63, was present in such lesions. After cloning, characterization and sequencing of its DNA genome, HPV 63, although still very distinct (< 66% nucleotide homology), could be grouped with HPV 1. Upon histological examination of verrucous lesions presenting clinically with grey to black pigmentation, the Hg-ICB present were very characteristic. These lesions were infected with HPV 4, HPV 60, or HPV 65. The majority of the lesions contained the novel type HPV 65. This viral DNA was isolated and characterized. Its DNA sequence has an 83% homology to that of HPV 4, whereas both are more distantly related to HPV 60, an HPV isolated from an epidermoid cyst.

      Rodent herpesviruses such as murine cytomegalovirus (host, Mus musculus), rat cytomegalovirus (host, Rattus norvegicus), and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (hosts, Apodemus species) are important tools for the experimental study of human herpesvirus diseases. However, alphaherpesviruses, roseoloviruses, and lymphocryptoviruses, as well as rhadinoviruses, that naturally infect Mus musculus (house mouse) and other Old World mice are unknown. To identify hitherto-unknown rodent-associated herpesviruses, we captured M. musculus, R. norvegicus, and 14 other rodent species in several locations in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Thailand. Samples of trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, brains, spleens, and other organs, as well as blood, were analyzed with a degenerate panherpesvirus PCR targeting the DNA polymerase (DPOL) gene. Herpesvirus-positive samples were subjected to a second degenerate PCR targeting the glycoprotein B (gB) gene. The sequences located between the partial DPOL and gB sequences were amplified by long-distance PCR and sequenced, resulting in a contiguous sequence of approximately 3.5 kbp. By DPOL PCR, we detected 17 novel betaherpesviruses and 21 novel gammaherpesviruses but no alphaherpesvirus. Of these 38 novel herpesviruses, 14 were successfully analyzed by the complete bigenic approach. Most importantly, the first gammaherpesvirus of Mus musculus was discovered (Mus musculus rhadinovirus 1 [MmusRHV1]). This virus is a member of a novel group of rodent gammaherpesviruses, which is clearly distinct from murine herpesvirus 68-like rodent gammaherpesviruses. Multigenic phylogenetic analysis, using an 8-kbp locus, revealed that MmusRHV1 diverged from the other gammaherpesviruses soon after the evolutionary separation of Epstein-Barr virus-like lymphocryptoviruses from human herpesvirus 8-like rhadinoviruses and alcelaphine herpesvirus 1-like macaviruses.

      Both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques have been used as animal models for measles vaccination and immunopathogenesis studies. A number of studies have suggested that experimental measles virus (MV) infection induces more-characteristic clinical features in rhesus than in cynomolgus monkeys. In the present study, both macaque species were infected with two different wild-type MV strains and clinical, virological and immunological parameters were compared. The viruses used were a genotype C2 virus isolated in The Netherlands in 1991 (MV-Bil) and a genotype B3 virus isolated from a severe measles case in Sudan in 1997 (MV-Sudan). Following infection, all rhesus monkeys developed a skin rash and conjunctivitis, which were less obvious in cynomolgus monkeys. Fever was either mild or absent in both species. Virus reisolation profiles from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and broncho-alveolar lavage cells and the kinetics of MV-specific IgM and IgG responses were largely identical in the two animal species. However, in animals infected with MV-Sudan, viraemia appeared earlier and lasted longer than in animals infected with MV-Bil. This was also reflected by the earlier appearance of MV-specific serum IgM antibodies after infection with MV-Sudan. Collectively, these data show that cynomolgus and rhesus macaques are equally susceptible to wild-type MV infection, although infection in the skin seems to follow a different course in rhesus macaques. MV-Sudan proved more pathogenic for non-human primates than MV-Bil, which may render it more suitable for use in future pathogenesis studies.

      A serologic survey was conducted to determine the presence of antibody to Hantavirus in rodents in Thailand. Sera from over 300 rodents were tested by an immunofluorescent antibody method. Bandicota indica, a field rodent, was found to have a high incidence of infection (20-24%) in 2 locations. A Hantavirus was isolated from lung samples of B. indica. When sera were tested from humans living in Kanchanaburi and several locations in Bangkok, those people living in close proximity to the infected B. indica had greater than 30% prevalence of positive antibody titers.

      By the end of March 2002, a collection of some 200 gazelles, kept under semi range conditions in Saudi Arabia, was hit by a highly fatal peracute disease. The morbidity rate was 51% while the case mortality rate was 100%. Clinico-pathological and virological investigations were carried out. A virus was isolated from the ailing gazelles which was identified as Peste des Petits Ruminants virus (PPRV). Epidemiology of the disease in the Arabian peninsula is discussed.

      Main Drain virus, which is thought to be transmitted normally among rabbits and various rodents by its natural vector, Culicoides variipennis, was isolated repeatedly from brain tissue of a sick horse from Sacramento County, California, and was implicated as the causative agent. Signs of illness were incoordination and ataxia, stiff neck, head pressing, inability to swallow, fever, and tachycardia.

      Most studies that investigate the prevalence of infections with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are based on the detection of p27 antigen in blood, but they do not detect proviral DNA to identify the prevalence of regressive FeLV infections. The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and status of FeLV infection in cats in Southern Germany. P27 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), anti-p45 antibody ELISA, DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of blood and RNA PCR of saliva were performed. Nine out of 495 cats were progressively (persistently) infected (1.8%) and six were regressively (latently) infected (1.2%). Cats with regressive infections are defined as cats that have been able to overcome antigenemia but provirus can be detected by PCR. Twenty-two unvaccinated cats likely had abortive infections (regressor cats), testing FeLV antigen- and provirus-negative but anti-p45 antibody-positive. Most of the FeLV-vaccinated cats did not have anti-FeLV antibodies. Both progressive, as well as regressive infections seem to be rare in Germany today.

      Bats are known reservoirs of viral zoonoses. We report genetic characterization of a bat rotavirus (Bat/KE4852/07) detected in the feces of a straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum). Six bat rotavirus genes (viral protein [VP] 2, VP6, VP7, nonstructural protein [NSP] 2, NSP3, and NSP5) shared ancestry with other mammalian rotaviruses but were distantly related. The VP4 gene was nearly identical to that of human P[6] rotavirus strains, and the NSP4 gene was closely related to those of previously described mammalian rotaviruses, including human strains. Analysis of partial sequence of the VP1 gene indicated that it was distinct from cognate genes of other rotaviruses. No sequences were obtained for the VP3 and NSP1 genes of the bat rotavirus. This rotavirus was designated G25-P[6]-I15-R8(provisional)-C8-Mx-Ax-N8-T11-E2-H10. Results suggest that several reassortment events have occurred between human, animal, and bat rotaviruses. Several additional rotavirus strains were detected in bats.

      Although cowpox virus (CPXV) infections in a variety of dead-end hosts have been investigated in Germany for more than 50 years, data on species and geographical distribution of CPXV in reservoir hosts are sparse. Here we present the first comprehensive study of 825 rodents that have been collected in Bavaria, Southern Germany. In summary, six different rodent species (Apodemus flavicollis, Myodes glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus agrestis, and Arvicola amphibius) were trapped at three main trapping sites and investigated using a serum neutralization test (SNT). Prevalence of orthopox virus (OPV)-neutralizing antibodies was (with exception of one trapping site) highest in bank voles, ranging from 24.5% to 42.4%; often with SNT titers > or =96. Two up to 25% of yellow-necked mice were OPV sero-positive, but wood mice only at one site with 5.5%. Up to 7.7% of common voles were found to be OPV seroreactive, while M. agrestis and A. amphibius only sporadically showed seroreactivity. Further analyses of a subset of 450 bank voles and yellow-necked mice trapped at one site over a 18-month period revealed that male yellow-necked mice and female gravid yellow-necked mice had significantly more OPV-neutralizing antibodies. Mean body weight and OPV-seroreactivity were significantly negatively associated in male A. flavicollis. This was not due to shorter body length or smaller body mass index, but previously OPV-infected male A. flavicollis had dramatically reduced mean kidney weights. Seroreactivity in female bank voles was positively related to lung weights. We also found that both male yellow-necked mice and male bank voles with positive SNT titers had higher infestation rates with ectoparasites. We here show for the first time that A. flavicollis beside M. glareolus is a hypothetic host for CPXV, and that there are big geographical and spatial variations concerning the seroprevalence in rodent populations in South Germany.

      NF-kappaB comprises a family of transcription factors that regulate key immune processes. In this study, the effects of orthopoxvirus infection upon the activation of NF-kappaB were examined. During the early phase of infection, cowpox virus can inhibit the induction of NF-kappaB-regulated gene expression by interfering with the process of IkappaBalpha degradation. Although either okadaic acid or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) treatment of infected cells can induce IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, further processing of IkappaBalpha is inhibited. These results suggest that cowpox virus is capable of inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB at a point where multiple signal transduction pathways converge. Other orthopoxviruses affect NF-kappaB activity, but in a type-specific manner. Raccoonpox virus and vaccinia virus (Copenhagen strain) negatively affect NF-kappaB induction by TNF. In contrast, the modified vaccinia virus Ankara strain induces NF-kappaB activation, even in the absence of other stimuli. These findings suggest that orthopoxviruses may affect a broad range of virus-host interactions through their effects upon NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, because of the central role for NF-kappaB in immune processes and disease, these type-specific effects may contribute significantly to the immunogenic and pathogenic properties of poxviruses.

      Ectromelia virus (ECTV) is an orthopoxvirus whose natural host is the mouse; it is related closely to Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, and Monkeypox virus, the cause of an emerging zoonosis. The recent sequencing of its genome, along with an effective animal model, makes ECTV an attractive model for the study of poxvirus pathogenesis, antiviral and vaccine testing and viral immune and inflammatory responses. This review discusses the pathogenesis of mousepox, modulation of the immune response by the virus and the cytokine and cellular components of the skin and systemic immune system that are critical to recovery from infection.

      Arboviruses are important zoonotic agents with complex transmission cycles and are not well understood because they may involve many vectors and hosts. We studied sympatric wild mammals and hematophagous mosquitoes having the potential to act as hosts and vectors in two areas of southern Mexico. Mosquitoes, bats, and rodents were captured in Calakmul (Campeche) and Montes Azules (Chiapas), between November 2010 and August 2011. Spleen samples from 146 bats and 14 rodents were tested for molecular evidence of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), and West Nile virus (WNV) using PCR protocols. Bat ( Artibeus lituratus , Carollia sowelli , Glossophaga soricina , and Sturnira parvidens) and rodent ( Sigmodon hispidus and Oryzomys alfaroi ) species were positive for VEEV. No individuals were positive for WNV, EEEV, or WEEV. A total of 1,298 mosquitoes were collected at the same sites, and five of the mosquito species collected were known VEEV vectors (Aedes fulvus, Mansonia indubitans, Psorophora ferox, Psorophora cilipes, and Psorophora confinnis). This survey simultaneously presents the first molecular evidence, to our knowledge, of VEEV in bats and rodents from southern Mexico and the identification of potential sympatric vectors. Studies investigating sympatric nonhuman hosts, vectors, and arboviruses must be expanded to determine arboviral dynamics in complex systems in which outbreaks of emerging and reemerging zoonoses are continuously occurring.

      Puma lentivirus (PLV) antibodies were detected in 13 (25%) of 52 serum samples obtained from cougars (Felis concolor) collected by hunters. The serum samples were collected from November 1993 through January 1994 from four specific regions throughout the state of Washington (USA), and included the Olympic Mountains, the Cascade Mountains, the Blue Mountains, and the Selkirk Mountains. More (38%) seropositive cougar samples originated from the Cascade Mountains than from any other site. The overall seroprevalence for PLV infection in Washington cougars was higher than previously reported for cougars sampled in Oregon and Idaho (USA), but lower than in cougars sampled in Arizona, Colorado, and California (USA).

      Biologically speaking, Sendai virus (SeV), the murine parainfluenza virus type 1, is perceived as a common respiratory pathogen that is endemic in many rodent colonies throughout the world. Currently it is believed that SeV is the leading cause of pneumonia in mice and together with the mouse hepatitis viruses, is the most prevalent and important of the naturally occurring infections of mice. The scientific community also considers SeV as the archetype organism of the Paramyxoviridae family because most of the basic biochemical, molecular and biologic properties of the whole family were derived from its own characteristics. Recently, scientific interest for this old pathogen has re-emerged, this time because of its potential value as a vector for gene transfer. This review aimed at drawing an exhaustive picture of this multifaceted pathogen.

      Noroviruses (NVs) are important human pathogens that cause acute gastroenteritis. Genetically related animal enteric NVs have also been described, but there is no evidence of interspecies transmission of NVs. In this study we characterized antibody prevalence among domestic pigs by using recombinant capsid antigens of two human NVs (Norwalk and Hawaii) and one swine NV (SW918) that is genetically related to GII human NVs. Recombinant SW918 capsid protein expressed in baculovirus self-assembled into virus-like particles (VLPs) that were detected by antibodies against GII (Hawaii and Mexico), but not GI (Norwalk and VA115), human NVs. NVs recognize human histo-blood group antigens as receptors, but SW918 VLPs did not bind to human saliva samples with major histo-blood group types. Seventy-eight of 110 (71%) pig serum samples from the United States and 95 of 266 (36%) pig serum samples from Japan possessed antibodies against SW918. Serum samples from pigs in the United States were also tested for antibodies against human NVs; 63% were positive for Norwalk virus (GI) and 52% for Hawaii virus (GII). These results indicate that NV infections are common among domestic pigs; the finding of antigenic relationships between SW918 and human NVs and the detection of antibodies against both GI and GII human NVs in domestic animals highlights the importance of further studies on NV gastroenteritis as a possible zoonotic disease.

      Animal and human rabies samples isolated between 1989 and 2000 were typified by means of a monoclonal antibody panel against the viral nucleoprotein. The panel had been previously established to study the molecular epidemiology of rabies virus in the Americas. Samples were isolated in the Diagnostic Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute and in other rabies diagnostic centers in Brazil. In addition to the fixed virus samples CVS-31/96-IP, preserved in mouse brain, and PV-BHK/97, preserved in cell culture, a total of 330 rabies virus samples were isolated from dogs, cats, cattle, horses, bats, sheep, goat, swine, foxes, marmosets, coati and humans. Six antigenic variants that were compatible with the pre-established monoclonal antibodies panel were defined: numbers 2 (dog), 3 (Desmodus rotundus), 4 (Tadarida brasiliensis), 5 (vampire bat from Venezuela), 6 (Lasiurus cinereus) and Lab (reacted to all used antibodies). Six unknown profiles, not compatible with the panel, were also found. Samples isolated from insectivore bats showed the greatest variability and the most commonly isolated variant was variant-3 (Desmodus rotundus). These findings may be related to the existence of multiple independent transmission cycles, involving different bat species.

      The recent identification of antibody to hepatitis E virus (HEV) in pigs, sheep, and cattle and characterization of an HEV isolated from domestic pigs suggest animal reservoirs for this virus. To investigate whether rodents might be a natural reservoir of HEV, the prevalence of anti-HEV was determined among a variety of species throughout the United States. Serum samples were obtained from 806 rodents of 26 species in 15 genera. Anti-HEV prevalence was assessed by 2 EIAs (mosaic protein- and 55-kDa protein-based), which gave concordant results. The highest prevalence of antibody was found in the genus Rattus (59.7%; 166/278). Overall, rodents from urban habitats had a significantly higher prevalence of anti-HEV than did animals captured from rural areas. A high prevalence of anti-HEV was found in animals captured on mainland versus barrier islands. The results from this study provide convincing evidence of widespread HEV or HEV-like infection in rodents of the United States.

      The genomes of two new human papillomavirus (HPV) types, named HPV54 and HPV55, were cloned from penile lesions of 2 patients. HPV54 was isolated from a verrucous carcinoma (Buschke-Löwenstein tumour) together with full-length HPV6 genomes and HPV6 DNA molecules with a deletion of about 0.3 kb located in the non-coding region. HPV55 was isolated from a condyloma acuminatum. No cross-hybridization was observed between HPV54 DNA and the DNAs of the known cutaneous and genital HPVs by blot hybridization experiments performed under stringent conditions. In contrast, significant cross-hybridization was detected between HPV55 DNA and the DNA of HPV13, associated with benign oral lesions, and, to a lesser extent, with the DNAs of HPV6, 11, and 44, associated with benign genital proliferative lesions. The DNA sequence homology between HPV55 and HPV6, 11, and 13 was estimated at 12%, 12%, and 20%, respectively, by hybridization in liquid phase at saturation, followed by nuclease S1 analysis. The physical maps of HPV54 and 55 were aligned with the genetic maps of HPV16 and 11, respectively, by heteroduplex mapping and partial DNA sequencing. HPV54 is thus only weakly related to the known HPVs, while HPV55 represents an additional HPV6-related HPV type. HPV54 and HPV55 are uncommon genital HPV types since, in a survey of a large series of specimens of benign, pre-malignant or malignant anogenital and orolaryngeal tumours, HPV54 was not detected, and HPV55 was found in another case of condyloma acuminatum.

      Since 2001 several outbreaks of a new disease associated with Border disease virus (BDV) infection have caused important declines in Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) populations in the Pyrenees. The goal of this study was to analyze the post-outbreak BDV epidemiology in the first two areas affected by disease with the aim to establish if the infection has become endemic. We also investigated if BDV infected wild and domestic ruminants sharing habitat with chamois. Unexpectedly, we found different epidemiological scenarios in each population. Since the disease outbreaks, some chamois populations recuperated quickly, while others did not recover as expected. In chamois from the first areas, prevalence was high (73.47%) and constant throughout the whole study period and did not differ between chamois born before and after the BDV outbreak; in all, BDV was detected by RT-PCR in six chamois. In the other areas, prevalence was lower (52.79%) and decreased during the study period; as well, prevalence was significantly lower in chamois born after the disease outbreak. No BDV were detected in this population. A comparative virus neutralisation test performed with four BDV strains and one Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) strain showed that all the chamois had BDV-specific antibodies. Pestivirus antibodies were detected in all the rest of analyzed species, with low prevalence values in wild ruminants and moderate values in domestic ruminants. No viruses were detected in these species. These results confirm the hypothesis that outbreaks of BDV infection only affect the Pyrenean chamois, although other wild ruminants can occasionally be infected. In conclusion, two different scenarios have appeared since the first border disease outbreaks in Pyrenean chamois: on the one hand frequent BDV circulation with possible negative impact on population dynamics in some areas and on the other, lack of virus circulation and quick recovery of the chamois population.

      Based on empiric surveillance data, the incidence of human Lassa fever (LF) cases in Guinea and other West African countries has been reported to increase during the dry season compared to the rainy season. To investigate possible links with the ecology of the rodent reservoir of the virus, we conducted a 2-year longitudinal survey of Mastomys natalensis in a region of high human Lassa virus (LASV) seropositivity in Guinea. Standardized rodent trapping with similar trapping efforts between seasons was performed in three villages and 53.5% (601/1123) of the animals were identified as M. natalensis using morphometric and molecular criteria. Mean trapping success (TS) of M. natalensis was always higher inside houses than in proximal cultivations. In the dry season, mean TS increased 2-fold inside houses and decreased up to 10-fold outside (p < 0.0001), suggesting aggregation of rodents inside houses due to restricted food supply. 14.5% (80/553) of M. natalensis were tested positive for Lassa virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR; range, 5%-30%) and prevalence of the virus was two to three times higher in rodents captured in the rainy season than in the dry season (p < 0.05). Inside houses, however, the LASV prevalence fluctuated nonsignificantly with season. These data suggest that in Guinea the risk of LASV transmission from rodents to humans is present both in the rainy and the dry season, reflected by the occurrence of LF cases throughout the year. In the dry season, however, the increased risk of humans encountering Mastomys and their excreta inside of houses may result in an increase of human Lassa fever cases.

      Five species of Bolivian carnivores, including nine Geoffroy's cats (Oncifelis geoffroyi), ten ocelots (Leopardus pardalis), one jaguarundi (Herpailurus yaguarondi), nine pampas foxes (Pseudalopex gymnocercus), and five crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) were sampled between March 2001 and April 2005 and tested for antibodies to common pathogens of domestic carnivores. Carnivores were trapped in three areas: a village, the region between human settlements and a protected area, and within Kaa-Iya National Park, Bolivia. Antibodies to canine distemper virus were detected in ocelots and pampas foxes. Antibodies to canine parvovirus were detected in pampas foxes and crab-eating foxes. Geoffroy's cats and all of the ocelots tested positive for antibodies to feline calicivirus (FCV), while fewer than half of Geoffroy's cats and no ocelots had antibodies to feline panleukopenia (FPV). These results confirm that these species of Bolivian carnivores are not naïve to common pathogens of domestic carnivores, and seropositive animals were found in villages as well as in the national park.

      Two hundred and eighty one serum samples collected from free-ranging black (Diceros bicornis) and white (Ceratotherium simum) rhinoceros, in the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Namibia, and Kenya from 1987-97, were examined for antibody to 16 different infectious agents. Positive antibody titers were detected against Akabane (59.8%), bluetongue (55%), African horse sickness (27.9%), epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer (19.4%), parainfluenza type 3 (25.3%), bovine herpes virus 1 (3.1%), equine herpes virus 1 (8.8%) and bovine viral diarrhea (1.2%) viruses, and four serovars of Leptospira interrogans, (ranging 1.2 to 8.8%). No antibody was detected against Rift Valley fever virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, Brucella abortus, and Trypanosoma equiperdum. Interspecies differences were detected for African horse sickness, epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer and parainfluenza type 3 viruses. There appeared to be some geographic variation in the prevalence of antibody for African horse sickness, bluetongue, epizootic haemorrhagic disease of deer, parainfluenza type 3, equine herpes virus 1 and Leptospira interrogans serovar bratislava.

      Seventeen species of mammals and seven species of birds from Ossabaw Island, Georgia, were tested for vesicular stomatitis (VS) neutralizing antibodies. Seropositive results were restricted to mammals with six of 17 species testing seropositive for VS (New Jersey type) neutralizing antibodies. Seropositive species included: raccoons (Procyon lotor), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), feral swine (Sus scrofa), cattle (Bos taurus), horses (Equus caballus), and donkeys (Equus asinus). All tests for VS (Indiana type) were negative.

      For the first time in West Africa, arboviruses were isolated from phlebotomine sand fly pools. One strain of Chandipura virus (a Vesiculovirus), four strains of Saboya virus (a Flavivirus), and one strain of a not yet identified virus were isolated. Three hundred twenty-two pools were established from a population of 33,917 sand flies caught in CO2 light traps in the Ferlo Sahelian region of Senegal from November 1991 to December 1992. This is the first isolation of Chandipura virus from any arthropod in Africa. Saboya virus has already been isolated from small rodents in Senegal; thus, its transmission cycle probably involves rodentophilic sand flies. No strain of Rift Valley fever phlebovirus, which caused an epizootic in this region in 1987, was isolated. During the same time at the same site, 11 sand fly species were identified from 4,191 specimens caught on sticky traps, including Phlebotomus duboscqi, a leishmaniasis vector.

      In Europe, two bat lyssaviruses referred to as European bat lyssaviruses (EBLVs) types 1 and 2 (genotypes 5 and 6 respectively) which are closely related to classical rabies virus are responsible for an emerging zoonosis. EBLVs are host restricted to bats, and have been known to infect not only their primary hosts but also in rare circumstances, induce spillover infections to terrestrial mammals including domestic livestock, wildlife and man. Although spillover infections have occurred, there has been no evidence that the virus adapted to a new host. Since 1977, four human deaths from EBLVs have been reported. None of them had a record of prophylactic rabies immunization. Only fragmentary data exist about the effectiveness of current vaccines in cross-protection against EBLVs. It is clear that EBLV in bats cannot be eliminated using conventional strategies similar to the control programmes based on vaccine baits used for fox rabies in Europe during the 1980s. Due to the protected status of bats in Europe, our knowledge of EBLV prevalence and epidemiology is limited. It is possible that EBLV is under-reported and that the recorded cases of EBLV represent only a small proportion of the actual number of infected bats. For this reason, any interaction between man and bats in Europe must be considered as a possible exposure. Human exposure through biting incidents, especially unprovoked attacks, should be treated immediately with rabies post-exposure treatment and the bat, where possible, retained for laboratory analysis. Preventative measures include educating all bat handlers of the risks posed by rabies-infected animals and advising them to be immunized. This review provides a brief history of EBLVs, their distribution in host species and the public health risks.

      An outbreak of Ebola in nature is described for the first time. During a few weeks in November 1994, approximately 25% of 43 members of a wild chimpanzee community disappeared or were found dead in the Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. A retrospective cohort study was done on the chimpanzee community. Laboratory procedures included histology, immunohistochemistry, bacteriology, and serology. Ebola-specific immunohistochemical staining was positive for autopsy tissue sections from 1 chimpanzee. Demographic, epidemiologic, and ecologic investigations were compatible with a point-source epidemic. Contact activities associated with a case (e.g., touching dead bodies or grooming) did not constitute significant risk factors, whereas consumption of meat did. The relative risk of meat consumption was 5.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-21.1). A similar outbreak occurred in November 1992 among the same community. A high mortality rate among apes tends to indicate that they are not the reservoir for the disease causing the illness. These points will have to be investigated by additional studies.

      Between 1992 and 1993, a serological survey was conducted in Côte d'Ivoire on 623 sera from sheep, 215 sera from cattle and 211 sera from wild herbivores. These sera were tested for bluetongue virus (BTV) antibodies using an agar gel immunodiffusion test. The purpose of this survey was twofold: to establish the incidence of bluetongue in the country, and to analyse the putative role of BTV in the reproductive pathology of sheep. Seroprevalence was 52 +/- 4% in sheep, 95 +/- 3% in cattle, and 56 +/- 7% in wild herbivores. The authors found antibodies against BTV in kob (Kobus kob Erxleben, 1777), common waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus Ogilby, 1833), roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus Desmarest, 1804), buffalo (Syncerus caffer Sparrman, 1779), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus Pallas, 1766) and elephant (Loxodonta africana Blumenbach, 1797). A significant difference was found in seroprevalence in sheep between the three areas covered by the survey. Antibody prevalence increased significantly with age in sheep and wild herbivores, and seroprevalence was higher in dams with a history of abortion. It can therefore be concluded that bluetongue is enzootic in Côte d'Ivoire.

      During a case control study undertaken in 2006-2007, a screening and consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to evaluate the potential role of equid herpesviruses (EHV) in several occurrences of respiratory disorders in 661 horses. Of 785 bronchoalveolar or tracheal lavage fluid samples submitted for analysis, 20 were positive for EHV-5 DNA by sequential analysis of the consensus PCR product. Nineteen of those samples were confirmed using a specific EHV-5 PCR. No particular changes in cytological profile could be associated with the detection of EHV-5 in contrast to suggestions in previous reports of natural or experimental respiratory viral infections in horses or ponies. This is the first description of EHV-5 isolation in equine respiratory fluids in Europe, but further investigations are needed to determine the potential pathogenic role of this gammaherpesvirus in the horse.

      Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) have recently been classified into the Picobirnaviridae family. They are small, non-enveloped viruses with bisegmented, double-stranded (ds) RNA genomes. Although they are found in the feces of a broad range of hosts, information regarding their genomes is limited to viruses detected from humans, rabbits, and porcine. Identification of PBVs has been done using PAGE and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). In this study, we present a phylogenetic analysis of PBVs detected in the feces of dogs, snakes, and rats. In addition, we compare these strains to those from human and porcine hosts. To do so, 487 fecal specimens from dogs, snakes and rats were analyzed by PAGE. The positive specimens for PBV were tested by RT-PCR using primers for genogroup I of the PBVs. From the 11 genogroup I PBV samples, at least one from each host was sequenced and submitted for phylogenetic analysis. All of the sequences showed high homology with the human and porcine genogroup I PBV sequences. In this study we report the first detection of PBVs in snakes (8.5%). We also report a phylogenetic analysis that goes beyond humans and pigs to include dogs, rats, and snakes. However, more hosts must be included in the analysis so that we may reach better conclusions regarding the spread of these viruses.

      A virus of the pox group was isolated from a lesion on a patient with milker's nodules by use of tissue cultures of bovine cells. The virus shows marked biologic and serologic differences from vaccinia virus, and it is presumably the etiologic agent of the milker's nodule syndrome.

      Canine distemper virus (CDV) infects a broad range of carnivores. To assess whether wild carnivores may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV in domestic dogs in Germany, the seroprevalence of CDV was determined. In sera from red foxes (30 of 591 (5%)) and stone martens (2 of 10 (20%)) antiviral antibodies were detected using a neutralization assay, whereas sera of raccoons, two mink, one pine marten and one raccoon dog were negative. In foxes, there was a significantly higher prevalence in urban and suburban compared to rural regions. When testing lung and spleen tissue samples (fox, badger, stone marten, polecat, raccoon dog) 13 of 253 (5.1%) foxes, 2 of 13 (15.4%) stone martens and 2 of 6 (33%) badgers were virus positive using RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial sequences of the F gene revealed a distinct relatedness to canine CDV isolates. Together, the data support the concept of transmission of CDV between domestic dogs and wild carnivores.

      A total of 294 sera collected between 1999 and 2001 from eight captive and one free-ranging herds of Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx) distributed in Saudi Arabia (SA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were assayed for antibodies against 13 selected viral agents. Arabian oryx have been exposed to bluetongue virus (BTV), epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), rinderpest virus (RPV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine adenovirus 3 (BAV-3), cervid herpesvirus-1, foot-and-mouth disease virus, equine herpesvirus 9, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. The high seroprevalence to BTV and EHDV in the UAE and SA indicates that Arabian oryx are likely to be susceptible to infection by these viruses and therefore could act as a source of virus to vectors during the infective stage of infection. Moreover, antibodies were detected against RPV and BRSV in sera from SA and against BAV-3 in sera from the UAE. No antibodies were found against bovine herpesvirus-1, caprine herpesvirus-1, enzootic bovine leucosis virus, and peste des petits ruminants virus. On the basis of these results, caution should be applied when considering translocation of Arabian oryx, and only those proven to be free of infectious agents that might present a risk to other species should be moved.

      A total of 164 blood samples, collected from free-ranging red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) in six German national parks (NP) between 2000 and 2002, were assayed for antibodies against nine viral disease agents. Antibodies were only detected against the alpha-herpesviruses; specifically, bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) (22 of 157, 14%), cervid herpesvirus-1 (17 of 157, 10.8%), and caprine herpesvirus-1 (11 of 159, 6.9%). Titers ranged from 4 to 102. Most of the seropositive sera, and those with the highest antibody titers, were from red and roe deer in the Harz and Hochharz NP, which are connected and allow migration between the two. The distribution and specificity of antibodies detected in individual deer suggests that the three alpha-herpesviruses are circulating in these deer populations. No antibodies were detected against bovine viral diarrhea virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, bovine leukemia virus, bluetongue virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, or sheep and goat poxvirus.

      Fuentes-Marins, R. (Southwest Foundation for Research and Education, San Antonio, Texas), A. R. Rodriguez, S. S. Kalter, A. Hellman, and R. A. Crandell. Isolation of enteroviruses from the ""normal"" baboon (Papio doguera). J. Bacteriol. 85: 1045-1050. 1963.-In a study designed to determine whether the baboon (Papio doguera) would be suitable for use as a model of human virus infections, the normal enterovirus flora was determined. Five agents were isolated from 101 stool samples: four from the African group and one from the African-African group. None of the stool samples from the Domestic group of animals was found to contain any agents. On the basis of their biological characterizations (animal source, cytopathic effect, plaque formation, and antigenic relationships), the isolates were separated into two groups. Accordingly, prototype strains AA153 and A13 were designated for the African-African and African groups, respectively. These viruses have not been found to be related to any known human viruses. Their relationship to organisms isolated from other animals, especially primates, awaits study. The failure to detect latent viruses in preparations of baboon kidney cell cultures suggests a relatively ""clean"" animal which may be used with safety in preparation of vaccine for human administration.

      For proper management and conservation of the Kuril harbor seal (Phoca vitulina stejnegeri) through disease control, serological analysis was performed for influenza A virus infection in free-ranging seals in Hokkaido, Japan. Serum samples were collected from seals at Nosappu (231 seals), Akkeshi (16) and Erimo (75), between 1998 and 2005, and were analyzed by ELISA. Antibodies to the influenza A virus were detected only in seals from Nosappu. The incidences were 11% (1/9), 3% (2/66), 12% (7/59) and 6% (5/77) in 1998, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. These suggest sporadic infection. Because antibody-positive seals included juvenile seals in each year, the infections were considered to have been circulated since no later than the late 1990s until recent years. ELISA-positive sera were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests to determine the subtypes. Antibodies to the H3 and H6 subtypes were detected in 10 and 2 sera, respectively. Two of the sera that had antibodies to the H6 subtype also had antibodies to the H3 subtype. These two seals were considered to have been infected with both the H3 and H6 subtypes. This is the first investigation to find antibodies to the H6 subtype in seals. Although the H6 subtype had been isolated only from avians, genetic analysis had suggested that the H6 subtype could become a novel mammalian pathogen. For definitive diagnosis, detection of the virus from the tissue or mucus of seals is required.

      A herpesvirus was isolated from Thomson's gazelle (Gazella thomsoni) kept at a zoological garden in Japan during an outbreak of epizootic acute encephalitis. The virus, gazelle herpesvirus 1 (GHV-1), was serologically related to equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1). However, DNA fingerprints of GHV-1 were different from those of EHV-1 and other equine herpesviruses. Southern hybridization with probes of cloned BamHI fragments derived from UL and US segments of EHV-1 revealed differences in the DNA restriction profiles throughout the entire genome. Nucleotide sequences were determined for a conserved region of an essential envelope glycoprotein B (gB) gene and a type-specific glycoprotein G (gG) homologue gene. The predicted amino acid sequence of GHV-1 gB showed 97, 92, 61, and 57% identity to EHV-1, EHV-4, feline herpesvirus, and pseudorabies virus, respectively, indicating that GHV-1 was closer to EHV-1 than any other herpesvirus. The GHV-1 gG gene showed 93.2, 92.3, and 53% identity to EHV-1, EHV-8, and EHV-4 gGs, respectively. GHV-1 was virulent to suckling mice of the ICR strain by intracerebral inoculation and was virulent to 4-week-old BALB/c mice by intranasal inoculation, causing neurological symptoms and death. We conclude that GHV-1 is a new type of equine herpesvirus with strong neurotropism.

      The Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWA) is a newly described North American arenavirus. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the biology of this virus in its natural rodent host, Neotoma albigula (white-throated woodrat). Thirteen adult, 7 juvenile, and 8 newborn woodrats each were inoculated subcutaneously with 1,000 cell culture infectious dose50 of the WWA virus prototype strain AV 9310135. All 28 animals became infected (as measured by the recovery of infectious virus and/or seroconversion) and no overt illness was associated with infection. Infection and virus shedding in the adult animals were transient (less than 59 days) whereas virus shedding in animals inoculated at birth persisted through 164 days of age. These results indicate that the duration of WWA virus infection in N. albigula is dependent upon the animal's age at the onset of infection and that neonatal infection can result in chronic (perhaps lifelong) virus shedding.

      Rodents are principal hosts for each of the well-characterized arenaviruses. Prior to the present study, Tamiami (TAM) virus was the sole arenavirus known to be indigenous to North America; it has been isolated only from southern Florida where its primary host is the cotton rat Sigmodon hispidus. Recently, arenavirus antibody was found in Neotoma albigula woodrats collected from the southwestern United States. The purpose of the present study was to isolate and characterize the arenavirus associated with N. albigula. Three isolates of a novel arenavirus (proposed name ""Whitewater Arroyo,"" WWA) were recovered from two arenavirus antibody-positive N. albigula collected from Whitewater Arroyo in McKinley County, New Mexico. Two-way serologic tests indicated that WWA virus is antigenically distinct from other arenaviruses but most closely related to TAM virus. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleocapsid protein gene sequence data showed that WWA virus is a novel arenavirus that is genetically most closely related to TAM virus. The recovery of WWA virus from antibody-positive N. albigula suggests that WWA virus infection in this species can be chronic and thus that N. albigula is a reservoir host of the virus.

      The objective of this study was to elucidate the natural rodent host relationships of Guanarito and Pirital viruses (family Arenaviridae) in the plains of central Venezuela. Ninety-two arenavirus isolates from 607 animals, representing 10 different rodent species, were characterized to the level of serotype. The 92 isolates comprised 19 Guanarito virus strains and 73 Pirital virus strains. The 19 Guanarito virus isolates were from Zygodontomys brevicauda; 72 (98.6%) of the 73 Pirital virus isolates were from Sigmodon alstoni. These results indicate that the natural rodent associations of these 2 sympatric arenaviruses are highly specific and that Z brevicauda and S. alstoni are the principal rodent hosts of Guanarito and Pirital viruses, respectively.

      The purpose of this study was to extend our knowledge of the geographic distribution and genetic diversity of the arenavirus(es) associated with Neotoma species (woodrats) in the southwestern United States. Infectious arenavirus was recovered from 14 (3.3%) of 425 woodrats. The virus-positive species included N. albigula in New Mexico and Oklahoma, N. cinerea in Utah, N. mexicana in New Mexico and Utah, and N. micropus in Texas. Analyses of viral nucleocapsid protein gene sequence data indicated that all the isolates were strains of the Whitewater Arroyo virus, an arenavirus previously known only from northwestern New Mexico. Analyses of the sequence data also indicated that there can be substantial genetic diversity among strains of Whitewater Arroyo virus from conspecific woodrats collected from different localities and substantial genetic diversity among strains from different woodrat species collected from the same locality.

      Rodents collected from the Venezuelan llanos (plains) during field studies of viral hemorrhagic fever were tested for evidence of hantavirus infection. Hantavirus antibody was found in one (7.7%) of 13 Oryzomys bicolor, one (3.4%) of 29 Rattus rattus, 10 (6.0%) of 166 Sigmodon alstoni and one (2.2%) of 45 Zygodontomys brevicauda. Hantavirus-specific RNA was detected in lung tissues from four antibody-positive rodents: two S. alstoni from Portuguesa State and one S. alstoni each from Cojedes and Barinas States. A hantavirus isolate (herein identified as VHV-574) was recovered from lung tissue from a hantavirus RNA-positive S. alstoni collected from Portuguesa State. The results of serological tests and analyses of small and medium RNA segment nucleotide sequence data indicated that VHV-574 represents a novel hantavirus (proposed name 'Caño Delgadito') that is distinct from all previously characterized hantaviruses. The results of analyses of nucleotide sequence data from the four hantavirus RNA-positive S. alstoni suggested that Caño Delgadito virus is widely distributed in the Venezuelan llanos.

      A virus pool isolated from lymphoid tissue of a macaque (PBj) infected for 14 months with SIV/SMM was found to be associated with acute disease and death. Six of six pig-tailed macaques, one of three rhesus macaques, and three of four SIV/SMM-seronegative mangabeys developed acute disease within 5 days and died from 7 to 13 days postinoculation; however, neither of two SIV/SMM-infected mangabeys died or developed disease. The virus associated with acute disease and death was shown by electron microscopy to be a lentivirus and was serologically indistinguishable from SIV/SMM by immunofluorescence and radioimmunoprecipitation assays. A biologic clone generated from lymphoid tissue of an animal that died 7 days after inoculation of the lethal pool resulted in death within 8 days of three of three pig-tailed macaques. Comparison of the lethal virus, designated SIV/SMM(PBj14), with the parent virus, SIV/SMM-9 (the isolate with which macaque PBj was originally inoculated), showed that although the kinetics of replication in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from pig-tailed macaques and mangabey monkeys were similar, SIV/SMM(PBj14) replicated more efficiently than SIV/SMM-9 in human PBMC and also replicated in chimpanzee PBMC whereas SIV/SMM and other SIV isolates did not. In addition, the variant was shown to replicate efficiently in some established cell lines whereas replication of SIV/SMM-9 in cell lines could be demonstrated only occasionally. That parental SIV/SMM-9, but not SIV/SMM(PBj14), was neutralized by serum from macaque PBj suggests that the variant may have been generated by immune selection. Comparison of sequential virus isolates from macaque PBj for host range and the ability to be neutralized and of sequential serum samples for neutralization activity indicated that changes in biologic properties were detected in virus isolates and serum obtained at 6 months after infection and later. Normal macaque PBMC infected in vitro with SIV/SMM(PBj14), but not with SIV/SMM-9 or other virus pools from PBj, formed syncytia with Sup-T1 cells, whereas all isolates formed syncytia with MOLT-4 clone 8 cells. These data suggest that, relative to SIV/SMM-9, SIV/SMM(PBj14) acquired multiple mutations, at least one (or more) of which is in the gene coding for the envelope glycoprotein. Continued analysis of this series of SIV/SMM isolates with diverse properties may lead to the identification of specific regions of the viral genome that influence defined biologic properties. Furthermore, the availability of a strain of SIV that induces rapid onset of disease and death may facilitate screening of drugs for antiviral activity against lentiviruses.

      Canid herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1) is a well-known cause of fatal hepatic and renal necrosis in neonatal puppies. In adult dogs infected with CaHV-1, papulovesicular genital lesions may be observed. CaHV-1 infection during pregnancy can lead to embryonic resorption, abortion, and stillbirth. In high-density dog populations, CaHV-1 can also contribute to kennel cough. Furthermore, recent literature has clearly documented that CaHV-1 can induce ocular disease in immature and adult dogs. The current study describes a case of fatal CaHV-1 infection in a 9-year-old spayed female Bichon Frise dog. Following a history of vomiting and diarrhea, the dog deteriorated and subsequently died. The main lesions were multifocal areas of necrosis with intranuclear inclusion bodies in the liver, adrenal gland, and small intestine, similar to the lesions observed in CaHV-1-infected puppies. Infection with CaHV-1 was confirmed on samples of liver by polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. There was no indication of immunosuppression in this dog. Based on the results presented herein, CaHV-1 should be included in the list of differential diagnoses of hepatic necrosis in adult dogs.

      In 2007, an H3N2 influenza A virus was isolated from Canadian mink. This virus was found to be phylogenetically related to a triple reassortant influenza virus which emerged in Canadian swine in 2005, but it is antigenically distinct. The transmission of the virus from swine to mink seems to have occurred following the feeding of animals with a ration composed of uncooked meat by-products of swine obtained from slaughterhouse facilities. Serological analyses suggest that the mink influenza virus does not circulate in the swine population. Presently, the prevalence of influenza virus in Canadian farmed and wild mink populations is unknown. The natural occurrence of influenza virus infection in mink with the presence of clinical signs is a rare event that deserves to be reported.

      Outbreaks of jungle yellow fever in man have been recorded twice from eastern Panama of recent years, first in 1948 and again in 1956. Since then, a close surveillance has been maintained on virus activity in eastern Panama. Recent field observations and serological tests on 402 monkey sera indicate that there was an outbreak of yellow fever among monkeys of southern Darién Province some time between 1963 and 1965. It does not appear that the outbreak has spread as yet to other areas. Virus transmission may have been permanently disrupted during the drought which affected the region in 1965. However, if the virus had managed to survive this unfavourable period, an epizootic wave might have evolved, invading forested areas immediately east of the Panama Canal, now inhabited by a dense non-immune human population.

      The role of the ancestral sylvatic cycle of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) is not well understood in the endemic areas of eastern Africa. We therefore analysed the ASF infection status on samples collected from 51 free-ranging warthogs (Phacocherus africanus) and 1576 Ornithodorus porcinus ticks from 26 independent warthog burrows at a single ranch in Kenya. Abattoir samples from 83 domestic pigs without clinical symptoms, originating from specific locations with no recent reported ASF outbreaks were included in this study. All samples were derived from areas of central Kenya, where ASF outbreaks have been reported in the past. Infection with ASFV was confirmed in 22 % of O. porcinus pools, 3.22 % of adult warthog serum samples and 49 % of domestic pig serum samples by using p72-based PCR. All of the warthog sera were positive for anti-ASFV antibodies, investigated by using ELISA, but none of the domestic pig sera were positive. Twenty O. porcinus-, 12 domestic pig- and three warthog-derived viruses were genotyped at four polymorphic loci. The ASFV isolates from ticks and domestic pigs clustered within p72 genotype X. By contrast, ASF viruses genotyped directly from warthog sera, at same locality as the tick isolates, were within p72 genotype IX and genetically similar to viruses causing recent ASF outbreaks in Kenya and Uganda. This represents the first report of the co-existence of different ASFV genotypes in warthog burrow-associated ticks and adult wild warthogs. The data from this and earlier studies suggest transfer of viruses of at least two different p72 genotypes, from wild to domestic pigs in East Africa.

      A cross-sectional study was undertaken to determine the current prevalence of leptospirosis and hantaviral infections, and the socio-demographic characteristics and risk factors of infected patients, in Kandy, Sri Lanka. This report discusses the serological evidence of hantavirus infections among 105 suspected leptospirosis patients, 8 of whom had hantavirus antibodies. Serotyping ELISA showed that these 8 patients had high optical density values for Thailand virus. Most of the sera showed that the focus reduction neutralization test titer against Thailand virus was higher than that against Seoul virus, thereby suggesting that the hantaviral antibodies found in Sri Lanka are different from Seoul virus but closely related to Thailand virus. These findings imply that the hantaviral infection found in Kandy, Sri Lanka appears to be due to a virus similar to Thailand virus. Epidemiological analysis revealed that the association between hantavirus infection and socio-demographic characteristics was not statistically significant.

      Picobirnaviruses (PBV) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome. In this study a PBV strain, PBV/Horse/India/BG-Eq-3/2010, was identified in the faeces of a 10 month old weaned female foal with diarrhoea in January 2010 from Kolkata, India. Surprisingly, sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of a short stretch of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene revealed close genetic relatedness (> 98% nucleotide identity) to a human genogroup I PBV strain (Hu/GPBV1) detected earlier from the same part of India. Our observations together with earlier findings on genetic relatedness between human and animal PBV warrant further studies on zoonotic potential.

      The nucleotide sequence and genome organization of a new member of Caliciviridae was determined. Cell culture inoculated with fecal matter from walrus was used to recover fragments of a new virus by Suppression Subtractive Hybridization (SSH). The isolate was identified as a member of the Vesivirus genus of Caliciviridae and designated the name Walrus Calicivirus (WCV). Sets of PCR primers spanning the entire putative genome were designed using known sequences of other vesiviruses. The assembled genome was 8289 nucleotides (nt) long and shared no more than 87% identity with sequences of the other members of the genus Vesivirus. The largest open reading frame (ORF1) between positions 4-5646 encoded a polyprotein. ORF2, found at position 5652-7778, encoded a putative capsid protein. ORF3 overlapped ORF2 and encoded a small basic protein. Comparative analysis of multiple caliciviral capsid proteins was performed to propose a uniform capsid structural organization for this viral family.

      We have carried out an antigenic analysis and nucleotide sequence comparison of the envelope glycoprotein of recognized louping ill virus strains isolated from Scotland with that of a Norwegian virus known to cause encephalomyelitis in sheep. Monoclonal antibodies with defined specificity for the louping ill virus envelope glycoprotein failed to distinguish between the Norwegian virus and prototype louping ill virus in indirect immunofluorescence, haemagglutination inhibition and neutralization tests. Nucleotide sequencing of the envelope glycoprotein and alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence with other known sequences revealed that the Norwegian virus closely resembles (> 95% identity for nucleotide and > 98% identity for amino acid sequences) louping ill virus. Maximum variation in identities among four strains of louping ill virus were 4.4% and 1.8% respectively for nucleotide and amino acid alignments. We conclude that sheep encephalomyelitis in Norway is caused by louping ill virus. These results imply that other viruses present in Europe and known to cause encephalitis/encephalomyelitis of sheep could be caused by louping ill virus.

      Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are single-stranded DNA viruses that are endemic in human populations without known clinical sequelae and are being evaluated as vectors for human gene therapy. To better understand the biology of this virus, we examined a number of nonhuman primate species for the presence of previously uncharacterized AAVs and characterized their structure and distribution. AAV genomes were widely disseminated throughout multiple tissues of a variety of nonhuman primate species. Surprising diversity of sequence, primarily localized to hypervariable regions of the capsid protein, was detected. This diversity of sequence is caused, in part, by homologous recombination of co-infecting parental viruses that modify the serologic reactivity and tropism of the virus. This is an example of rapid molecular evolution of a DNA virus in a way that was formerly thought to be restricted to RNA viruses.

      The island fox is listed as a threatened species in California. A serologic survey of 194 island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) was conducted over the entire range of the species on the Channel Islands (California, USA). Antibody prevalence against canine adenovirus and canine parvovirus reached 97% and 59%, respectively, in some populations sampled. Antibody prevalence of canine herpesvirus, canine coronavirus, leptospirosis and toxoplasmosis were low. Antibodies against canine distemper virus were not detected.

      From the end of 1994 to the beginning of 1995, 49 patients with hemorrhagic symptoms were hospitalized in the Makokou General Hospital in northeastern Gabon. Yellow fever (YF) virus was first diagnosed in serum by use of polymerase chain reaction followed by blotting, and a vaccination campaign was immediately instituted. The epidemic, known as the fall 1994 epidemic, ended 6 weeks later. However, some aspects of this epidemic were atypical of YF infection, so a retrospective check for other etiologic agents was undertaken. Ebola (EBO) virus was found to be present concomitantly with YF virus in the epidemic. Two other epidemics (spring and fall 1996) occurred in the same province. GP and L genes of EBO virus isolates from all three epidemics were partially sequenced, which showed a difference of <0.1% in the base pairs. Sequencing also showed that all isolates were very similar to subtype Zaire EBO virus isolates from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

      The Iberian lynx is the most endangered felid species. During winter/spring 2006/7, a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) outbreak of unexpected virulence killed about 2/3 of the infected Iberian lynxes. All FeLV-positive animals were co-infected with feline hemoplasmas. To further characterize the Iberian lynx FeLV strain and evaluate its potential virulence, the FeLV envelope gene variable region A (VRA) mutant spectrum was analyzed using the Roche 454 sequencing technology, and an in vivo transmission study of lynx blood to specified-pathogen-free cats was performed. VRA mutations indicated weak apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme and catalytic polypeptide-like cytidine deaminase (APOBEC) restriction of FeLV replication, and variants characteristic of aggressive FeLV strains, such as FeLV-C or FeLV-A/61C, were not detected. Cats exposed to FeLV/Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum-positive lynx blood did not show a particularly severe outcome of infection. The results underscore the special susceptibility of Iberian lynxes to infectious diseases.

      This study was carried out to determine the current state of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in different animal species in Sharkia governorate in Egypt. In addition, we investigated the spreading of the virus through water and soil in the animal environment as well as by rodents. The isolation rates of FMD virus in tissue culture were 39.6%, 11.4%, 41.2% and 100% for cattle, buffalo, sheep and goat respectively. All animals did not show any clinical signs for FMD. In addition, the virus was isolated from the milk of an animal as well as from a water sample while all soil samples were negative.

      Hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains isolated from members of the primitive Paharia ethnic community of Eastern India were studied to gain insight into the genetic diversity and evolution of the virus. The Paharia tribe has remained quite separate from the rest of the Indians and differs culturally, genetically, and linguistically from the mainstream East Indian population, whose HBV strains were previously characterized. Full-length HBV DNA was PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Phylogenetic relationships between the tribal sequences and reference sequences from the mainstream population were assessed, and divergence times of subgenotypes of HBV genotype D were estimated. HBV was found in 2% of the Paharias participating in the study. A predominance of hepatitis B e antigen-negative infection (73%) was observed among the Paharias, and the genome sequences of the HBV strains exhibited relative homogeneity, with a very low prevalence of mutations. The novel feature of Paharia HBV was the exclusive presence of the D5 subgenotype, which was recently identified in Eastern India. Analysis of the four open reading frames (ORFs) of these tribal HBV D5 sequences and comparison with previously reported D1 to D7 sequences enabled the identification of 27 specific amino acid residues, including 6 unique ones, that could be considered D5 signatures. The estimated divergence times among subgenotypes D1 to D5 suggest that D5 was the first to diverge and hence is the most ancient of the D subgenotypes. The presence of a specific, ancient subgenotype of HBV within an ethnically primitive, endogamous population highlights the importance of studies of HBV genetics in well-separated human populations to understand viral transmission between communities and genome evolution.

      Two biologically and genetically distinct hantaviruses were isolated from blood and urine specimens collected from four Yugoslavian patients with clinically severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Viral isolates from three patients, designated strains Belgrade 1-3, were distinct from Hantaan, Seoul, Puumala, and Prospect Hill viruses as determined by plaque-reduction neutralization tests and restriction analysis of enzymatically amplified M-segment fragments. The fourth isolate, called Kraljevo, was indistinguishable from Hantaan virus. Strains Belgrade 1 and 2, like the Kraljevo strain, caused a fatal meningoencephalitis in newborn mice inoculated with 100 pfu of virus intracerebrally and intraperitoneally. Strain Belgrade 3 was much less neurovirulent, requiring 30,000 pfu of virus to cause fatal disease in mice. These data indicate that two distinct hantaviruses, one of which constitutes a new serotype, cause clinically severe HFRS in Yugoslavia.

      Louping-ill (LI) is a tick-borne viral disease of red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus Lath. (Tetraonidae: Galliformes), and sheep, Ovis aries L. (Bovidae: Artiodactyla), that causes economic loss to upland farms and sporting estates. Unvaccinated sheep, grouse and mountain hares, Lepus timidus L. (Leporidae: Lagomorpha), are known to transmit LI virus, whereas red deer, Cenrus elaphus L. (Cervidae: Artiodactyla), and rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus L. (Leporidae: Lagomorpha), do not. However, the role of small mammals is unknown. Here, we determine the role of small mammals, in particular field voles, Microtus agrestis L. (Muridae: Rodentia), in the persistence of LI virus on upland farms and sporting estates in Scotland, using field sampling and non-viraemic transmission trials. Small mammals were not abundant on the upland sites studied, few ticks were found per animal and none of the caught animals tested seropositive to LI virus. Laboratory trials provided no evidence that small mammals (field voles, bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus L. (Muridae: Rodentia), and wood mice, Apodemus sylvaticus L. (Muridae: Rodentia), can transmit LI virus between cofeeding ticks and, in the field, LI virus was prevalent only in areas with known LI virus competent hosts (grouse, mountain hares or unvaccinated sheep) and absent elsewhere. In contrast to the case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus in Europe, it is concluded that small mammals seem to be relatively unimportant in LI virus persistence.

      There are currently two known serotypes of equine adenovirus (EAdV), equine adenovirus type 1 (EAdV1) and equine adenovirus type 2 (EAdV2); EAdV1 is predominantly associated with upper respiratory tract infections while EAdV2 appears to have a higher association with gastrointestinal infection, however, very little is known about the prevalence of these viruses in horse populations in Australia. In this study we tested 122 serum samples obtained from horses in New South Wales, Australia, using a standard serum neutralization (SN) assay and ELISA. Ninety-seven of the 122 sera displayed had moderate to high titers of antibodies to EAdV1 and/or EAdV2. Eighteen of the 122 sera were positive for both EAdV1 and EAdV2. In contrast, only thirty-seven positive samples were detected using the ELISA. These results suggest that EAdV1 and EAdV2 infections are widely prevalent in the horse population tested and that SN is currently the most suitable assay for the detection of EAdV1 and EAdV2 antibodies in equine serum.

      The Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) have been detected in several species of animals from different countries worldwide, including in South America. The host range of these viruses has increased in recent years; thus, in order to contribute to the knowledge in this topic we analyzed samples from captivity animals from Uruguay. We found the presence of PBVs in four species of animals, Panthera leo, Panthera onca, Puma concolor and Oncifelis geoffroyi, representing new PBV-susceptible hosts. All strains belonged to genogroup I.

      Human genital tumors as well as recurrent laryngeal papillomas were analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) 6 and HPV 11 sequences. HPV 11 DNA was found in 7 of 14 laryngeal papillomas; in the 7 other tumors no HPV DNA was demonstrated. HPV 11 DNA was also found in all five atypical condylomata of the cervix included in this study. Condylomata acuminata mainly contained HPV 6 DNA. From 63 biopsy specimens, 41 clearly harbored HPV 6 DNA and 13 harbored HPV 11 DNA. In three tumors accurate typing was impossible, and in six additional ones neither HPV 6 nor HPV 11 DNA could be demonstrated. The data support a genital origin of laryngeal papillomavirus infections. In 4 of 24 malignant tumors, HPV 11 DNA or related sequences were demonstrated; 2 of the 4 were biopsy specimens from invasive cancer, and the other 2 originated from carcinomata in situ. A possible role of this or related papillomavirus types in the induction of malignant genital tumors remains to be elucidated.

      Pseudorabies virus was isolated in cell culture from the brain tissue of a 3.5-year-old male Florida panther (Felis concolor coryi). The virus was not isolated from other tissues collected at necropsy. Based upon a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the virus was determined to have the classical wild-type virulent genotype, glycoprotein I+ (gI+) and thymidine kinase+ (TK+).

      During 2007-09, ear-notch samples from free-living (n=527) and farmed (n=237) Austrian red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus) were tested for bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1) and type 2 (BVDV-2) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and single-tube real-time reverse transcription PCR. Ear-notch samples were collected by applying modified ear tags from randomly selected hunter-harvested red deer and from individuals originating from deer holdings. All samples tested negative for BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Results of this study show no evidence of persistently infected animals. They indicate further that BVDV is playing a minor role in free-living and farmed red deer in Austria. Ear-notch samples are an effective tool for in vivo and postmortem detection of BVDV in wildlife. This sample collection technique can be easily used in combination with tagging individual wild animals kept in captivity.

      Nonhuman primates host a plethora of potentially zoonotic microbes, with simian retroviruses receiving heightened attention due to their roles in the origins of human immunodeficiency viruses type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2. However, incomplete taxonomic and geographic sampling of potential hosts, especially the African colobines, has left the full range of primate retrovirus diversity unexplored. Blood samples collected from 31 wild-living red colobus monkeys (Procolobus [Piliocolobus] rufomitratus tephrosceles) from Kibale National Park, Uganda, were tested for antibodies to simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-cell lymphotrophic virus (STLV), and simian foamy virus (SFV) and for nucleic acids of these same viruses using genus-specific PCRs. Of 31 red colobus tested, 22.6% were seroreactive to SIV, 6.4% were seroreactive to STLV, and 97% were seroreactive to SFV. Phylogenetic analyses of SIV polymerase (pol), STLV tax and long terminal repeat (LTR), and SFV pol and LTR sequences revealed unique SIV and SFV strains and a novel STLV lineage, each divergent from corresponding retroviral lineages previously described in Western red colobus (Procolobus badius badius) or black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza). Phylogenetic analyses of host mitochondrial DNA sequences revealed that red colobus populations in East and West Africa diverged from one another approximately 4.25 million years ago. These results indicate that geographic subdivisions within the red colobus taxonomic complex exert a strong influence on retroviral phylogeny and that studying retroviral diversity in closely related primate taxa should be particularly informative for understanding host-virus coevolution.

      Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a severe problem in Estonia. In the present article the first genetic analysis of Estonian TBEV strains is described. In total, seven TBEV strains were isolated from ticks (Ixodes ricinus and I. persulcaus), rodents (Apodemus agrarius and Cletrionomys glareolus), and serum from a tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) patient. The nucleic acid sequences of the viral genome encoding almost the complete E protein (nt 41-1250) and the 3'-NCR-termini of the Estonian TBEV strains were determined by direct sequencing of RT-PCR products. The results showed that all three known TBEV subtypes, Western TBEV (W-TBEV), Far-Eastern TBEV (FE-TBEV), and Siberian TBEV (S-TBEV), co-circulate in Estonia. The Estonian TBEV strains of the S-TBEV and W-TBEV subtypes clustered with the previously reported strains from Latvia and Lithuania. Within the FE-TBEV subtype, however, the Estonian strain Est2546 clustered together with the strain Sofjin, originating from the Far-East of Russia, but not with the strain RK1424, isolated in the neighboring Latvia. This suggests a different evolutionary history for the Estonian and the Latvian strains in the FE-TBEV subtype. The Estonian TBEV strain (Est3535), which belonged to the S-TBEV subtype, had an organization of the 3'-NCR similar to that of strains from the Far-East of Russia (Irkutsk). The 3'-NCRs of Estonian strains of the W-TBEV subtype (Est3051, Est3053, Est3476, and Est3509) were very similar to those of the strain Ljubljana I from the Balkans. In the 3'-NCR sequence of the Estonian strain Est2546, which belonged to the FE-TBEV subtype, a deletion from position 10461 to 10810 extending approximately 10 nucleotides into the core element, was detected.

      Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) have shown high West Nile virus (WNV) seroprevalence, and WNV infection has been suggested as a cause of morbidity and mortality in this species. We experimentally infected nine eastern gray squirrels with WNV to determine the clinical effects of infection and to assess their potential role as amplifying hosts. We observed no morbidity or mortality attributable to WNV infection, but lesions were apparent in several organs. We detected mean viremias of 10(5.1) and 10(4.8) plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL on days 3 and 4 post-infection (DPI) and estimated that approximately 2.1% of Culex pipiens feeding on squirrels during 1-5 DPI would become infectious. Thus, S. carolinensis are unlikely to be important amplifying hosts and may instead dampen the intensity of transmission in most host communities. The low viremias and lack of mortality observed in S. carolinensis suggest that they may be useful as sentinels of spillover from the enzootic amplification cycle.

      Several of the human-pathogenic arenaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever and have to be handled under biosafety level 4 conditions, including Lassa virus. Rapid and safe inactivation of specimens containing these viruses is fundamental to enable downstream processing for diagnostics or research under lower biosafety conditions. We established a protocol to test the efficacy of inactivation methods using the low-pathogenic Morogoro arenavirus as surrogate for the related highly pathogenic viruses. As the validation of chemical inactivation methods in cell culture systems is difficult due to cell toxicity of commonly used chemicals, we employed filter devices to remove the chemical and concentrate the virus after inactivation and before inoculation into cell culture. Viral replication in the cells was monitored over 4 weeks by using indirect immunofluorescence and immunofocus assay. The performance of the protocol was verified using published inactivation methods including chemicals and heat. Ten additional methods to inactivate virus in infected cells or cell culture supernatant were validated and shown to reduce virus titers to undetectable levels. In summary, we provide a robust protocol for the validation of chemical and physical inactivation of arenaviruses in cell culture, which can be readily adapted to different inactivation methods and specimen matrices.

      We vaccinated six captive badgers housed with five controls, and monitored blood antibody titers and white cell counts of both groups for 63 days postvaccination between 29 August and 3 December 1992. Five vaccinated badgers responded with antibody titers ranging from 1:64 to 1:1024 by 63 days postvaccination, whereas the sixth badger did not respond. Treatment badgers also had significant (P < 0.05) decreases in lymphocytes on days 16, 29, and 63. No badgers developed clinical signs of distemper. Control badgers did not produce antibodies against CD virus; thus, the vaccine virus probably was not transmitted between treatment and control animals. The vaccine appears safe for use in healthy badgers, but additional safety and efficacy study is needed.

      Wild rodents (214) of fourteen species were trapped at seven sites in Senegal. Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys erythroleucus were among the most frequently collected species (77.2% of total capture). All rodents were examined for the presence of anti-Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibody; the prevalence over all sampled species was 3.8%, varying widely with respect to species and location. Four of 14 species of rodents were found to have anti-RVFV antibodies: Rattus rattus (one positive of two tested) Mastomys huberti (13.5%), A. niloticus (4.3%), and M. erthroleucus (2.4%). The highest prevalence of anti-RVFV antibody was recorded within the enzootic area of the Senegal River delta, at Richard Toll (9.6%). A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus and a strain of laboratory-bred mice were experimentally inoculated with two strains of RVFV and examined for viremia, illness, seroconversion and mortality. A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus demonstrated a limited resistance to infection, thus potentially allowing for the replication of virus in these animals and making these species possible candidates as hosts in the maintenance cycle of RVFV in nature.

      From November 2004 to April 2007, specimens were obtained from 2,281 patients with acute respiratory tract illness in Normandy, France. Eighteen strains of influenza C virus were detected in these samples using a combined tissue culture/RT-PCR diagnostic method. Most patients with influenza C virus infection (13/18) were infants or young children (<2 years of age). The most frequent symptoms were fever and cough, and the clinical presentation of influenza C virus infection was similar to that of other respiratory viruses. Thirteen of the 18 infected patients were hospitalized; 3 presented with a severe lower respiratory infection. The hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of 10 isolates was sequenced to determine the lineages of the circulating influenza C viruses. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the isolated strains had an HE gene belonging to the C/Yamagata/26/81-related lineage. These results show that influenza C virus regularly circulates in Normandy and generally causes a mild upper respiratory infection. Because the differential clinical diagnosis of influenza C virus infection is not always easy, it is important to identify viral strains for both patient management and epidemiological purposes.

      In 1996 a variant lyssavirus was isolated from an insectivorous bat (yellow bellied, sheath tail bat-Saccolaimus flaviventris) in Australia. The nucleocapsid protein (N), matrix protein (M), phosphoprotein (P), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L) genes of the Australian bat lyssavirus (ABL) insectivorous isolate were compared with that previously described from a frugivorous bat (Pteropus sp.), and showed sequence divergence at both the nucleotide and amino acid sequence level of 20% and 4-12%, respectively. Comparison of deduced protein sequences of ABL isolates from Pteropus and insectivorous bats, showed that viral isolates were homologous and varied by only a few percent. However, these viruses separated into two distinct clades; those isolated from Pteropus or those from Saccolaimus flaviventris bats, when comparisons were made at the nucleotide level. Nucleoprotein sequence comparisons also showed insectivorous isolates to be of the same putative genotype (genotype 7) as that isolated from frugivorous bats. Immediately after the isolation of ABL from an insectivorous bat, the first human case of ABL infection was identified. PCR and sequence analysis done on cerebrospinal fluid, brain and virus isolated from fresh brain tissue of this human case, was consistent with this infection originating from an insectivorous bat. Monoclonal antibody profiling studies of the virus isolated from the human brain tissues supported this conclusion. Sequence comparisons done on the nucleocapsid (N) gene of insectivorous or frugivorous bats showed no geographic associations between isolates but did delineate between the variants of ABL in Australia.

      Two viruses, designated 99-8130(C) and 99-8130(I), were isolated in calf testis cells from the colon and ileum, respectively, of a suckled beef calf which had developed dysentery and died. Electron microscopy indicated that the mean (sd) size of the viral particles, 83 (2.5) nm, and their morphology were consistent with their being members of the family Adenoviridae. They were confirmed as adenoviruses by PCR when products of the expected size (608 bp) were amplified from both isolates by using a primer pair specific for members of the genus Atadenovirus. A comparison of the sequence of a 567 bp segment of the 99-8130(C) amplicon with that of other prototype bovine adenovirus (BAdV) strains of atadenoviruses identified the isolate as BAdV serotype 6 (BAdV-6), which had 99.3 per cent and 100 per cent identities at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively, with the prototype BAdV-6 strain 671130. A virus neutralisation test was developed and indicated a high prevalence of antibody to BAdV-6 in Northern Irish cattle. There was no evidence of adenoviral inclusions in tissues from the affected calf and no antigen was detected when the tissues were stained by an immunoperoxidase technique, using a homologous antiserum raised in rabbits. The two viruses were the third reported isolation of BAdV-6, and the first from a clinically ill bovine animal.

      We analysed the complete coding sequences of all recognized species of Aedes-borne flavivirus, including previously uncharacterized viruses within the yellow fever virus (YFV), Spondweni virus (SPOV) and dengue virus (DENV) groups. Two major phylogenetic lineages were revealed: one included the YFV and Entebbe bat virus groups, and the other included the DENV, SPOV and Culex-borne flavivirus groups. This analysis supported previous evidence that Culex-borne flaviviruses have evolved from ancestral Aedes-borne viruses. However, the topology at the junction between these lineages remains complex and may be refined by the discovery of viruses related to the Kedougou virus. Additionally, viral evolution was found to be associated with the appearance of new biological characteristics; mutations that may modify the envelope protein structure were identified for seven viruses within the YFV group, and an expansion of host-vector range was identified in the two major evolutionary lineages, which in turn may facilitate the emergence of mosquito-borne flaviviruses.

      Simian hemorrhagic fever (SHF) virus is a member of the Togaviridae family which currently is unclassified to genus. We have studied the relatedness of four different SHF virus isolates obtained from infected macaque or patas monkeys. Differences were found among isolates in type and severity of disease produced in patas monkeys, cell sensitivity to infection, viral antigens, and levels of specific antibody induced in patas monkeys. Based on these criteria, the four isolates have been grouped in two categories: those producing acute infections in patas monkeys (LVR, P-180) and those producing persistent infections (P-248, P-741). The P-180 isolate induced the most severe disease in experimentally infected patas monkeys, but only occasionally were their infections fatal. Persistently infected patas monkeys were viremic over a period of years, but showed no signs or symptoms of infection. All four isolates were found to be antigenically related by use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); the P-248 isolate showing the weakest antigenic relationship. However, none of the four isolates induced cross-neutralizing antibodies in infected patas monkeys. High titers of specific IgG antibody (up to 31,250 as determined by ELISA) were induced in acutely infected patas monkeys (LVR, P-180), but antibody was barely detectable (less than or equal to 50) in persistently infected patas monkeys (P-248, P-741). LVR lytically infected USU-104 cells, patas monkey peritoneal macrophages (PMAC), and rhesus monkey PMAC. The P-180 isolate lytically infected both patas monkey PMAC and rhesus monkey PMAC, but not USU-104 cells. The isolates producing persistent infections (P-248, P-741) lytically infected only rhesus monkey PMAC. These results show that marked differences exist among isolates of SHF virus from naturally infected animals. These differences should be useful in categorizing new isolates.

      We have previously reported the identification of a novel simian parvovirus in cynomolgus monkeys, which causes severe anemia in immunosuppressed cynomolgus monkeys and is currently being studied as an animal model for human B19 infection. We now report two similar outbreaks of anemia in rhesus and pig-tailed macaques associated with two distinct but similar simian parvoviruses (pig-tailed macaque and rhesus parvovirus). Both viruses have been cloned and over 5000 nucleotides sequenced from each virus. The viruses show marked similarities to other members of the Erythrovirus genus in the Parvoviridae family.

      Wild grey squirrels in North Wales were examined for their serological response to a range of laboratory mouse pathogens. Nineteen squirrels were tested against 14 organisms and a high seroprevalence was found to several, including murine cytomegalovirus, mouse adenovirus, reovirus 3, rotavirus and Sendai virus. Four of the squirrels were seropositive for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, a zoonotic pathogen. None of the infections has previously been reported in squirrels.

      A new human papillomavirus type (HPV 41), distantly related to known HPV prototypes, was isolated from a patient with disseminated facial, peri-anal and foot warts (epidermodysplasia verruciformis was not diagnosed). The viral DNA was molecularly cloned in 2 BamH1 restriction fragments with sizes of 6.5 kb and 0.98 kb, respectively. The classification of this cloned DNA as a new type is based on the degree of cross-hybridization with 40 HPV types under conditions of varying stringency. A total of 106 benign and malignant skin lesions, as well as 71 malignant tumours of different origins, were screened for the presence of HPV-related sequences. In 2 out of 10 squamous-cell carcinomas and in 1 of 3 arsenic keratoses HPV 41 DNA sequences could be detected.

      Serum samples from the male Mousedeer A and the mother, father and sister of A were tested for bovine virus diarrhoea viruses (BVDV) by isolation, and for BVDV antibodies by blocking ELISA and homologous neutralisation test. Further, RNA was extracted and tested by RT-PCR protocol analysing the 5'-untranslated region and the E2 gene of pestivirus. The RT-PCR products were subsequently sequenced. Mousedeer A was positive in virus isolation on three occasions (days 1, 19 and 40) and by RT-PCR. The sister and mother of Mousedeer A were also found virus positive by isolation and RT-PCR. Mousedeer A, its sister and its mother, all had an antibody neutralisation titer below 10. The father of A was virus negative but was positive in the blocking antibody ELISA and had a high neutralisation antibody titer. The repeated detection of BVDV in Mousedeer A, the high amount of virus in serum, the lack of antibodies and the virus positive family members documented that the mousedeer were persistently infected with a pestivirus. The father of A probably had an acute infection resulting in antibodies to pestivirus and viral clearance. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the mousedeer pestivirus was closely related to BVDV Type 1f. The existences of persistently infected animals in non-domestic species have great implications for BVDV eradication campaigns in cattle.

      Febrile tick-borne diseases can be caused by different pathogens. The study objective was to prospectively determine the etiology of infection among adults exposed to tick bite and to detect acute human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), a recently emerging infection, in north-eastern Poland. We evaluated 68 patients (34 males and 34 females, mean age 44.2+/-15 years) who had fever within 4 weeks after a tick bite. Paired sera were tested for antibodies against tick-borne encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Microscopic examination of EDTA whole blood and nested PCR targeting A. phagocytophilum 16S rDNA gene fragment were carried out at enrolment. Tick-borne infections were diagnosed in 57 individuals (84%). Sixty-four patients were hospitalised. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) was revealed in 49 cases; in 39 patients as a single infection, in three patients concurrent with erythema migrans or other Lyme borreliosis symptoms, in five patients concurrent with probable or possible Lyme borreliosis, and in two patients concurrent with A. phagocytophilum infection. Diagnosis of HGA was confirmed in one patient by PCR and in another one by seroconversion. In two further individuals, A. phagocytophilum infection was confirmed by immunofluorescence (antibody titers > or = 1:128), which, however, does not fulfil the ESCAR (European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Study Group on Coxiella, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, and Bartonella) criteria for HGA case definition. Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed in 16 patients; in six of them as a single infection. Both confirmed HGA cases and seropositive individuals had A. phagocytophilum infection concurrent either with Lyme borreliosis (two cases) or with TBE (two cases). The clinical course was severe in three and moderate to mild in the remaining TBE cases, as well as in all Lyme borreliosis and HGA cases. TBE was found the most prevalent disease among adults with febrile illnesses occurring after a tick bite in north-eastern Poland. Concurrent tick-borne infections were frequent with multiple pathogens involved. Two confirmed acute HGA cases (fulfilling the European case definition criteria defined by ESCAR) were detected for the first time in a prospective manner in Poland.

      The family Herpesviridae is a large group of viruses which contain double stranded DNA genomes. Biological characteristics, such as host signs, site of replication and site of latency have been used to describe three major subfamilies, Alphaherpesvirinae, Betaherpesvirinae and Gammaherpesvirinae within the family Herpesviridae. Macropodid herpesviruses (MaHV) have been implicated in fatal outbreaks amongst the captive marsupial populations of Australia. These outbreaks have resulted in the isolation of nine MaHV strains which have been classified into two species called macropodid herpesvirus 1 and 2 (MaHV-1 and MaHV-2). Biological characteristics have been used to place MaHV-1 and -2 within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. Molecular phylogenetic reconstructions indicate an unusual position for MaHV-1 and -2 within the alphaherpesviruses. Current isolates of MaHVs have all been obtained from marsupials exhibiting clinical disease. A common biological characteristic of herpesviruses is the establishment of latent infections in nervous tissue. We have determined that MaHV are able to latently infect eastern grey kangaroos through reactivating and isolating a herpesvirus by inducing immunosuppression. We have investigated the possible sites of latency for MaHV-1 using molecular techniques. Detection of herpesvirus DNA in the trigeminal ganglia taken from two naturally infected eastern grey kangaroos indicates dissemination via a respiratory route.

      Enteric caliciviruses are emerging pathogens responsible for diarrhea or gastroenteritis in their respective hosts. In this report, mink enteric caliciviruses (MEC) were detected in feces from diarrheic mink by both immune electron microscopy (IEM) and RT-PCR using a broadly reactive primer pair (p289/290) targeting the highly conserved RNA polymerase regions of the enteric caliciviruses, Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) and Sapporo-like viruses (SLVs). The MEC possess classical caliciviral morphology with typical cup-shaped depressions on the viral surface. Sequence analyses based on nucleotide and predicted amino acid (aa) sequences of the RT-PCR products indicated that MEC is most closely related genetically to SLVs of humans and animals. The MEC shared the highest aa identities (64-71%) in the RNA polymerase region with both human SLVs and the porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC) Cowden strain SLV, indicating that MEC may belong to an individual genogroup or subgroup in the SLV genus. The MEC shared only limited aa identities in the RNA polymerase region with vesiviruses (40-51%) and NLVs (29-33%). The RNA polymerase regions of the cultivable, non-enteric mink caliciviruses (MCV) were also amplified by RT-PCR using the primer pair Pol1/Pol3 based on sequences of vesiviruses, and the primer pair p289/290. Sequence analysis indicated that these MCV shared higher aa identities in the RNA polymerase region with vesiviruses (58-81%) than with SLVs (43-51%) including the MEC, lagoviruses (35-37%) and NLVs (27-35%), suggesting that they are most closely related genetically to vesiviruses. The MEC associated with diarrhea in mink are morphologically similar to but are genetically distinct from the cultivable MCV and likely represent a new member of the SLV genus.

      Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a vector-borne disease of ruminants disseminated in the tropic and sub-tropic zone of the world. It is also an important problem in the Middle East. Three serotypes (4-9-16) of the virus have been isolated so far in Turkey. Gazella subgutturosa subgutturosa (Goitred Gazella) is native species of Anatolia. Due to risk of extinction, captured Gazelles have been taken under protection in a restricted area at Ceylanpinar state farm. In this study, the presence of Bluetongue virus (BTV) was investigated serologically in 82 Goitred Gazella, 684 sheep and 100 cattle. Seropositivity rates in Gazella, sheep and cattle were detected as 40.2%, 295% and 88%, respectively.

      We have examined the seroprevalence of BDV in wild Raccoons (Procyon lotor) in Hokkaido, Japan. Serum samples from raccoons were examined using ELISA and Western blot assays to detect the presence of serum antibodies that react specifically to BDV antigens. Among 549 investigated individuals, eleven (2.0%) showed a positive reaction to BDV antigens. Brain tissue samples from five individuals were subjected to RT-PCR, which detected BDV sequences in three of them. Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of genetic conservation between BDV sequences derived from raccoons and previously published sequences derived from other animal species.

      We have examined the seroprevalence of BDV in wild Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) in the peninsula (Chiba prefecture), Japan. Serum samples from macaques were examined by the ELISA, Western blot and immunofluorescence assays to detect the presence of serum antibodies that react specifically to BDV antigens. Among 49 investigated individuals, 6 (12.2%) showed positive reaction to BDV antigens. RT-PCR studies detected BDV sequences in brain tissue of one case among four seropositive cases examined. Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of genetic conservation between BDV sequences derived from Japanese macaques and those documented for other animal species. Nevertheless, phylogenetic analysis revealed unique differences between macaque and other species derived BDV sequences.

      In the United States of America, Aujeszky's disease (pseudorabies) has been eradicated from all domestic swine. Some re-emergence of infection occurred as vaccine use diminished. Sporadic outbreaks have also occurred because of the reservoir of infection in feral swine that have spread across the southern two-thirds of the country and Hawaii. In order to be able to understand the origins of re-emerging virus, sequence analysis of variable genes in pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been used to differentiate strains. Most PRV from feral swine can be distinguished from virus circulating in domestic pigs during the national epizootic. However, several feral swine isolates of PRV from south central states are closely related or identical in sequence to strains from domestic pigs. Extensive study by PCR for the presence of virus in the oral cavity of feral pigs disclosed that the viral DNA is distributed widely in tonsils salivary glands, taste buds and even mucosa in the vicinity of tusks. Clearly the virus in feral swine has multiple mechanisms of transmission to insure persistent infection and the threat of re-emergence in domestic swine continues.

      The histopathological development of equine cutaneous papillomas was studied in 78 warts naturally occurring in 50 one to 3-year-old Thoroughbred or Arab horses and in 54 warts experimentally induced in three 2-year-old Thoroughbreds. Lesions in the natural cases were categorized into three phases, growth, development and regression. Main lesions of the growing phase were marked hyperplasia of the basal cells and mild to moderate acanthosis, hyper- and parakeratosis with a few intranuclear inclusion bodies (IIB) which were positive with anti-bovine papillomavirus serum. In the developing phase, there was prominent acanthosis with cellular swelling and fusion, and marked hyper- and parakeratosis. Many IIB were also present in swollen or degenerative prickle cells and granular cells, with a high degree of parakeratosis in keratinocytes. In the regressing phase, epidermal layers were almost normal with only slight hyperplastic change. However, there was rete peg proliferation downward into the dermis with moderate proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen fibres. In addition, in 10 spontaneous and one experimental wart, the lesions were fibropapillomas and this has never been described in horses previously. It was concluded that papillomas were initiated by basal cell hyperplasia without viral antigen production, with formation of acanthosis and hyper- and parakeratosis with IIB production. These findings were confirmed by examination of the experimental cases on the basis of the gross diameter of the warts.

      A total of 535 sera from eight species of wildlife were collected from different game areas in Tanzania between 1987 and 1989. These sera were tested for antibodies against foot-and-mouth disease, bovine herpes virus types 1 and 2, lumpy skin disease, bovine viral diarrhoea, Akabane, bovine ephemeral fever, bluetongue, enzootic bovine leucosis, African horse sickness and African swine fever viruses and Brucella abortus based on the expected species susceptibility. Sera from buffalo Syncerus caffer, wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and topi Damaliscus korrigum contained antibodies against the majority of the pathogens tested. Antibodies to fewer pathogens were detected in sera from the other species. No antibodies to lumpy skin disease virus were detected in any of the sera examined. African horse sickness antibodies were detected in sera from Zebra and African swine fever antibodies were detected in wart hog. The occurrence of antibodies to these agents suggests that wild species act as reservoirs of infection for some of these pathogens. However, until the susceptibility of individual species is proven by isolation of the aetiological agents their role must remain speculative.

      A total of 3,470 sera, collected between 1963 and 1980 from 45 different species of wildlife in nine African countries, was examined for virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies to bovid herpesvirus 2. Antibodies were demonstrated in 20 species including 15 Bovidae, two Suidae, hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) and a green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops); 11 of these species had not been previously recorded as sero-positive. Although the significance of neutralizing antibodies in the absence of virus isolation remains in doubt, results suggest that infection is widespread in wildlife. The highest VN titres were recorded in waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus and K. defassa), reedbuck (Redunca arundinum) and buffalo (Syncerus caffer). Infection appears to be continuous in free-living populations of buffalo and antibodies are present in the majority of animals by the age of 2 yr.

      Sera were collected from 12 Barbary sheet (Ammotragus lervia) and 11 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) occupying sympatric ranges in Palo Duro Canyon, Texas. These were tested for leptospirosis, brucellosis, bovine virus diarrhea, anaplasmosis, vesicular stomatitis, bluetongue (BT), epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), and coccidioidomycosis. Serologic reactors were found to IBR in 3 Barbery sheep, BT in 6 Barbary sheep and 6 mule deer and EHD in 3 Barbary sheep and 4 mule deer. Possible ramifications of evidence for these diseases in wild herbivore populations in this area are discussed.

      Choclo virus (CHOV) and Maporal virus (MAPV) are enzootic in Panama and western Venezuela, respectively. The results of previous studies suggested that the fulvous pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys fulvescens) is the principal host of both viruses. The results of an analysis of nucleotide sequence data in this study indicated that the rodent associated with CHOV is the Costa Rican pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys costaricensis) and that the rodent associated with MAPV is the delicate pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys delicatus). As such, MAPV is ecologically distinct from CHOV and should be considered a species separate from CHOV.

      Sixteen serum samples collected from free-living Japanese serows, Capricornis crispus, between 2001 and 2004 in Morioka and its vicinity were examined for the presence of pestivirus by reverse transcription-nested PCR procedure. Three out of the 16 samples produced a visible band in electrophoresed agarose gels. The nucleotide sequences of the three PCR products were found to be identical. The pestivirus found in the serow was identified as Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) based on nucleotide sequence analyses by phylogeny as well as palindromic nucleotide substitutions at the 5' untranslated regions. Our data first indicated that BVDV-1 infection occurred continuously among the free-living serow populations though the role of BVDV-1 in wild ungulates is currently unknown.

      Reeves' concept of the summer transmission cycle of western equine encephalomyelitis virus in 1945 was that the virus was amplified in a silent transmission cycle involving mosquitoes, domestic chickens, and possibly wild birds, from which it could be transmitted tangentially to and cause disease in human and equine populations. Extensive field and laboratory studies done since 1945 in the Central Valley of California have more clearly defined the specific invertebrate and vertebrate hosts involved in the basic virus transmission cycle, but the overall concept remains unchanged. The basic transmission cycle involves Culex tarsalis as the primary vector mosquito species and house finches and house sparrows as the primary amplifying hosts. Secondary amplifying hosts, upon which Cx. tarsalis frequently feeds, include other passerine species, chickens, and possibly pheasants in areas where they are abundant. Another transmission cycle that most likely is initiated from the Cx. tarsalis-wild bird cycle involves Aedes melanimon and the blacktail jackrabbit. Like humans and horses, California ground squirrels, western tree squirrels, and a few other wild mammal species become infected tangentially with the virus but do not contribute significantly to virus amplification.

      Spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) are abundant predators in the Serengeti ecosystem and interact with other species of wild carnivores and domestic animals in ways that could encourage disease transmission. Hyenas also have a unique hierarchical social system that might affect the flow of pathogens. Antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline panleukopenia virus/canine parvovirus (FPLV/CPV), feline coronavirus/ feline infectious peritonitis virus (FECV/IPV), feline calicivirus (FCV), and feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1) have been detected in other Serengeti predators, indicating that these viruses are present in the ecosystem. The purpose of this study was to determine whether spotted hyenas also had been infected with these viruses and to assess risk factors for infection. Serum samples were collected between 1993 and 2001 from 119 animals in a single clan for which behavioral data on social structure were available and from 121 hyenas ill several other clans. All animals resided in the Masai Mara National Reserve. Antibodies to CDV, FIV, FPLV/CPV, FECV/FIPV, FCV, and FHV1 were present in 47%, 3.5%, 81%, 36%, 72%, and 0.5% of study hyenas, respectively. Antibody prevalence was greater in adults for FIV and FECV/FIPV, and being a female of high social rank was a risk factor for FIV. Hyenas near human habitation appeared to be at lower risk to have CDV, FIV, and FECV/FIPV antibodies, whereas being near human habitation increased the risk for FPLV/CPV antibodies. Canine (distemper virus and FECV/FIPV antibody prevalence varied considerably over time, whereas FIV, FPLV/CPV, and FCV had a stable, apparently endemic temporal pattern. These results indicate that hyenas might play a role in the ecology of these viruses in the Serengeti ecosystem. The effect of these viruses on hyena health should be further investigated. The lower prevalence of CDV antibody-positive hyenas near human habitation suggests that reservoirs for CDV other than domestic dogs are present in the Serengeti ecosystem.

      Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is rare, but the most severe of the mosquito-borne encephalitides in the United States with a high case fatality rate of 30%. Here, we present a patient with EEE. EEE virus causes sporadic human disease in the Eastern parts of the United States, but the case we describe was a Scottish tourist who acquired the disease from mosquito bites while in holiday in the United States. This is a first report of an imported case to Europe.

      To estimate population exposure of apes and Old World monkeys in Africa to enteroviruses (EVs), we conducted a seroepidemiologic study of serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies against 3 EV types. Detection of species A, B, and D EVs infecting wild chimpanzees demonstrates their potential widespread circulation in primates.

      Enteroviruses (EVs), members of the family Picornaviridae, are a genetically and antigenically diverse range of viruses causing acute infections in humans and several Old World monkey (OWM) species. Despite their known wide distribution in primates, nothing is currently known about the occurrence, frequency, and genetic diversity of enteroviruses infecting apes. To investigate this, 27 chimpanzee and 27 gorilla fecal samples collected from undisturbed jungle areas with minimal human contact in Cameroon were screened for EVs. Four chimpanzee samples were positive, but none of the gorilla samples were positive. Genetic characterization of the VP1, VP4, and partial VP2 genes, the 5' untranslated region, and partial 3Dpol sequences enabled chimpanzee-derived EVs to be identified as (i) the species A type, EV76, (ii) a new species D type assigned as EV111, along with a human isolate from the Democratic Republic of Congo previously described by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses, and (iii) a new species B type (assigned as EV110) most closely related to, although a distinct type from, the SA5 isolate recovered from a vervet monkey. The identification of EVs infecting chimpanzees related to those circulating in human and OWM populations provides evidence for cross-species transmission of EVs between primates. However, the direction of transfer and the existence of primate sources of zoonotic enterovirus infections in humans require further investigation of population exposure and more extensive characterization of EVs circulating in wild ape populations.

      Identified in 1998, Ljungan virus (LV; Picornaviridae) causes type 1 diabetes-like symptoms and myocarditis in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from Sweden and Denmark, and may be a zoonotic agent of several important diseases (e.g., intrauterine fetal death, type 1 diabetes, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and myocarditis). Using a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and sequence analysis, we detected LV in bank voles, and for the first time, in yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) collected during 2006 from a site in northern Italy. The global distribution of LV and its role as a mammalian pathogen deserve further attention.

      Henipaviruses are emerging RNA viruses of fruit bat origin that can cause fatal encephalitis in man. Ghanaian fruit bats (megachiroptera) were tested for antibodies to henipaviruses. Using a Luminex multiplexed microsphere assay, antibodies were detected in sera of Eidolon helvum to both Nipah (39%, 95% confidence interval: 27-51%) and Hendra (22%, 95% CI: 11-33%) viruses. Virus neutralization tests further confirmed seropositivity for 30% (7/23) of Luminex positive serum samples. Our results indicate that henipavirus is present within West Africa.

      An oncornavirus isolated from a squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) lung culture has a density of 1.16 to 1.17 grams per milliliter, contains 70S RNA, and has an RNA-directed DNA polymerase that prefers Mg2+ over Mn2+ in an assay in which polyribocytidylate - oligodeoxyguanylate (12-18) is used as a synthetic template. Morphologically, the virus resembles Mason-Pfizer monkey virus but is antigenically distinct from this virus. The virus grows in cells of human, chimpanzee, rhesus monkey, canine, and mink origin, but not cells of squirrel monkey origin. On the basis of its properties, the newly isolated virus can be classified as a retravirus.

      The DNA of herpesvirus pan, a primate B-lymphotropic herpesvirus, shares about 40% well-conserved sequence relatedness with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and herpesvirus papio DNAs. Labeled cloned fragments from the EBV recombinant DNA library were cross hybridized to blots of EcoRI, XbaI, and BamHI restriction endonuclease fragments of herpesvirus pan DNA to identify and map homologous sequences in the herpesvirus pan genome. Regions of colinear homology were demonstrated between 6 x 10(6) daltons and 108 x 10(6) daltons in the DNAs. The structural organization of herpesvirus pan DNA was similar to the format of Epstein-Barr virus and herpesvirus papio DNAs. The DNA consists of two domains of largely unique sequence complexity, a segment US of 9 x 10(6) daltons and a segment UL of 88 x 10(6) daltons. US and UL are separated by a variable number of tandem repetitions of a sequence IR (2 x 10(6) daltons). There was homology between DNA which mapped at 26 to 28 x 10(6) daltons and 93 to 95 x 10(6) daltons in UL. The terminal reiteration component, TR, of herpesvirus pan DNA and sequences which mapped to the left of 6 x 10(6) daltons and to the right of 108 x 10(6) daltons had no detectable homology with the corresponding regions of Epstein-Barr virus DNA.

      Inoculation of the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) with a small dose of a St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus strain isolated in Ohio indicated that the big brown bat was susceptible to infection. The virus was maintained in the bats through hibernation (70 days), and the bats developed a viremia within 4 days of arousal from hibernation (105 days after inoculation). A field survey of 390 big brown bats and little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) conducted in 5 regions of Ohio during 1979 to 1981 revealed a SLE virus-neutralizing antibody prevalence of 9%. Cohabitation of natural caves and abandoned mineshafts in Ohio by Culex pipiens mosquitoes, big brown bats, and little brown bats was also documented. Demonstration of a 9% prevalence rate of neutralizing antibody to SLE virus in big brown bats and little brown bats in Ohio during a nonepizootic period indicated that the bat may be involved in the maintenance of SLE virus in enzootic foci and could have a role in dissemination of SLE virus to epizootic foci.

      Over 5 years (2000-2004), populations of small mammals from a rural landscape in southern Moravia (Czech Republic) were investigated for the presence of Tula virus (TULV) antigen using the ELISA set Hantagnost. In total, 1566 individuals from 10 species were examined. The prevalence in the common vole (Microtus arvalis Pallas 1778), the main reservoir of TULV, was 10% (n = 871). The prevalence of TULV antigen increases with its population numbers. The highest number of TULV antigen-positive common voles was found in set-aside plots and winter crops, such as rape and winter wheat. All these habitats are important for common vole overwintering. Older and heavier individuals were more often hantavirus antigen positive. From the other small mammal species, 186 pygmy field mice (Apodemus uralensis Pallas, 1811) were examined, of which 3 were positive, which represents the first hantavirus antigen positive record for this species, and of 195 wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus Linnaeus, 1758) only 1 was positive. The remaining five rodent species (Apodemus flavicollis Melchior, 1834, Mus musculus Linnaeus, 1758, Micromys minutus Pallas, 1771, Myodes glareolus Schreber, 1780, Microtus subterraneus de Sélys-Longchamps, 1836) and two Soricomorpha (Sorex araneus Linnaeus, 1758, Sorex minutus Linnaeus, 1766) were hantavirus antigen negative.

      A new strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was isolated from pooled gut suspensions from an epizootic of lethal enteritis in newborn mice. Negative-contrast electron microscopy showed an abundance of coronavirus particles in the intestinal contents and intestinal epithelium of moribund mice. We found no other virus in the epizootic. Dams seroconverted to MHV polyvalent antigen and to the agent isolated, but did not develop antibodies to other known mouse pathogens. Virus propagated in NCTC-1469 tissue culture produced enteric disease in suckling mice but not fatal diarrhea; the dams of these mice also developed antibodies to MHV and to the isolates. By complement fixation, single radial hemolysis, and quantal neutralization tests, we found the isolates antigenically most closely related to MHV-S, unilaterally related to MHV-JHM, and more distantly related to MHV-1, MHV-3, MHV-A59, and human coronavirus OC-43. We also studied cross-reactions among the murine and human coronaviruses in detail. Tissues of infected newborn mice were examined by light microscopy, thin-section electron microscopy, and frozen-section indirect immunofluorescence, revealing that viral antigen, virus particles, and pathological changes were limited to the intestinal tract. We have designated our isolates as MHV-S/CDC.

      The ancestors of the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV-1 and HIV-2) may have evolved from a reservoir of African nonhuman primate lentiviruses, termed simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV). None of the SIV strains characterized so far are closely related to HIV-1. HIV-2, however, is closely related to SIV (SIVmac) isolated from captive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). SIV infection of feral Asian macaques has not been demonstrated by serological surveys. Thus, macaques may have acquired SIV in captivity by cross-species transmission from an SIV-infected African primate. Sooty mangabeys (Cercocebus atys), an African primate species indigenous to West Africa, however, are infected with SIV (SIVsm) both in captivity and in the wild (P. Fultz, personal communication). We have molecularly cloned and sequenced SIVsm and report here that it is closely related to SIVmac and HIV-2. These results suggest that SIVsm has infected macaques in captivity and humans in West Africa and evolved as SIVmac and HIV-2, respectively.

      The complete M segment sequences of hantaviruses amplified from tissues of a patient with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the northeastern United States and from white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, from New York were 99% identical and differed from those of Four Corners virus by 23%. The serum of this patient failed to recognize a conserved, immunodominant epitope of the Four Corners virus G1 glycoprotein. Collectively, these findings indicate that P. leucopus harbors a genetically and antigenically distinct hantavirus that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

      Results in entomological and vertebrate host investigations made during dual outbreaks of Mayaro (MAY) and yellow fever (YF) viruses in Belterra, Pará, Brazil in 1978 are reported. Over 9,000 insects representing 26 species were assayed in 396 pools for the presence of arboviruses. Pools of Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar yielded the only isolates of either MAY or YF virus. The minimum field infection rate for nine isolates of MAY virus from Hg. janthinomys was 1:82, and for two isolates of YF virus was 1:368. Analysis of collection data showed Hg. janthinomys to be attracted to man as a blood source and present in all habitats sampled, although most abundant in the forest canopy. Twelve hundred bird sera and 584 mammal sera were tested by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) tests for antibody to MAY virus. Highest MAY antibody prevalence rates were found among marmosets (Calithrix argentata, 32 positive of 119 tested, 27%). Mayaro virus was also isolated from the blood of a sylvan marmoset captured at the peak of the MAY virus outbreak. Experimental infection of marmosets with MAY virus confirmed that a substantial viremia follows infection with this virus. Marmosets were also found with HI antibody to YF virus (5/119, 4%). The results presented indicate that Hg. janthinomys was the principal vector of both MAY and YF viruses and that marmosets were the main amplifying hosts for MAY virus, and perhaps for YF virus as well.

      The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of bovine torovirus (BoTV) in bovine fecal samples from diarrhea cases submitted to the Ohio Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ADDL) and to assess if a relationship exists between BoTV and the other enteric pathogens detected. From November 1999 to May 2001, 259 specimens from 53 calves (< or = 6 months old), 27 young adults (52 years), 125 adults (> or = 2 years), and 54 animals of unknown age were examined by an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay developed to detect BoTV. Testing for other enteric pathogens was performed by ADDL, and the results were analyzed with the BoTV data. The BoTV was detected using ELISA or RT-PCR in 9.7% (25/259) of the clinical samples, 56% (14/25) of which were from calves (P < 0.001) representing 26.4% (14/53) of the calves tested. Of the BoTV-positive calves, 71% (10/14) were less than 3 weeks of age. In 11/25 positive specimens, BoTV was the only pathogen detected among those examined. Other enteric organisms detected alone or in combination with BoTV in calf samples were rotavirus, coronavirus, Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.; but no consistent association between BoTV and these organisms was observed. In summary, BoTV was detected in fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea, principally in young calves less than 3 weeks of age. Future studies of infectious diarrhea in cattle should also include assays for this etiologic agent.

      While viral infections and their impact are well studied in domestic cats, only limited information is available on their occurrence in free-ranging lions. The goals of the present study were (i) to investigate the prevalence of antibodies to feline calicivirus (FCV), herpesvirus (FHV), coronavirus (FCoV), parvovirus (FPV), and immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen in 311 serum samples collected between 1984 and 1991 from lions inhabiting Tanzania's national parks and (ii) to evaluate the possible biological importance and the interrelationship of these viral infections. Antibodies to FCV, never reported previously in free-ranging lions, were detected in 70% of the sera. In addition, a much higher prevalence of antibodies to FCoV (57%) was found than was previously reported in Etosha National Park and Kruger National Park. Titers ranged from 25 to 400. FeLV antigen was not detectable in any of the serum samples. FCoV, FCV, FHV, and FIV were endemic in the Serengeti, while a transient elevation of FPV titers pointed to an outbreak of FPV infection between 1985 and 1987. Antibody titers to FPV and FCV were highly prevalent in the Serengeti (FPV, 75%; FCV, 67%) but not in Ngorongoro Crater (FPV, 27%; FCV, 2%). These differences could be explained by the different habitats and biological histories of the two populations and by the well-documented absence of immigration of lions from the Serengeti plains into Ngorongoro Crater after 1965. These observations indicate that, although the pathological potential of these viral infections seemed not to be very high in free-ranging lions, relocation of seropositive animals by humans to seronegative lion populations must be considered very carefully.

      In the United States, Bayou virus (BAYV) ranks second only to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) in terms of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) incidents, having been confirmed in cases from Texas and Louisiana since its discovery in 1994. This study on BAYV infection among sympatric, non-oryzomyine rodents (""spillover"") in Freeport, TX, is the first to link patterns of hantavirus interspecific spillover with the spatiotemporal ecology of the primary host (marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris). Mark-recapture and/or harvest methods were employed from March 2002 through May 2004 in two macrohabitat types. Rodent blood samples were screened for the presence of IgG antibody to BAYV antigen by IFA after which Ab-positive blood, saliva, and urine were analyzed for the presence of viral RNA by nested RT-PCR. From 727 non-oryzomyine captures, five seropositive (but not viral RNA positive) individuals were detected: one each of Baiomys taylori, Peromyscus leucopus, and Reithrodontomys fulvescens; and two Sigmodon hispidus. Spillover hosts were not associated with macrohabitat where O. palustris abundance, density, or seroprevalence was highest. Rather, spillover occurred in the macrohabitat indicative of greater overall disturbance (as indicated by grazing and exotic plant diversity) and overall biodiversity. Spillover occurred during periods of high seroprevalence detected elsewhere within the study region. Spillover locations differed significantly from all other capture locations in terms of percent water, shrub, and grass cover. Although greater habitat and mammal diversity of old-fields may serve to reduce seroprevalence levels by tempering intraspecific contacts between rice rats, greater diversity also may create an ecologically opportunistic setting for BAYV spillover. Impacts of varying levels of disturbance and biodiversity on transmission dynamics represent a vastly uncharacterized component of the evolutionary ecology of hantaviruses.

      Tonate virus, subtype IIIB of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex, was first isolated in 1973 in French Guiana, South America. However, very little is known about its pathogenicity; it was considered to be responsible for only mild dengue-like syndromes. In 1998, a 2-month-old boy living along the Oyapock river in French Guiana was hospitalized for fever and generalized status myoclonus, and despite treatment the patient died 72 h after admission. Testing showed the presence of IgM specific for viruses of the VEE complex. A sensitive seminested polymerase chain reaction derived from a previous study was developed to detect viruses from the VEE complex, since no virus could be recovered from clinical specimens cultured on mosquito cells or from intracerebral inoculation into newborn mice. The genome of a virus from the VEE complex was detected in postmortem brain biopsies, and Tonate virus was identified by direct sequencing. This is the first reported case of human encephalitis due to Tonate virus.

      Two hantavirus strains, MF43 and MF113, isolated from Microtus fortis trapped in the Khabarovsk region of far-eastern Russia, were analysed by direct nucleotide sequencing of PCR generated fragments of the M and S segments, by immunofluorescence and by focus reduction neutralization tests (FRNT). The nucleotide sequences revealed that the two isolates were closely related to each other but distinct from all other hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the M and S segments showed that the MF strains form a separate branch in the Hantavirus tree, positioned between the branches of Prospect Hill and Puumala viruses. The strains were shown to be serologically distinct from the other hantavirus serotypes by FRNT using immune rabbit sera. Puumala virus was the closest relative, both genetically and serologically. We propose that this new hantavirus serotype should be named Khabarovsk (KBR).

      Outbreaks of infection due to a parapoxvirus were reported on eight New Zealand deer farms. Scabby lesions were seen variably on the muzzle, lips, face, ears and neck of red deer (Cervus elaphus) with morbidity rates reaching 100%. On three farms multifocal lesions were also present on the velvet. Deaths were reported on two properties where the lesions were extensive and secondary bacterial infections had occurred. On one of these farms multifactorial disease was suspected. Poxvirus particles were seen by negative contrast electron microscopy in scab material from all eight properties. Morphologically the deer virus resembled a parapoxvirus, but restriction endonuclease analysis showed its DNA fragment patterns were distinct from those of orf (contagious ecthyma) virus.

      We retrospectively investigated two outbreaks of encephalitis in Meherpur and Naogaon, Bangladesh, which occurred in 2001 and 2003. We collected serum samples from persons who were ill, their household contacts, randomly selected residents, hospital workers, and various animals. Cases were classified as laboratory confirmed or probable. We identified 13 cases (4 confirmed, 9 probable) in Meherpur; 7 were in persons in two households. Patients were more likely than nonpatients to have close contact with other patients or have contact with a sick cow. In Naogaon, we identified 12 cases (4 confirmed, 8 probable); 7 were in persons clustered in 2 households. Two Pteropus bats had antibodies for Nipah virus. Samples from hospital workers were negative for Nipah virus antibodies. These outbreaks, the first since 1999, suggest that transmission may occur through close contact with other patients or from exposure to a common source. Surveillance and enhancement of diagnostic capacity to detect Nipah virus infection are recommended.

      Since simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was found to be the source of the human AIDS pandemic, a major goal has been to characterize the diversity of SIV strains in the wild and to assess their potential for crossover into humans. In the present study, SIV was isolated from a seropositive drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus) and three seropositive mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) by using macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Full-length sequences were obtained from a drill and mandrill and designated SIVdrl1FAO and SIVmnd5440, respectively. A 182-bp fragment of the pol genes of the two remaining mandrill SIV isolates was also analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that SIVdrl1FAO formed a monophyletic clade with SIVmnd5440 and SIVmndM14, recently designated SIVmnd type 2. Both the SIVdrl and SIVmnd type 2 genomes carried a vpx gene and appeared to share a common ancestor with SIVrcm in the 5' region of the genome and with SIVmndGB1 (type 1) in the 3' region of the genome. A statistically significant recombination breakpoint was detected at the beginning of envelope, suggesting that the viruses were descendents of the same recombinant. Phylogenetic analysis of vpx and vpr genes demonstrated that the vpx genes formed a monophyletic cluster that grouped with vpr from SIVagm. In addition, both SIVdrl1FAO and SIVmnd5440 replicated in human PBMC and therefore could pose a risk of transmission to the human population.

      Bhanja virus (BHAV) is pathogenic for young domestic ruminants and also for humans, causing fever and affections of the central nervous system. This generally neglected arbovirus of the family Bunyaviridae is transmitted by metastriate ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis, Dermacentor, Hyalomma, Rhipicephalus, Boophilus, and Amblyomma. Geographic distribution of BHAV covers southern and Central Asia, Africa, and southern (partially also central) Europe. Comparative biogeographic study of eight known natural foci of BHAV infections in Europe (in Italy, Croatia, Bulgaria, Slovakia) has revealed their common features. (1) submediterranean climatic pattern with dry growing season and wet mild winter (or microlimatically similar conditions, e.g., limestone karst areas in central Europe), (2) xerothermic woodland-grassland ecosystem, with plant alliances Quercetalia pubescentis, Festucetalia valesiacae, and Brometalia erecti, involving pastoral areas, (3) presence of at least one of the tick species Haemaphysalis punctata, Dermacentor marginatus, Rhipicephalus bursa, and/or Hyalomma marginatum, and (4) presence of >/=60% of the 180 BHAV bioindicator (157 plant, 4 ixodid tick, and 19 vertebrate spp.). On that basis, Greece, France (southern, including Corsica), Albania, Spain, Hungary, European Turkey, Ukraine (southern), Switzerland (southern), Austria (southeastern), Germany (southern), Moldova, and European Russia (southern) have been predicted as additional European regions where BHAV might occur.

      West Nile virus causes sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease in Europe (western Mediterranean and southern Russia in 1962-64, Belarus and Ukraine in the 1970s and 1980s, Romania in 1996-97, Czechland in 1997, and Italy in 1998). Environmental factors, including human activities, that enhance population densities of vector mosquitoes (heavy rains followed by floods, irrigation, higher than usual temperature, or formation of ecologic niches that enable mass breeding of mosquitoes) could increase the incidence of West Nile fever.

      Nonhuman primates are widely used in biomedical research because of their genetic, anatomic, and physiologic similarities to humans. In this setting, human contact directly with macaques or with their tissues and fluids sometimes occurs. Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (B virus), an alphaherpesvirus endemic in Asian macaques, is closely related to herpes simplex virus (HSV). Most macaques carry B virus without overt signs of disease. However, zoonotic infection with B virus in humans usually results in fatal encephalomyelitis or severe neurologic impairment. Although the incidence of human infection with B virus is low, a death rate of >70% before the availability of antiviral therapy makes this virus a serious zoonotic threat. Knowledge of the clinical signs and risk factors for human B-virus disease allows early initiation of antiviral therapy and prevents severe disease or death.

      Published assays that use TaqMan PCR are consistently sensitive, rapid, and readily transferable. Here we describe a TaqMan PCR-based method for the detection of rabies virus (RV) RNA in tissue samples. We show that the method has an acceptable linear range, is both sensitive and specific, and, importantly, correlates with the concentration of infectious virus. In addition, the levels of RV-specific amplification are adjustable according to the levels of an endogenous control (beta-actin mRNA), allowing the calculation of comparable quantities. We tested the capacity of this assay to cope with target sequence variations. The number of sequence mismatches between gene-specific oligonucleotides and the target sequence significantly affects amplification (P < 0.001), and point mutations at the center of the probe can result in false-negative results through the prevention of probe binding and subsequent fluorescence. This study demonstrates that the genetic heterogeneity of RVs may prove a serious obstacle in the development of a diagnostic assay based on TaqMan PCR; however, the quantification of RV levels may prove to be a valuable application of this assay.

      Simian varicella virus (SVV; Cercopithecine herpesvirus 9) is a naturally occurring herpesvirus of nonhuman primates. Here we present the clinical, pathologic, and virologic findings from 2 cases of SVV in adult female pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina). The initial case presented with hyperthermia and a diffuse inguinal rash which spread centripetally, progressing to vesiculoulcerative dermatitis of the trunk, face, and extremities. At 96 h after presentation, the animal was anorexic and lethargic and had oral and glossal ulcerations. Euthanasia was elected in light of the macaque's failure to respond to clinical treatment. Seven days after the first case was identified, a second macaque presented with a vesicular rash and was euthanized. Gross necropsy lesions for both cases included vesicular, ulcerative dermatitis with mucocutaneous extension and hepatic necrosis; the initial case also demonstrated necrohemorrhagic gastroenterocolitis and multifocal splenic necrosis. Histology confirmed herpetic viral infection with abundant intranuclear inclusion bodies. Immunofluorescence assays detected antibodies specific for SVV. PCR assays of vesicular fluid, tissue, and blood confirmed SVV and excluded varicella-zoster virus (Human herpesvirus 3). Serology for Macacine herpesvirus 1 (formerly Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1), poxvirus (monkeypox), and rubella was negative. Banked serum samples confirmed SVV exposure and seroconversion. Investigation into the epidemiology of the seroconversion demonstrated a SVV colony prevalence of 20%. The described cases occurred in animals with reconstituted immune systems (after total-body irradiation) and demonstrate the clinical effects of infection with an endemic infectious agent in animals with a questionable immune status.

      Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) belong to a genetically and antigenically diverse class of retroviruses that naturally infect a wide range of nonhuman primates (NHPs) and can also be transmitted to humans occupationally exposed to NHPs. Current serologic detection of SFV infection requires separate Western blot (WB) testing by using two different SFV antigens [SFV(AGM) (African green monkey) and SFV(CPZ) (chimpanzee)]. However, this method is labor intensive and validation is limited to only small numbers of NHPs. To facilitate serologic SFV testing, we developed a WB assay that combines antigens from both SFV(AGM) and SFV(CPZ). The combined-antigen WB (CA-WB) assay was validated with 145 serum samples from 129 NHPs (32 African and Asian species) and 16 humans, all with known SFV infection status determined by PCR. Concordant CA-WB results were obtained for all 145 PCR-positive or -negative primate and human specimens, giving the assay a 100% sensitivity and specificity. In addition, no reactivity was observed in sera from persons positive for human immunodeficiency virus or human T cell lymphotropic virus (HIV/HTLV) (n = 25) or HIV/HTLV-negative U.S. blood donors (n = 100). Using the CA-WB assay, we screened 360 sera from 43 Old World primate species and found an SFV prevalence of about 68% in both African and Asian primates. We also isolated SFV from the blood of four seropositive primates (Allenopithecus nigroviridis, Trachypithecus françoisi, Hylobates pileatus, and H. leucogenys) not previously known to be infected with SFV. Phylogenetic analysis of integrase sequences from these isolates confirmed that all four SFVs represent new, distinct, and highly divergent lineages. These results demonstrate the ability of the CA-WB assay to detect infection in a large number of NHP species, including previously uncharacterized infections with divergent SFVs.

      At the onset of the 2003 US monkeypox outbreak, virologic data were unavailable regarding which animal species were involved with virus importation and/or subsequent transmission to humans and whether there was a risk for establishment of zoonotic monkeypox in North America. Similarly, it was unclear which specimens would be best for virus testing. Monkeypox DNA was detected in at least 33 animals, and virus was cultured from 22. Virus-positive animals included three African species associated with the importation event (giant pouched rats, Cricetomys spp.; rope squirrels, Funisciuris sp.; and dormice, Graphiuris sp.). Virologic evidence from North American prairie dogs (Cynomys sp.) was concordant with their suspected roles as vectors for human monkeypox. Multiple tissues were found suitable for DNA detection and/or virus isolation. These data extend the potential host range for monkeypox virus infection and supports concern regarding the potential for establishment in novel reservoir species and ecosystems.

      In the last 5 years, there has been only one reported human case of West Nile virus (WNV) disease in northern Mexico. To determine if the virus was still circulating in this region, equine and entomological surveillance for WNV was conducted in the state of Nuevo Leon in northern Mexico in 2006 and 2007. A total of 203 horses were serologically assayed for antibodies to WNV using an epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA). Seroprevalences for WNV in horses sampled in 2006 and 2007 were 26% and 45%, respectively. Mosquito collections in 2007 produced 7365 specimens representing 15 species. Culex mosquitoes were screened for WNV RNA and other genera (Mansonia, Anopheles, Aedes, Psorophora and Uranotaenia) were screened for flaviviruses using reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR. Two pools consisting of Culex spp. mosquitoes contained WNV RNA. Molecular species identification revealed that neither pool included Culex quinquefasciatus (Say) (Diptera:Culicidae) complex mosquitoes. No evidence of flaviviruses was found in the other mosquito genera examined. These data provide evidence that WNV is currently circulating in northern Mexico and that non-Cx. quinquefasciatus spp. mosquitoes may be participating in the WNV transmission cycle in this region.

      Serum samples from two leopard cats (Felis bengalensis) and four Formosan gem-faced civets (Paguma larvata taivana) in Taiwan, September 1995, and nine leopard cats in Vietnam, August and December 1997, were examined for the prevalence of antibodies against feline parvovirus, feline herpesvirus type 1, feline calicivirus and feline immunodeficiency virus. All civets and nine of 11 leopard cats were shown to have antibodies against feline parvovirus (FPV), and FPV's were isolated from mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood of the six leopard cats.

      During the epidemic of Rift Valley fever (RVF) that occurred in Egypt and other areas of North Africa in 1977, the virus was isolated from various species of domestic animal and rats (Rattus rattus frugivorus) as well as man. The highest number of RVF virus isolates were obtained from sheep; only one isolate was recovered from each of the other species tested, viz. cow, camel, goat, horse, and rat. RVF virus was reisolated from both camel and horse sera, apparently for the first time.

      Astroviral infection has been described as one of the causes of porcine diarrhoeal disease. Here we describe the detection of astrovirus-like particles by electron microscopy in a diarrhoeal specimen. Furthermore, a cytopathic virus was isolated and propagated in an established porcine kidney cell line, PK-15. Reverse transcription and PCR performed with astrovirus-specific primers amplified a product with the expected size. Sequencing of the PCR product revealed that the virus observed by electron microscopy and propagated in the porcine cell line is an astrovirus, showing 86% identity at the nucleotide level with the only known porcine astrovirus, PAstV. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the novel isolate, Sb4685, together with PAstV in a broad clade comprising mammalian astroviruses.

      A serologic survey was conducted on 628 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in 1976 and 1979-1980. Tests for antibodies to the etiologic agents of infectious bovine rhinotrancheitis (IBR), parainfluenza 3 (PI3), leptospirosis, and brucellosis produced positive results of 15%, 20%, 3% and 0%, respectively. Adult deer had significantly higher prevalence of antibodies to IBR virus and PI3 virus than fawns. These data provide a basis for monitoring these disease agents in Minnesota's white-tailed deer.

      Serum samples from 54 monkeys were collected from healthy individuals in a monkey farm in Luzon island, Philippines, in 1999, and examined by IgM-capture ELISA and indirect IgG ELISA for the presence of dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE) and chikungunya (CHIK) viruses. The positive rates for IgM ELISA were 3.7, 35.2 and 14.8% against DEN, JE and CHIK, respectively. Higher positive rates were obtained when indirect IgG ELISA was used: 100% against flaviviruses (JE or DEN) and 59.3% against CHIK virus. The results indicate a high prevalence of flavivirus infections such as JE and DEN, and a lesser prevalence of CHIK virus infections, among monkeys in the Philippines. These findings suggest possible sylvatic transmission cycles of these viruses.

      We have investigated the incidence of Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs) associated with outbreaks of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in Osaka City, Japan, since April 1996 using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and electron microscopy methods. From the results of the first 3 years, between April 1996 and March 1999, we previously reported that multiple genetic types of NLVs were detected in 71.9% of outbreaks using RT-PCR with Ando's primers except for one outbreak [Iritani et al., 2000]. However, during the 1999-2000 season, NLV outbreak strains, which could not be detected by RT-PCR with Ando's primers, were increased. From probe typing and sequence analysis, 76.9% of these undetectable outbreak strains were classified into the P1-B type and the others were untypable. These untypable strains were closely related with Alphatron type strains detected in the Netherlands. The P2-B probe type of the NLV outbreak strains was predominant (88.2%) in the 1999-2000 season. The phylogram based on the 81 nucleotide sequences from these P2-B outbreak strains formed 2 clusters closely related with Lordsdale virus. The dominant genetic type of the P2-B outbreak strains, during the 1996-1997 season in Osaka City, belonged in one of these 2 clusters. These findings of the emergence of NLVs escaping the RT-PCR method strongly indicated the importance of probe typing and sequence analysis to survey NLV infections. Our surveillance of NLV infection in the outbreaks, for these 4 years, showed that the predominant probe type and dominant genetic type of NLV outbreak strains changed each season.

      Infection with a simian retrovirus (STLV-I) closely related to human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) was investigated in non-human primates living in their native countries in Africa and Asia. Serum antibodies cross-reacting with HTLV-I antigens were detected in 85 of 567 non-human primates of 30 species. Seropositive animals were found among African green monkeys, olive baboons, Sykes' monkeys, mandrills and patas monkeys in several countries in Africa, and cynomolgus monkeys, Celebes macaques and siamangs in Indonesia. The frequency of seropositivity was much higher in adult than in young African green monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys and Celebes macaques. STLV-Is were isolated by establishing II lines of virus-producing lymphoid cells in the presence of interleukin-2 from 5 species of seropositive non-human primates, i.e. the African green monkey, Sykes' monkey, Celebes macaque, cynomolgus monkey and siamang. All these cell lines had T-cell markers and Tac antigen, and the cell lines from the African green monkey and Sykes' monkeys were Leu2a+ while those from other species were Leu3a+. These cell lines expressed viral antigens reacting with human sera from adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against p19 and p24 of HTLV-I core proteins, and produced virus particles having RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity. Cellular DNAs from these cell lines contained provirus sequences homologous to HTLV-I, shown by Southern blot hybridization. The restriction patterns of these provirus genomes were different from those of HTLV-I and were also dissimilar in the different species.

      A combination of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA) application and excisional wounding on the lingual tips of Syrian Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) induces dysplastic and malignant mucosal lesions. Papillomavirus genus-specific antigen and viral particles, measuring 55 nm in diameter, were demonstrated in the nuclei of squamous cells of dysplastic lesions showing koilocytotic change. In this study, we cloned a circular genome at a single Kpnl site from one of these dysplastic lesions. The genomic sequence of this clone, consisting of 7647 bp, was shown to be that of a novel papillomavirus with a conserved genomic organization. We named the new virus hamster oral papillomavirus (HOPV). All dysplastic lesions induced by this combination of DMBA application and excisional wounding contained viral DNA. Although Southern blot hybridization analysis could not detect the HOPV genome, PCR analysis demonstrated the latent HOPV genome in the tongue and skin of an untreated hamster. These results suggest that latently present HOPV genome is reactivated by the DMBA/wounding procedures. Lingual HOPV infection may be an important model for gaining insight into the interactions between papillomavirus infection, chemical carcinogens and physical irritations in carcinogenesis or malignant transformation.

      Borna disease (BD) was diagnosed in a 2-year-old male alpaca with a history of chronic suppressed sexual desire and acute stretching convulsions. Microscopical examination of the central nervous system revealed non-purulent meningoencephalitis with mononuclear perivascular cuffing. The diagnosis was confirmed by immunohistochemistry, in-situ hybridization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of PCR products and alignment with known Borna disease virus sequences. Serological screening of the herd was performed. This is the first detailed report of naturally occurring BD in alpacas.

      The endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia virus DNA content and integration sites were characterized for 54 inbred strains and substrains of mice by restriction enzyme digestion, Southern blotting, and hybridization with an ecotropic murine leukemia virus DNA-specific probe. More than 75% of these strains carried endogenous ecotropic proviruses which were located in at least 29 distinct integration sites in chromosomes of Mus musculus. Fourteen of these proviruses have been assigned specific locus designations. Most, but not all, of the endogenous ecotropic proviruses were structurally indistinguishable by this analysis from the prototype AKR ecotropic virus, and the distribution of these proviruses followed known relationships among the inbred strains and substrains of mice. These results suggest that, in general, viral DNA integration preceded the establishment of inbred mouse strains and that these integrations are relatively stable.

      The epidemiology of herpesvirus papio, a lymphocryptovirus similar to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), was studied in a captive colony of >1900 baboons. Herpesvirus papio IgG antibody titers were measured by IFA. In total, 438 specimens from 296 baboons were assessed, including 116 serial specimens from 52 juveniles and 6 infants studied monthly for 1 year following birth and at age 18 months. Maternally derived antibody reached a nadir at 4 months of age. About 75% of animals at 12 months of age and >95% of animals after age 24 months demonstrated serologic evidence of herpesvirus papio infection. After age 3 years, the geometric mean titer was 1:60-75. The epidemiology of herpesvirus papio infection in baboons closely parallels that of EBV infection in humans. An animal model of lymphocryptovirus infection will facilitate investigations of human lymphocryptovirus biology.

      Reports of a possible relationship between Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (AMDV) and human infection are rare. However, 2 mink farmers with vascular disease and microangiopathy similar to that in mink with Aleutian disease were found to have AMDV-specific antibodies and AMDV DNA. These findings raise the suspicion that AMDV may play a role in human disease.

      Members of the Order Chiroptera are the natural reservoirs of lyssaviruses and play an important role in the transmission of rabies to animals and humans. In this present study, the seroprevalence for rabies virus was determined for bats sampled from four southern provinces on the Chinese mainland. A total of 685 bats of 8 species representing 4 families were collected from 10 sites, and were tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated protein A/G mixture and viral neutralization test. Rabies antibody response was only detected from three bat species (Rousettus leschenaulti, Rhinolophus blythi, and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). The overall rabies seroconversion rate was only 2.2% (15/685). Of the 15 positive sera, 13 (12 fruit bats and 1 insectivorous bat) were indirect fluorescent antibody test positive, and two insectivorous bats were virus neutralization positive when tested by the modified fluorescent antibody viral neutralization test, albeit extremely low. To our knowledge, this is the first published report describing rabies seroprevalences from Chinese bats. These results suggest that bats may play a role in the ecology of lyssaviruses in China, and further surveillance for the presence of lyssaviruses in bats should be undertaken throughout the country and extended to other species.

      Small mammals were captured in a Costa Rican dairy farm located in a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) enzootic focus, in order to determine which species were naturally infected by this virus. Monthly captures were performed from March 1989 to February 1990. Eighty-four individuals belonging to the orders Rodentia (n = 52), Insectivora (n = 31) and Marsupialia (n = 1) were captured. Only Sigmodon hispidus had neutralizing antibodies to VSV; among 21 animals, six had antibodies to Indiana, one to New Jersey, and two to both serotypes. In addition, groups of 40 sentinel mice (Mus musculus, strain C3H) were placed in cages distributed throughout the farm. Each group was exposed for 1 mo over a period of 1 yr. None of 312 sentinel mice developed antibodies against either VSV serotype. Based on these results, we believe that S. hispidus might be part of the natural cycle of VSV in this enzootic focus. Caged Mus musculus do not seem appropriate for monitoring VSV activity in this area.

      Elucidation of the phylogenetic origins of simian and human immunodeficiency viruses (SIV and HIV) is fundamental to the understanding of HIV pathogenesis and the spread of AIDS worldwide. In this study, we molecularly characterized multiple SIVAGM isolates from four different African green monkey species (vervet, grivet, sabaeus and tantalus monkeys). Phylogenetic analysis of partial (1 kb) env sequences indicated that all SIVAGM strains cluster together, and that they fall into four distinct sequence sub-groups according to their species of origin. However, alignment of long terminal repeat sequences revealed that SIVs from West African sabaeus monkeys contain a structural feature (a duplication of the transactivation response element) thus far only found in otherwise highly divergent lentiviruses infecting sooty mangabeys (SIVSM) and humans (HIV-2). To determine whether there were additional similarities with the SIVSM/HIV-2 group, a full-length replication competent sabaeus provirus was cloned and sequenced. In phylogenetic trees derived from the central and 3' coding regions, the sabaeus virus clustered with SIVAGM isolates from other African green monkey species. However, in trees derived from the 3' half of gag and the adjacent 5' region of pol, the sabaeus virus grouped with the SIVSM/HIV-2 lineage. These results indicated that the sabaeus virus comprised a mosaic genome which must have resulted from recombination of divergent lentiviruses in the distant past. A second, independent sabaeus isolate exhibited similar phylogenetic relationships, suggesting that all West African green monkey viruses share this complex evolutionary history. Taken together, these results indicate that African green monkeys have been infected with SIVAGM for very long periods of time, and that recombination and cross-species transmission in the wild have contributed to the genetic complexity of primate lentiviruses.

      Colorado tick fever (CTF) virus elicits an acute illness in humans, producing nonspecific flu-like symptoms and a biphasic fever in approximately 50% of patients. The disease is transmitted by the adult Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), and therefore incidence is limited by the habitat and life cycle of that vector. The early symptoms of infection are difficult to distinguish from those of several other agents, especially Rickettsia rickettsii. Serologic testing is usually unable to provide evidence of CTF viral infection during the acute phase because of the late appearance of the various antibodies. Here we report the development and clinical application of a test to diagnose this disease during the acute stages. Oligonucleotide primers to the S2 segment of CTF (Florio) virus were made, and these were used in the amplification of a 528-bp fragment of DNA, transcribed from the double-stranded CTF virus RNA template by reverse transcriptase PCR. RNAs processed from 16 CTF virus isolates yielded similar results when analyzed on agarose gels. These were distinguishable from their antigenic relatives Eyach, S6-14-03, and T5-2092 and from other coltiviruses and an orbivirus but not from the antigenically distinct CTF virus-related isolate 720896. A mouse model demonstrated the utility of this method with whole-blood specimens, and CTF virus was successfully detected in human sera from the initial day of the onset of symptoms to 8 days later. The reverse transcriptase PCR method is a promising tool for the early diagnosis of CTF viral infection, or for ruling out CTF virus as the etiologic agent, in order to facilitate appropriate medical support.

      A large outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) recently occurred in the Chaco region of Paraguay. Using PCR approaches, partial virus genome sequences were obtained from 5 human sera, and spleens from 5 Calomys laucha rodents from the outbreak area. Genetic analysis revealed a newly discovered hantavirus, Laguna Negra (LN) virus, to be associated with the HPS outbreak and established a direct genetic link between the virus detected in the HPS cases and in the C. laucha rodents, implicating them as the primary rodent reservoir for LN virus in Paraguay. Virus isolates were obtained from two C. laucha, and represent the first successful isolation of a pathogenic South American hantavirus. Analysis of the prototype LN virus entire S and M and partial L segment nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed that this virus is unique among the Sigmodontinae-borne clade of hantaviruses. Analysis of PCR fragments amplified from a serum sample from a Chilean HPS patient, who had recently traveled extensively in Bolivia (where C. laucha are known to occur), revealed an LN virus variant that was approximately 15% different at the nucleotide level and identical at the deduced amino acid level relative to the Paraguayan LN virus. These data suggest that LN virus may cause HPS in several countries in this geographic region.

      Arbovirus infection and presence of haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies in small mammals, birds and livestock were examined over a period of five years on the Kano Plain in western Kenya. Eleven isolations were made from mammals and birds. The viruses were identified as Arumowot and Germiston while three different agents could not be shown to be related to 188 African arboviruses. Prevalence of antibodies against arboviruses suspected of occurring in the area was generally low.

      In November 2004, tissues were collected from a hunter-killed white-tailed deer in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana. Bluetongue virus (BTV) was isolated from the tissues; however, the isolate could not be identified as any of the US domestic serotypes. Subsequent testing by virus neutralization using serotype-specific antiserum tentatively identified the isolate as BTV serotype 1 (BTV-1), which had not previously been found in the United States. Primers were designed based on the sequence of an outer capsid protein gene of a South African BTV-1 strain. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing with the BTV-1 primers and product sequencing confirmed the Louisiana isolate as BTV-1. This is the first report of BTV-1 in the United States.

      Reassortment is an important factor in the evolution of segmented genome viruses. For arthropod-borne viruses it is important to determine whether the vertebrate host acts as a site of reassortant virus formation since vertebrates often act as amplifying hosts. Mutants of Thogoto virus, a tick-borne orthomyxo-like virus, were shown to produce wild-type progeny in a dually infected permissive host (hamster), when hamsters were infected with two mutant viruses either by direct inoculation or by oral transmission from infected ticks. Viral dose and time of co-infection of the host affected the incidence of reassortment. This is the first report of reassortment of an arbovirus following infection of a vertebrate host via an arthropod vector.

      There is presently no vaccine to combat African swine fever (ASF), a viral hemorrhagic fever of domestic pigs that causes up to 100% morbidity and mortality in naive, commercial pig populations. In its endemic setting, ASF virus cycles between asymptomatic warthogs and soft ticks, with persistence in exotic locations being ascribed to the almost global distribution of susceptible soft tick and suid hosts. An understanding of the role played by diverse hosts in the epidemiology of this multi-host disease is crucial for effective disease control. Unlike the intensively studied Ornithodoros tick vector, the role of many wild suids remains obscure, despite growing recognition for suid-exclusive virus cycling, without the agency of the argasid tick, at some localities. Because the four wild suid genera, Phacochoerus, Potamochoerus, Hylochoerus, and Sus differ from each other in taxonomy, distribution, ecology, reservoir host potential, virus shedding, ASF symptomology, and domestic-pig contact potential, their role in disease epidemiology is also varied. This first consolidated summary of ASF epidemiology in relation to wild suids summarizes current knowledge and identifies information gaps and future research priorities crucial for formulating effective disease control strategies.

      In early March 1996, Wesselsbron (WSL) virus caused mortality among lambs on a farm near Bultfontein in the northern Free State Province, South Africa. Mosquito collections were therefore undertaken from 27 March to 1 April to collect floodwater Aedes mosquitoes for attempts at virus isolation. In all, 4,732 floodwater Aedes were tested; 5 WSL, 1 Middelburg (MID), and 5 unidentified viruses were isolated from 3,052 Aedes (Neomelaniconion) mcintoshi/luridus (minimum infection rate [MIR] for WSL = 1.63) and 5 WSL, 1 MID, and 3 unidentified viruses from 1,478 Aedes (Ochlerotatus) juppi/caballus (MIR for WSL = 3.38). One of the authors developed WSL fever on 3 April; WSL virus was isolated from his serum, and he developed a titer of 1:640 in the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test and became IgM positive against WSL virus. Among a sample of 44 sheep bled on 4-5 September, 59% were antibody positive by the HI test against WSL and 48% against MID viruses. Mosquito collecting was restricted to 2 discrete, shallow, grassy depressions that were the main floodwater Aedes breeding sites on the farm so they will be investigated further as possible foci of transovarial transmission of WSL and MID viruses.

      A virus isolate was recovered from blood leucocytes of a patient with nephropathia epidemica (NE). Leucocytes were isolated from EDTA-blood by dextran sedimentation and cultured on monolayers of Vero E6 cells in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in roller tubes during the first 72 hours of incubation followed by rolling culture for three weeks in total. Thereafter the first subculture was done in a plastic flask and afterward at at least 6 week intervals. Antigen was first detected after 6 months and 2 weeks of culture. When tested by monoclonal antibodies and patient sera the isolate had the characteristics of a PUU virus. PCR amplification using PUU-specific primers and subsequent partial sequencing of the S and M segments revealed that the Umeå/305/human/95 virus differs from the Finnish PUU Sotkamo rodent prototype virus and is similar but not identical to rodent strains of PUU virus acquired from the same region as the patient isolate. It is we concluded that the first human isolate of the etiologic agent of NE in Scandinavia was recovered from blood leucocytes stimulated with PHA by long-term culture in Vero E6 cells. The isolate belongs to the PUU serotype of hantaviruses as shown by its serologic profile and partial sequencing data.

      The aim of this study was to evaluate the epidemiological situation of swine influenza virus (SIV) infections in different wild boar populations in Germany based on a serological surveillance in some Bundeslaender (federal states) in connection with virological investigations in wild boar shot in Northern Germany (Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, district of Nordvorpommern). Altogether, 1245 sera from wild boar were tested using the hemagglutination inhibition test. The established seroprevalence rate was low (on average 5.2%). Antibodies were only detected against the subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 showing differences between wild boar populations and age classes. The virological investigation of samples derived from lungs of wild boar shot in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, district of Nordvorpommern (n=242), revealed that the virus prevalence (two virologically positive animals, 0.8%) was very low. Based on serological typing, the isolated SIV was identified as subtype H3N2. Molecular biological investigations of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes confirmed this result. This study suggests that SIV infections in wild boar seem to be no serious threat for domestic pigs.

      Vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens have comprised a significant proportion of the emerging infectious diseases in humans in recent decades. The role of many wildlife species as reservoirs for arthropod-borne viral pathogens is poorly understood. We investigated the exposure history of various African wildlife species from the Congo basin to mosquito-borne flaviviruses and alphaviruses by testing archived serum samples. Sera from 24 African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), 34 African elephants (Loxodonta africana), 40 duikers (Cephalophus and Philantomba spp.), 25 mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), 32 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), five Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri), two L'Hoest's monkeys (Cercopithecus lhoesti), two golden monkeys (Cercopithecus kandti), and three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) sampled between 1991 and 2009 were tested for antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV), o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue 2 virus (DENV-2), and yellow fever virus (YFV) by plaque reduction neutralization test. Specific neutralizing antibodies against ONNV were found in African forest buffalo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Gabon, duikers in the DRC, and mandrills in Gabon, providing novel evidence of enzootic circulation of ONNV in these countries. African forest buffalo in the DRC and Gabon also demonstrated evidence of exposure to CHIKV, WNV, and DENV-2, while mandrills in Gabon were antibody positive for CHIKV, DENV-2, WNV, and YFV. All of the elephants tested had a strong neutralizing antibody response to WNV. We also document results from a survey of gorillas for arboviruses, of which 4/32 (13%) had antibody to an alphavirus or flavivirus. Overall, our results demonstrate a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against multiple arboviruses in wildlife in equatorial Africa.

      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to test six different nonbovine ruminant species for five bovine herpesviruses including infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (BoHV-1), bovine herpes mammillitis virus (BoHV-2), Movar-type herpesvirus (BoHV-4), bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BoHV-5), and alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1). Species tested included 56 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), 66 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 20 fallow deer (Dama dama), 16 mouflon (Ovis musimon), 34 domestic sheep, and 44 domestic goats, which were sampled in Hungary in 2003. Tracheal and popliteal lymph nodes collected from these animals were tested for the presence of the five bovine herpesviruses using three nested (two of which were duplex) PCR assays. Three bovine herpesviruses (BoHV-1, -2, and -4) were detected, whereas no evidence of AlHV-1 or BoHV-5 was observed. Prevalence of BoHV-1 ranged from 12% to 47%, and PCR-positive results were observed in all species tested. BoHV-2 was detected from roe deer, red deer, fallow deer, mouflon, and domestic sheep, and the prevalence in these species ranged from 3% to 50%. BoHV-4 was detected in all species, with prevalence ranging from 12% to 69%. Sequenced PCR products were 99-100% identical to bovine herpesviral sequences deposited in the GenBank.

      Two virus strains were isolated by mouse inoculation from blood of Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit-eating bats collected from Kasokero Cave in Uganda. Shortly after these strains were introduced in the laboratory, four additional strains were recovered from laboratory workers who had developed mild to severe illnesses presumably as a result of laboratory infection. Serological studies established that these six isolates are strains of the same virus. Serological tests showed also that this virus is related to Yogue, an unclassified virus.

      Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) is a human type-C RNA tumor virus (retrovirus) previously identified in and isolated from several patients with T-cell leukemias or lymphomas. The known virus isolates from the United States and Japan are closely related and are found in adults with an acute malignancy of mature T cells. A related retrovirus has been found in a patient (Mo) with a somewhat different disease (a T-cell variant of relatively benign hairy cell leukemia). Serum from Mo contains antibodies to the major internal core protein (p24) of HTLV. A T-cell line established from the spleen of Mo expresses HTLV antigens. However, HTLV from Mo is significantly different from all previous HTLV isolates in immunological cross-reactivity tests of p24. The usual prototype HTLV isolate is represented as HTLV-I, and the HTLV from Mo is represented as HTLV-II. Individual members of each subgroup may then be identified by subscript initials of the patient [for example, HTLV-I(CR), HTLV-I(MB), and HTLV-II(Mo)].

      In Europe, Borna disease virus (BDV) infection has been linked with staggering disease. The aim of this study was serological investigation for BDV infection in Australian cats. De-identified sera were obtained from domestic cats presented at various veterinary clinics. BDV antigen levels were measured by a monoclonal antibody-based ELISA. Antibody to BDV measured semiquantitatively by ELISA was detected in 0.8% of cats from South Australia and 3.2% of animals from NSW Confirmatory assays for ELISA positive samples included Western blot and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) with BDV-specific staining. Seven BDV-antigen positive sera (2.4%) were identified in sera from cats from New South Wales (NSW). In blinded testing, amongst a large number of negative results, repeat submissions over a seven-month period from a cat co-infected with Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) were BDV-antigen positive. Anti-BDV antibody detected in this cat by ELISA was confirmed by Western blot (p24/ p40/p56) and IFA. For 4 other anti-BDV ELISA-positive samples, specific reactions with BDV proteins were observed by Western blot. Ten other anti-BDV ELISA-positive samples were IFA positive. These data provide consistent serological evidence that, while horses in Australia are free of BDV infection, there may be a low rate of BDV infection in cats.

      Four populations of small wild British rodents were studied by capture--re-capture methods over a period of three years. Samples of blood were taken from these animals and tested for antibodies to nine viruses. Animals were removed from another 11 sites around the UK, and immunosuppressed. Samples of tissue from these animals were tested for the presence of viruses by passage in laboratory mice and serum samples from some of them were tested for antibody to the nine viruses. Indications were found of the possible influence of epizootic outbreaks of certain diseases on animal populations.

      Twenty free-ranging guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in Chubut Province, Argentina, were immobilized for health evaluations. All but two animals appeared to be in good condition. Hematology, serum chemistry, and vitamin and mineral levels were measured, and feces were evaluated for parasites. Serology tests included bluetongue, brucellosis, bovine respiratory syncitial virus, bovine viral diarrhea/mucosal disease, equine herpesvirus 1, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Johne's disease (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis), foot and mouth disease, leptospirosis (17 serovars), parainfluenza-3, and vesicular stomatitis. Blood samples from 20 domestic sheep (Ovis aries) maintained in the same reserve with the guanaco were also collected at the same time for serology tests. No guanaco had positive serologic tests. Sheep were found to have antibody titers to bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Johne's disease, leptospirosis, and parainfluenza-3. There was no apparent difference in external appearance or condition, or statistical difference in blood test values, between the animals that were positive or negative for parasite ova.

      A variety of hantaviruses are harbored by rodents in North and South America, some of which can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. To obtain greater evolutionary insight into hantaviruses in the Americas, a total of 211 rodents were captured in the Mexican states of Guerrero and Morelos in 2006. Anti-hantavirus antibodies were detected in 27 of 211 serum samples (12.8%) by ELISA. The distribution of seropositive rodents was: 17 Peromyscus beatae, 1 Megadontomys thomasi, 1 Neotoma picta, 6 Reithrodontomys sumichrasti, and 2 Reithrodontomys megalotis. The hantavirus small (S), medium (M), and large (L) genome segments from P. beatae, R. sumichrasti, and R. megalotis were amplified and the sequences covering the open reading frames were determined. The hantaviruses from P. beatae, R. sumichrasti, and R. megalotis were provisionally designated Montano (MTN), Carrizal (CAR), and Huitzilac (HUI), respectively. The M segment amino acid identities among the Mexican hantaviruses were 80.8-93.0%. When these M segments were compared to those of known hantaviruses, MTN virus was most closely related to Limestone Canyon (LSC) virus (88.9% amino acid identity), while the CAR and HUI viruses were most closely related to El Moro Canyon (ELMC) virus (90-91% identity). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the MTN, CAR, and HUI viruses occupy a monophyletic clade with the LSC, ELMC, and Rio Segundo viruses, which are harbored by Peromyscus boylii, R. megalotis, and Reithrodontomys mexicanus, respectively. The data obtained in this study provide important information for understanding the evolution of hantaviruses in the Americas.

      Small dermal tumors were found on three African hares (Lepus capensis) in the Laikipia District, Kenya. Gross and histopathologic studies revealed similarities to the Shope's fibroma of wild rabbits in North America and fibromas of European hares. Histological examination of the African hare fibromas revealed intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies characteristic of poxviruses and poxvirus virions were demonstrated by electron microscopy of ultrathin sections. Attempts to propagate the virus in rabbit skin, embryonated chicken eggs and cell cultures were unsuccessful.

      Our surveys indicate that nearly all batches of vervet monkeys arriving at the National Institute for Virology from various areas of South Africa, are infected with foamy viruses and there is evidence that intra-urterine infection also occurs. Monkeys from certain areas of South Africa are apparently infected with the protozoal parasite Entopolypoides macaci in a sub-clinical state which becomes active when the monkeys are splenectomised. Serological studies indicate that infections with schistosomes, tick-bite fever (Rickettsia conori), chlamydsiae and occasionally by leptospirae, occur in monkeys in the Kruger National Park. Complement fixation tests for antibodies to R. mooseri and R. prowazeki were also sometimes positive; a finding of doubtful importance. There was a high percentage with positive antibody tests to chikungunya virus in a certain age group suggesting that there had been an outbreak of this disease in the Kruger Park in the late summer and autumn of 1976. This coincided with a human outbreak. Large numbers of vervet and baboon sera were tested for antibodies against SA 12 virus, a polyoma virus. A high percentage of baboons but only a small number of monkeys was found to be positive and it is concluded that SA 12 is probably a baboon virus which is occasionally transmitted to monkeys by contact. It is pointed out that these studies only indicate diseases from which monkeys recover and they do not indicate prevalence of severe disease causing grave illness or death.

      Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences, related to the genomes of HPVs associated with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), were detected in DNA samples extracted from biopsied lesions in 2 of 24 cases of actinic keratosis found in the general population. An HPV DNA was molecularly cloned from one of these samples. Blot hybridization experiments, performed under stringent conditions, revealed a significant cross-hybridization only between this HPV DNA and the DNAs of HPV5 and of the HPV5-related types. The extent of homology between them ranged from 7 to 30%, as evaluated by hybridization in liquid phase at saturation followed by nuclease S1 analysis. This showed that the cloned HPV represented a new type, tentatively named HPV36. HPV36 was not found in the other 22 cases of actinic keratosis, but was detected in scrapings of benign lesions of 7 of 18 (39%) EV patients.

      Host feeding patterns of mosquitoes were assessed through the identification of 865 blood meals collected from Brisbane during 2000-2001. Under natural conditions, mosquito feeding (including that of Culex annulirostris, Aedes vigilax, and Aedes notoscriptus) was primarily on dogs (37.4%), but also on birds (18.4%), horses (16.8%), brushtail possums (13.3%), humans (11.6%), and cats, flying foxes, and macropods, depending on site. From 1997 to 1999, sera (N=1706) were collected from dogs, cats, horses, flying foxes, and brushtail possums in the Brisbane area and were analyzed by microneutralization assay for antibodies to Ross River virus (RRV) and Barmah Forest virus (BFV). For RRV, all vertebrate species tested had been naturally infected, and seroprevalence varied from 10.5% to 25.5%, whereas for BFV, rates varied between 0% and 11.3%. Brushtail possums were often infected in the field, with 17.6% and 10.7% of wild individuals having antibodies to RRV and BFV, respectively. Horses and flying foxes also had a relatively high prevalence of antibodies to RRV. This study, therefore, provides data to indicate that brushtail possums play a role in the urban transmission of RRV in Brisbane and that horses, when they occur, also fill the same role.

      Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the cause of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is a zoonotic infection of staggering proportions and social impact. Yet uncertainty persists regarding its natural reservoir. The virus most closely related to HIV-1 is a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) thus far identified only in captive members of the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes. Here we report the detection of SIVcpz antibodies and nucleic acids in fecal samples from wild-living P. t. troglodytes apes in southern Cameroon, where prevalence rates in some communities reached 29 to 35%. By sequence analysis of endemic SIVcpz strains, we could trace the origins of pandemic (group M) and nonpandemic (group N) HIV-1 to distinct, geographically isolated chimpanzee communities. These findings establish P. t. troglodytes as a natural reservoir of HIV-1.

      At least thirty-seven different viruses have been isolated from wild mammals in West Africa since 1962. Some of these, including Lassa virus, are already known to cause serious human morbidity and mortality. Crimean haemorrhagic fever-Congo virus, Dugbe virus, Mokola virus, and a smallpox-like agent from a gerbil in Dahomey are briefly discussed. An account of social and ecologic factors affecting man, domestic animals, and their interaction with wild mammals is given.

      Monoclonal antibody-based competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) has been used for the specific measurement of antibodies to peste des petits ruminants (PPR) viruses in sheep, goats, cattle and buffalo. Serum samples from sheep (n = 232), goats (n = 428), cattle (n = 43), buffalo (n = 89) were tested. The animals had not been vaccinated against rinderpest or PPR. Findings suggested that the sero-positive cases were significantly higher in sheep (51.29%) than in goats (39.02%) (P = 0.002). The overall sero-prevalence of PPRV in small ruminants was 43.33%. The PPR antibodies seroprevalence was 67.42% in buffalo and 41.86% in cattle which was significantly higher in buffalo (P = 0.005). The overall sero-prevalence of PPRV in large ruminants was 59.09%. Cattle and buffalo sera showed a high prevalence of antibody against PPR virus which may explain the difficulty experienced in achieving high post-vaccination immunity levels against rinderpest. Because antibodies against PPR virus are both cross-neutralizing and cross-protective against rinderpest virus, further vaccination in the presence of antibodies against PPR virus may be a waste of national resources. It was also suggested that antibodies to PPR virus could prevent an immune response to the rinderpest vaccine. This paper presents serological evidence for the transmission of PPR virus from sheep and goats to cattle and buffalo and highlights the need to include PPR serology in the sero-monitoring programme to give a better indication of national herd immunity of sheep and goats against PPR.

      When the research on the ecology of monkeypox virus entered the latest stage in 1984, three groups of animals were considered priority candidates for maintenance of virus circulations in nature because of their relatively higher population density: terrestrial rodents, squirrels, and gregarious bats. Following the isolation of the virus from a wild squirrel in 1985 another survey was carried out in Bumba zone of Zaïre in January-February 1986, which included collection of animal samples, later on tested by WHO collaborating laboratories. No antibodies were found in 233 rodents tested. A high prevalence of monkeypox-specific antibodies (24.7%) found in 320 squirrels of Funisciurus anerythrus species suggested that these animals sustain virus transmission in the areas surrounding human settlements. A consistently high level of antibody prevalence found among squirrels Heliosciurus rufobrachium suggested that this species is also steadily involved in the transmission. The squirrels, the only mammals frequently infected by monkeypox in the areas of human activities, which are frequently trapped by the population, are obviously a major source of infection for human beings. Out of 39 primates collected during the survey from the primary forest, three were found seropositive for monkeypox. At the moment, however, it is difficult to say whether the primates play an important role in sustaining virus transmission in nature, or (like human beings) that they are an occasional host of the virus. Possibilities are discussed of monkeypox virus transmission being sustained by squirrels outside the areas of major human activities.

      Baseline data on health of free-ranging wildlife is essential to evaluate impacts of habitat transformation and wildlife translocation, rehabilitation, and reintroduction programs. Health information on many species, especially great apes, is extremely limited. Between 1996 and 1998, 84 free-ranging orangutans captured for translocation, underwent a complete health evaluation. Analogous data were gathered from 60 semi-captive orangutans in Malaysia. Baseline hematology and serology; vitamin, mineral and pesticide levels; and results of health evaluations, including physical examination, provide a baseline for future monitoring. Free-ranging and semi-captive orangutans shared exposure to 11 of 47 viruses. The semi-captive orangutans had significantly higher prevalence of antibodies to adenovirus (P < 0.0005) and rota (SA 11) virus (P < 0.008). More free-ranging than semi-captive animals had antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus (P < 0.08) and foamy virus (P = 0.05). Exposure to parainfluenza and langat viruses was detected exclusively in semi-captive animals and exposure to sinbis virus was only found in free-ranging orangutans. There was evidence of exposure to respiratory syncytial virus, coxsackie virus, dengue virus, and zika virus in both groups. Ebstein-Barr virus was ubiquitous in both groups. Prevalence of antibodies against mumps virus changed from 0% in 1996 to 45% in 1998. No antibodies were detected to many important zoonotic viral pathogens, including herpesvirus and hepatitis virus. Prevalence of Balantidium coli and Plasmodium pitheci infections and exposure to mycobacterium was higher in the semi-captive animals. Differences in exposure to pathogens between the groups may be due to environmental factors including differences in exposures to other species, habitat quality, nutritional status, and other potential stressors. Differences in health parameters between captive and free-ranging orangutans need to be considered when planning conservation areas, translocation procedures, and rehabilitation protocols. Because survival of the orangutan is linked to animal and ecosystem health, results of this study will assist wildlife conservation programs by providing baseline health information.

      A multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed for the detection of and differentiation between porcine circovirus (PCV)-1 and PCV-2 in boar semen. Eighteen (30%) and 30 (50%) out of 60 whole semen samples were found to be positive for PCV using multiplex conventional PCR and multiplex nested PCR, respectively. Of the 30 positive samples obtained using multiplex nested PCR, two were found to be positive for PCV-1 only, eight for PCV-2 only, and 20 for PCV-1 and PCV-2. When the separated fractions of PCV-contaminated semen were analyzed using multiplex nested PCR, PCV DNA was found to be present mainly in the seminal fluid and nonsperm cell fractions. When compared with the virus isolation method commonly used to detect viruses, this PCR assay was found to be more sensitive and rapid and, as such, may prove to be a good alternative method for the detection of and differentiation between PCV-1 and PCV-2 in boar semen.

      Acute viral respiratory infections are among the most common causes of human disease. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is important for providing timely therapeutic interventions. This study evaluated a new multiplex PCR assay (Seegene Inc., Seoul, Korea) for simultaneous detection and identification of 12 respiratory viruses using two primer mixes. The viruses included parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus 229E/NL63 and OC43, adenovirus, influenza viruses A and B, human respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, and human rhinovirus A. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 10-100 copies per reaction for each type of virus. There was no cross-reactivity with common bacterial or viral pathogens. A comparison with conventional viral culture and immunofluorescence was carried out using 101 respiratory specimens from 92 patients. Using viral culture, 57 specimens (56.4%) were positive without co-infection. The same viruses were identified in all 57 specimens using the multiplex PCR. Seven of the 57 specimens (12.3%) were found to be co-infected with other respiratory viruses, and 19 of 44 (43.2%) specimens which were negative by culture were positive by the multiplex PCR. The Seeplex Respiratory Virus Detection assay represents a significant improvement over the conventional methods for the detection of a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses.

      The aquatic North American river otter (Lontra canadensis), a charismatic nonendangered mustelid, presently occupies a greatly reduced range. The species is common in zoos and has economic value as a furbearer. At least 17 states and one Canadian province have undertaken recent reintroduction programs. Nevertheless, little has been published on nonparasitic diseases of river otters, and little is known of the clinical significance of most of their parasitic infections. Records of environmental contaminant-related diseases and traumatic injuries in free-ranging North American river otters are also rare. This paper reviews present knowledge of North American river otter diseases, especially those with the greatest potential for impacting reintroduction programs.

      Serologic evidence of exposure to various disease agents in free-ranging and captive ungulates at a private game ranch in Kenya is presented, and seroprevalence values inside a fenced-in area are compared with those found on the adjacent open savanna. Zebras outside the fence had a higher prevalence of equine rhinovirus-1 than zebras inside (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.007); for all other species and all other agents, there was no such difference (P > 0.10). Results highlight possible transmission of these agents from domestic species into wildlife or vice versa at our study site.

      Aujeszky's disease virus was isolated from the brain of a horse which had shown severe neurological signs, including excessive sweating, muscle tremors and periods of mania. Pathological examination revealed a non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. The virus was propagated in cell culture and inoculated into the conjunctiva and nostrils of two ponies. The ponies developed fever seven days after inoculation and subsequently started to behave abnormally, showing severe neurological signs on the ninth day after inoculation. One pony became excited and the other was depressed. One pony died on the ninth day after inoculation and the other was euthanased on the 10th day. Both ponies had a significant increase in serum antibody titre against the virus. The virus was recovered from several parts of the brains and the eyes of the ponies. Aujeszky's disease in horses therefore fulfils Koch's postulates. Although horses do not appear to be very susceptible to the virus, Aujeszky's disease should be included in the differential diagnosis of horses with fatal or transient neurological signs of disease in areas where the virus is endemic.

      The antigenic and genetic characteristics of the 18 human strains of influenza C virus isolated in Yamagata and Sendai Cities, Japan between January 1991 and February 1993 were investigated. Antigenic analysis with monoclonal antibodies to the hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein showed that the isolates could be divided into three distinct groups closely related to C/Yamagata/26/81, C/Aichi/1/81 and C/Mississippi/80, respectively. T1-oligonucleotide fingerprinting of total vRNA revealed that the six isolates belonging to the C/Yamagata/26/81 virus group had the genomes greatly similar to one another but considerably different from those of the 1988/1990 isolates (except C/Yamagata/10/89) of the same antigenic group. Comparison of total or partial nucleotide sequences of the seven RNA segments of the three strains (C/Miyagi/3/91, C/Miyagi/9/91 and C/Miyagi/2/92) representative of the 1991/1993 strains of the C/Yamagata/26/81 virus group with those of the previous influenza C isolates obtained from humans and pigs during 1980/1989 showed that the 1991/1993 strains, like C/Yamagata/10/89, are more closely related to viruses isolated from pigs in Beijing, China in 1981/1982 than to any of the isolates from humans. This observation suggests strongly that interspecies transmission of influenza C virus between humans and pigs has occurred in nature, although it is not known whether the virus has been transmitted from pigs to humans or from humans to pigs.

      The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of mustelid herpesvirus-1 (MusHV-1) infection in free-ranging badgers (Meles meles) in the British Isles. A polymerase chain reaction assay was developed that detected MusHV-1 DNA in 95% (18/19) and 100% (10/10) of anticoagulant-treated blood samples collected from free-ranging badgers sampled in the southwest of England and the Republic of Ireland, respectively. An indirect immunoassay was also developed to detect MusHV-1-specific immunoglobulin-G in serum samples. Using an arbitrary cutoff of twice the optical density obtained with a virus-negative preparation, 32.7% (36/110) of sera sampled from badgers were positive. The conclusion drawn from these data is that infection with MusHV-1 is common among free-ranging badgers in the British Isles.

      Feline coronavirus (FCoV) is transmitted via the faecal-oral route and primarily infects enterocytes, but subsequently spreads by monocyte-associated viraemia. In some infected cats, virulent virus mutants induce feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal systemic disease that can develop in association with viraemia. Persistently infected, healthy carriers are believed to be important in the epidemiology of FIP, as they represent a constant source of FCoV, shed either persistently or intermittently in faeces. So far, the sites of virus persistence have not been determined definitely. The purpose of this study was to examine virus distribution and viral load in organs and gut compartments of specified-pathogen-free cats, orally infected with non-virulent type I FCoV, over different time periods and with or without detectable viraemia. The colon was identified as the major site of FCoV persistence and probable source for recurrent shedding, but the virus was shown also to persist in several other organs, mainly in tissue macrophages. These might represent additional sources for recurrent viraemia.

      O'nyong-nyong (ONN) fever, caused by infection with a mosquito-borne central African alphavirus, is an acute, nonfatal illness characterized by polyarthralgia. During 1996-1997, south-central Uganda experienced the second ONN fever epidemic ever recognized. Among 391 persons interviewed and sampled, 40 cases of confirmed and 21 of presumptive, well-characterized acute, recent, or previous ONN fever were identified through active case-finding efforts or during a household serosurvey and by the application of clinical and laboratory criteria. Among confirmed cases, the knees and ankles were the joints most commonly affected. The median duration of arthralgia was 6 days (range, 2-21 days) and of immobilization was 4 days (range, 1-14 days). In the majority, generalized skin rash was reported, and nearly half had lymphadenopathy, mainly of the cervical region. Viremia was documented in 16 cases, primarily during the first 3 days of illness, and in some of these, body temperature was normal. During this epidemic, the combination of fever, arthralgia, and lymphadenopathy had a specificity of 83% and a sensitivity of 61% in the identification of cases of ONN fever and thus could be useful for surveillance purposes.

      During cell culture isolation experiments to recover Dobrava hantavirus from a suspension of liver from a striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), an unknown virus was coisolated. Atypically for hantaviruses, it had extensive cytopathic effects. Using a random PCR approach, it was identified as a novel murine adenovirus, MAdV-3 (for MAdV type 3). A plaque-purified virus clone was prepared and further characterized. The complete genome sequence of MAdV-3 was determined to be 30,570 bp in length. Sequence comparisons to other adenovirus species revealed highest similarity to MAdV-1, the representative of the murine adenovirus A species. However, substantial differences were found in the E1, E3, and E4 genomic regions. The phylogenetic distance of MAdV-3 amino acid sequences for pVIII, protease, polymerase, and hexon from MAdV-1 is markedly higher than 0.1 exchange per position, and, based on our cross-neutralization experiments, MAdV-3 and MAdV-1 can be regarded as different serotypes. Therefore, we propose to classify MAdV-3 as the first isolate of a novel adenovirus species, designated murine adenovirus C (MAdV-C). The novel MAdV-3 virus is not only genetically and serologically distinct from MAdV-1 but also shows a unique organ tropism in infected mice. In contrast to MAdV-1, the virus was not detectable in brain but predominantly infected heart tissue. Thus, infection of mice with cardiotropic MAdV-3 might be an interesting animal model of adenovirus-induced myocarditis.

      Volepox virus (VPX) from skin lesions on a vole and a piñon mouse caught in California and raccoon poxvirus (RCN) from raccoons trapped in Maryland were examined to begin elucidating their relationship to other orthopoxviruses, most of which are not known to be indigenous to the Americas. VPX and RCN produced pinpoint, nonhemorrhagic pocks on chick embryo chorioallantoic membranes. In cell cultures both viruses produced 1-mm diameter, irregular plaques, A-type inclusions (ATIs), and despite production of hemagglutinin, both viruses caused syncytia formation. Considerable cross-hybridization was seen between VPX and RCN DNA and the DNAs of other orthopoxviruses; however, HindIII cleavage site maps showed marked central and terminal region differences between VPX (222.8 kbp) and RCN (224.8 kbp) DNA and mapped DNAs of other orthopoxviruses. Cognate DNAs of the ATI 160-kDa protein and 38-kDa serine protease inhibitor homologue of cowpox virus (CPV) and the 14-kDa fusion protein of vaccinia virus (VAC) were present within the right end of VPX and RCN DNA, matching their location in CPV and VAC. VPX and RCN, respectively, expressed a 150- and a 155-kDa ATI major protein and a 20- and an 18-kDa fusion protein. Low stringency annealing suggested that cognate DNAs for the VAC growth factor and the alpha-amanitin target protein were present within the left end of VPX and RCN DNA, matching their location in VAC. Terminal tandem repeat sequences of VAC and RCN did not cross-hybridize with each other or with VPX DNA end fragments. Together, the data suggested that VPX and RCN are phylogenetically rather distant from orthopoxviruses not indigenous to the Americas, although genetic information is arranged as in other examined orthopoxviruses.

      Partial nucleotide sequences of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) viruses isolated from five, apparently independent, outbreaks of fatal myocarditis in pigs in Italy were compared with three EMC viruses isolated from wild rodents from a different geographic region in the same country. These viruses were also compared with EMC viruses isolated from pigs in other European countries and three historical strains. All the Italian EMC viruses were closely related (> 94.6% nucleotide identity), but were distinct from viruses occurring in Belgium in 1991 (< 80.5% nucleotide identity), Greece in 1990 (< 83.3% nucleotide identity) and the three older viruses (< 82.9% nucleotide identity). An EMC virus isolated from pigs in the Netherlands in 1988, was closely related to the Italian viruses (95.3-99.3% nucleotide identity). It is suggested that pigs may play a role in the movement of EMC viruses between different geographic regions.

      Thirty-three Brazilian bat rabies viruses (RVs) were studied by sequence analysis and were compared against sequences of bat-related RVs from other regions of the Americas. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that bat-related RVs formed several monophyletic lineages and that these were associated with bat species. Brazilian bat RVs were found to include nine major lineages, one of which grouped with RVs isolated from Lasiurus spp. from different regions of the Americas. These results suggest that there is considerable diversity among Brazilian bat RV variants and that some of these RV variants may be associated with bats from other countries.

      A molecular epidemiological analysis was performed in 19 rabies viruses (RVs) isolated from haematophagous, frugivorous and insectivorous bats, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The authors carried out RT-PCR for amplification of the RV nucleoprotein (N) gene, and determined 1,335 nucleotide sequences of N gene by direct sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis, which was based on the N gene of Brazilian RV isolates identified presently and previously, revealed that RVs isolated from bats were genetically divided into four lineages had a tendency to depend on the host bat species. The first lineage consisted mainly of haematophagous bat (Desmodus rotundus) isolates, including frugivorous bat (Artibeus spp.) isolates. Other three lineages consisted of insectivorous bat isolates; mainly Eptesicus spp., Molossus spp. and Nyctinomops spp. isolates, respectively. These results indicate a possibility of that there are bat species-specific RV variants in Brazil.

      The low rates of nonsynonymous evolution observed in natural rabies virus (RABV) isolates are suggested to have arisen in association with the structural and functional constraints operating on the virus protein and the infection strategies employed by RABV within infected hosts to avoid strong selection by the immune response. In order to investigate the relationship between the genetic characteristics of RABV populations within hosts and the virus evolution, the present study examined the genetic heterogeneities of RABV populations within naturally infected dogs and foxes in Brazil, as well as those of bat RABV populations that were passaged once in suckling mice. Sequence analyses of complete RABV glycoprotein (G) genes showed that RABV populations within infected hosts were genetically highly homogeneous whether they were infected naturally or experimentally (nucleotide diversities of 0-0.95x10(-3)). In addition, amino acid mutations were randomly distributed over the entire region of the G protein, and the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratios (d(N)/d(S)) for the G protein gene were less than 1. These findings suggest that the low genetic diversities of RABV populations within hosts reflect the stabilizing selection operating on the virus, the infection strategies of the virus, and eventually, the evolutionary patterns of the virus.

      To diagnose respiratory disease among wild great apes, there is a need for noninvasive diagnostic methods. Therefore, we analyzed fecal samples from habituated chimpanzees from Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. Samples had been collected during four distinct outbreaks: two with known aetiology (March 2004 and February 2006) and two with unknown aetiology (October 2004 and August 2005). Fecal samples were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), two paramyxoviruses previously found in lung tissue of chimpanzees that died due to respiratory disease. In the March 2004 outbreak, 72% of the tested individuals were positive for HMPV, and during the 2006 epidemic, 25% tested HRSV-positive. In the outbreaks where no causative pathogen was previously known, fecal samples tested positive for either HRSV or HMPV, showing that reinfection occurred. Virus sequences were generated and compared with sequences previously found in tissue; nearly identical virus sequences in both tissue and fecal samples were found. These results demonstrate that fecal samples collected during outbreak times can be used for the diagnostic and phylogenetic analysis of HMPV and HRSV. Using such diagnostic tools, systematic noninvasive disease investigation of respiratory outbreaks in wild great apes becomes possible. The methods presented here may also be applied for the investigation of further acute diseases in great apes and other species.

      A great body of data on the fauna and ecology of wild mammals and their participation in the circulation of arboviruses were collected when the ecology of the latter of the Republic of Guinea was studied in 1978 to 1989. A hundred and eighteen species belonging to 10 orders were identified. Over 2,000 biological specimens were virologically and serologically examined. Six arboviruses were isolated. These included Dugbe virus (from the hussar monkey Cercopithecus (Erythrocebus patas) and 5 viruses from chiropters: Rift valley fever, from Micropteropus pusillus, Miniopterus schreibersi, and Hipposideros caffer, Saboya, Fomede, and Ank 6909 from Nycteris gambiensis and Kolenter from Hipposideros sp. Fomede, Kolente, and Ank 6909 viruses turned out to be new species for science. Rodents were found to have viral antigens of Lass fever (Mastomys natalensis, Tatera valida kempi and Rattus rattus), Dugbe and Chikungunya fevers (M. natalensis) and West Nile fever (Mus sp.). A serological survey of mammals revealed that the latter had antibodies to 12 arboviruses. Thus, the mammals of Guinea participate in the circulation of 18 arboviruses, 13 of them are pathogenic for man.

      Different Microtus species, present in a worldwide range habitat populating North America, Europe, Asia, and few other species have been recognized previously as a hantavirus reservoir. Tula hantavirus was first reported in Microtus arvalis and Microtus rossiaemeridionalis from Central Russia and later discovered in several European countries. Using molecular techniques we have demonstrated the presence of Tula hantavirus in three different Microtus species in Slovenia. Phylogenetic analyses of partial S segment placed Slovenian strains in the same genetic lineage as Austrian and Croatian strains.

      Two panels of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the classical swine fever virus (CSFV) envelope glycoproteins E2 (12 mAbs) and E0 (11 mAbs) were established and tested by immunoperoxidase binding assay against 135 pestivirus strains and isolates. Variability of the binding pattern was demonstrated for CSFV and also for bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strains and isolates. The panels of mAbs against E2 and E0 led to very different reactivity patterns. Particular mAbs against E2 reacted with (i) all CSFV isolates, (ii) only 4 out of 126 CSFV isolates, or (iii) about 90% of the tested CSFV isolates and 78% of ruminant pestivirus isolates. Anti CSFV E0 mAbs allowed the detection of a greater variability among the CSFV strains and isolates than the anti E2 mAbs. None of the 11 anti E0 mAbs recognized an epitope conserved for CSFV or showed crossreactivity with ruminant pestiviruses. The use of both panels of mAbs against two CSFV structural glycoproteins led to the discrimination of 21 antigenic types of CSFV strains and isolates. The described panels can be used to trace the origin of CSFV after outbreaks of the disease.

      The objectives of this study were to extend our knowledge of the geographic distribution and rodent host range of arenaviruses in North America. Sera from wild rodents collected from the southern and western United States were tested for antibody against Tamiami, Pichinde, Junin, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis viruses, using an indirect fluorescent antibody test. Antibody to at least one arenavirus was found in 220 (3.1%) of 7,106 rodents tested. The antibody-positive animals included Mus musculus from Florida and Texas; Neotoma albigula from Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; N. fuscipes and N. lepida from California: N. mexicana from Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah; N. stephensi from Arizona and New Mexico; and Oryzomys palustris and Sigmodon hispidus from Florida. Sigmodon hispidus seropositive for Tamiami virus were found only in Florida (156 [27.0%] of 578 tested), although 463 hispid cotton rats from outside that state were examined. High-titered antibodies to Tamiami virus were present in sera from S. hispidus, (geometric mean antibody titer [GMAT] of 1:792), whereas sera from Neotoma spp. reacted at high titer to both Tamiami (GMAT = 1:905) and Pichinde (GMAT = 1:433) viruses. The results suggest that arenaviruses are widely distributed in the southern United States and that one or more indigenous arenaviruses are associated with Neotoma spp. in North America.

      Simian adenovirus 3 (SAdV-3) is one of several adenoviruses that were isolated decades ago from Old World monkeys. Determination of the complete DNA sequence of SAdV-3 permitted the first full genomic comparison of a monkey adenovirus with adenoviruses of humans (HAdVs) and chimpanzees, which are recognized formally as constituting six of the species (HAdV-A to HAdV-F) within the genus Mastadenovirus. The SAdV-3 genome is 34 246 bp in size and has a G+C content of 55.3 mol%. It contains all the genes that are characteristic of the genus Mastadenovirus and has a single VA-RNA gene and six genes in each of the E3 and E4 regions. The genetic organization is the same as that of HAdV-12, a member of the HAdV-A species. Phylogenetic analyses showed that although SAdV-3 is related marginally more closely to HAdV-A and HAdV-F than to other species, it represents a unique lineage that branched at an early stage of primate adenovirus divergence. The results imply that the genetic layout in SAdV-3 and HAdV-12 may also have characterized the common ancestor of all sequenced primate adenoviruses.

      A total of 2922 small terrestrial mammals of 12 species were collected in six localities of West Slovakia between 1981 and 1986. When examined for the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NA) to Central European encephalitis (CEE) virus we found that 14.6% had antibody. Nearly all (97%) of the 426 animals with antibody were Clethrionomys glareolus, the most abundant species (52.6% of mammals collected, 15.1% of those with antibody). Apodemus flavicollis (22.5% of mammals collected, 18.1% of those with antibody), Apodemus sylvaticus (14% of mammals collected, 8.5% of those with antibody), and Microtus arvalis (5.5% of mammals collected, 3.3% of those with antibody). In all locations studies the most abundant tick found on small mammals was Ixodes ricinus (larvae and nymphs). Less abundant, but present in all studied sites, were larvae and nymphs of Dermacentor reticulatus and Haemaphysalis concinna. Six strains of CEE virus were isolated from tissues of animals: four from Clethryonomys glareolus and one each from Apodemus flavicollis and Sorex araneus. Three of six isolates were from animals collected in February; none of the six had detectable neutralizing antibody to CEE virus. We discuss these observations with regard to possible mechanisms of persistence of CEE virus.

      The complete nucleotide sequences of the envelope gene of 62 geographic isolates of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequences, conducted using both maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, included four other members of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup. The results indicated that the SLE isolates formed a monophyletic group in which isolates generally clustered according to geographic origin. Isolates from Panama and South America predominantly formed two large groupings, while isolates from the U.S. formed two other major groups. Several South and Central American strains were more closely related to strains isolated in the U.S., e.g., one isolate from Mexico and Panama, each, were closely related to two Tampa Bay, Florida, isolates, and an isolate, from Brazil was closely related to three isolates from Texas. The U.S. isolates also were not strictly grouped according to geographic source, e.g., some California isolates were closely related to Texas or midwestern isolates, and a Florida isolate was closely related to three isolates from Maryland. The results of the phylogenetic analyses indicated that SLE virus is predominantly maintained locally, but has been transported occasionally between areas, both within and outside the U.S.

      The DNAs of four human papillomaviruses (HPVs) that were found in the benign lesions of three patients suffering from epidermodysplasia verruciformis have been characterized. The flat wart-like lesions and the macular lesions of patient 1 contained two viruses, HPV-3a and HPV-8, respectively, whose genomes had previously been only partially characterized. The flat wart-like lesions of patient 2 and the macular lesions of patient 3 each contained a virus previously considered as belonging to types 3 and 5, respectively. These viruses are shown in the present study to be different from all of the HPV types so far characterized; they have tentatively been named HPV-10 and HPV-12. The HPV-3a, HPV-8, and HPV-12 DNAs and the two SalI fragments of HPV-10 DNA (94.1 and 5.9% of the genome length) were cloned in Escherichia coli after having been inserted in plasmid pBR322. The cloned HPV genomes have similar sizes (about 7,700 base pairs), but their guanine-plus-cytosine contents differ from 41.8% for HPV-12 DNA to 45.5% for HPV-3a DNA. The study of the sensitivity of the four HPV DNAs to 14 restriction endonucleases permitted the construction of cleavage maps. Evidence for conserved restriction sites was found only for the HPV-3a and HPV-10 genomes since 5 of the 21 restriction sites localized in the HPV-3a DNA seem to be present also in the HPV-10 DNA. Hybridization experiments, performed in liquid phase at saturation, showed a 35% sequence homology between HPV-3a and HPV-10 DNAs, 17 to 29% sequence homology among HPV-5, HPV-8, and HPV-12 DNAs, almost no sequence homology between the HPV-3a or HPV-10 DNA and the other HPV DNAs, and a weak homology between HPV-9 DNA and HPV-8 or HPV-12 DNA. Blot hybridization experiments showed no sequence homology between the HPV-3a, HPV-8, and HPV-12 DNAs and the DNAs of the HPVs associated with skin warts (HPV-1a, HPV-2, HPV-4, and HPV-7) or with mucocutaneous and mucous membrane lesions (HPV-6b and HPV-11a, respectively). One exception was a weak sequence homology between the HPV-2 prototype and HPV-3a or HPV-10 DNA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

      A porcine torovirus (PoTV) was identified and characterized; it is a novel member of the genus Torovirus (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales), closely related to but clearly distinct from the already recognized equine torovirus (ETV) and bovine torovirus (BoTV) representatives. Immunoelectron microscopy of feces from piglets revealed elongated, 120- by 55-nm particles which were recognized by a torovirus-specific antiserum. Amplification by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR with primers designed to detect conserved regions (on the basis of the genomes of BoTV strain Breda and ETV strain Berne) resulted in the identification of the 489-bp nucleocapsid gene, encoding a 18.7-kDa protein. The sequence identity in this region between PoTV and both ETV and BoTV was only about 68%, whereas the latter two show 81% identity. Neutralizing antibodies directed against ETV were found in sera of adult and young pigs. In all 10 herds sampled, seropositive animals were present, and 81% of randomly selected adult sows possessed antibodies. A longitudinal study with RT PCR showed that piglets shed virus in the feces for 1 or more days, starting 4 to 14 days after weaning.

      Bayou hantavirus, previously implicated in human hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Louisiana, was isolated from a rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) captured in Georgia. The presence of antibody among rice rats captured throughout the southeastern United States and the extent of diversity among the genetic variants of Bayou viruses suggest that the rice rat is the most likely natural reservoir of the virus and that both virus and host have probably co-evolved for some years.

      We determined the prevalence of Sin Nombre virus antibodies in small mammals in southeastern Arizona. Of 1,234 rodents (from 13 species) captured each month from May through December 1995, only mice in the genus Peromyscus were seropositive. Antibody prevalence was 14.3% in 21 white-footed mice (P. leucopus), 13.3% in 98 brush mice (P. boylii), 0.8% in 118 cactus mice (P. eremicus), and 0% in 2 deer mice (P. maniculatus). Most antibody-positive mice were adult male Peromyscus captured close to one another early in the study. Population dynamics of brush mice suggest a correlation between population size and hantavirus-antibody prevalence.

      A human papillomavirus (HPV) was cloned from a patient with multiple squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and identified as HPV88, recently categorized into a new species within the genus Gamma. The HPV88 viral load in an SCC of the index patient exceeded 1 million copies/cell. By contrast, a survey of 447 skin lesions (79 actinic keratoses, 73 seborrhoeic keratoses, 169 basal cell carcinomas and 126 SCCs) and 362 healthy skin biopsies found detectable HPV88 DNA in only 7 specimens. All these had very low viral loads (<1 copy/10(3) cells) implying extreme biological variability in viral load.

      Fifty-five rabies virus isolates originating from different regions of the former Soviet Union (FSU) were compared with isolates originating from Eurasia, Africa, and North America according to complete or partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences. The FSU isolates formed five distinct groups. Group A represented viruses originating from the Arctic, which were similar to viruses from Alaska and Canada. Group B consisted of ""Arctic-like"" viruses, originating from the south of East Siberia and the Far East. Group C consisted of viruses circulating in the steppe and forest-steppe territories from the European part of Russia to Tuva and in Kazakhstan. These three phylogenetic groups were clearly different from the European cluster. Viruses of group D circulate near the western border of Russia. Their phylogenetic position is intermediate between group C and the European cluster. Group E consisted of viruses originating from the northwestern part of Russia and comprised a ""northeastern Europe"" group described earlier from the Baltic region. According to surveillance data, a specific host can be defined clearly only for group A (arctic fox; Alopex lagopus) and for the Far Eastern part of the group B distribution area (raccoon dog; Nyctereutes procyonoides). For other territories and rabies virus variants, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) is the main virus reservoir. However, the steppe fox (Vulpes corsac), wolf (Canis lupus), and raccoon dog are also involved in virus circulation, depending on host population density. These molecular data, joined with surveillance information, demonstrate that the current fox rabies epizootic in the territory of the FSU developed independently of central and western Europe. No evidence of positive selection was found in the N genes of the isolates. In the glycoprotein gene, evidence of positive selection was strongly suggested in codons 156, 160, and 183. At these sites, no link between amino acid substitutions and phylogenetic placement or specific host species was detected.

      Lyssavirus surveillance in bats was performed in Bangladesh during 2003 and 2004. No virus isolates were obtained. Three serum samples (all from Pteropus giganteus, n = 127) of 288 total serum samples, obtained from bats in 9 different taxa, neutralized lyssaviruses Aravan and Khujand. The infection occurs in bats in Bangladesh, but virus prevalence appears low.

      Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious disease of small ruminants. The causal agent, PPR virus (PPRV), is classified into four genetically distinct lineages. Lineage IV, originally from Asia, has shown a unique capacity to spread across Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Recent studies have reported its presence in two West African countries: Nigeria and Niger. Animals are frequently exchanged between Mali and Niger, which could allow the virus to enter and progress in Mali and to other West African countries. Here, PPRV samples were collected from sick goats between 2014 and 2017 in both Mali and in Senegal, on the border with Mali. Partial PPRV nucleoprotein gene was sequenced to identify the genetic lineage of the strains. Our results showed that lineage IV was present in south-eastern Mali in 2017. This is currently the furthest West the lineage has been detected in West Africa. Surprisingly, we identified the persistence at least until 2014 of the supposedly extinct lineage I in two regions of Mali, Segou and Sikasso. Most PPRV sequences obtained in this study belonged to lineage II, which is dominant in West Africa. Phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship between sequences obtained at the border between Senegal and Mali, supporting the hypothesis of an important movement of the virus between the two countries. Understanding the movement of animals between these countries, where the livestock trade is not fully controlled, is very important in the design of efficient control strategies to combat this devastating disease.

      Isolation of 47 strains of Tamdy virus (Bunyaviridae) in the Uzbek SSR, Turkmen SSR, Armenian SSR, Kazakh SSR, and Kirghiz SSR was analysed. Thirty-two strains were isolated from Hyalomma asiaticum ticks in which transovarial transmission of the virus was demonstrated. Three subspecies of H. asiaticum are associated with semi-desert and desert landscapes of the Asian continent. The association of Tamdy virus with hosts of various stages of metamorphosis of the ticks, in particular, with cattle and great gerbils is discussed.

      Wild rodents (n = 330) were trapped around the villages of Altindere and Coşandere (Maçka, Trabzon Province), Ayder, Ortan, and Yolkiyi (Camlihemşin, Rize Province), and Bozdag (Odemiş, Izmir Province) in northeastern and western Turkey during April 2004. Samples were tested for arenavirus, hantavirus, and cowpox virus (family Poxviridae, genus Orthopoxvirus, CPXV) antibodies by using immunofluorescence assays (IFAs). Antibodies against arenaviruses were found in eight of 330 (2.4%) rodents. Arenavirus sero-positive animals were found from all study sites. Antibodies to Puumala virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus, PUUV) were detected in four of 65 Microtus voles tested. Of the PUUV-IFA-positive voles, one Microtus guentheri lydius was caught from Izmir, and one Microtus roberti and two Microtus rossiaemeridionalis were captured near Trabzon. All 264 Apodemus spp. mice tested negative for antibodies to Saaremaa virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus, SAAV); the single Dryomys nitedula tested negative for both PUUV and SAAV antibodies. Only one (0.3%) of the rodents, an Apodemus sylvaticus from Trabzon area, tested seropositive to CPXV. This is the first serologic survey for rodent-borne viruses in their natural hosts in Turkey. Although these preliminary results support presence of several virus groups with zoonotic potential, additional studies are needed to identify the specific viruses that are present in these populations.

      Antibody to Ebola virus was found in 14 (1.2%) of 1147 human sera collected in Gabon in 1981-1997. Six seropositive subjects were bled in the northeast in 1991, more than 3 years prior to recognition of the first known outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF), whilst eight came from the southwest where the disease has not been recognised. It has been reported elsewhere that 98 carcasses of wild animals were found in systematic studies in northeastern Gabon and adjoining northwestern Republic of the Congo (RoC) during five EHF epidemics in August 2001 to June 2003, with Ebola virus infection being confirmed in 14 carcasses. During the present opportunistic observations, reports were investigated of a further 397 carcasses, mainly gorillas, chimpanzees, mandrills and bush pigs, found by rural residents in 35 incidents in Gabon and RoC during 1994-2003. Sixteen incidents had temporal and/or spatial coincidence with confirmed EHF outbreaks, and the remaining 19 appeared to represent extension of disease from such sites. There appeared to be sustained Ebola virus activity in the northeast in 1994-1999, with sequential spread from 1996 onwards, first westwards, then southerly, and then northeastwards, reaching the Gabon-RoC border in 2001. This implies that there was transmission of infection between wild mammals, but the species involved are highly susceptible and unlikely to be natural hosts of the virus.

      A quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay for the detection of Colorado Tick Fever (CTF) viral RNA in human clinical samples is presented. The sensitivity of this assay has been shown to be greater than that of the isolation of virus in Vero cells by standard plaque assay in a direct comparison. The specificity of the CTF quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was determined by the exclusive detection of CTF viral RNAs when applied to a diverse panel of CTF viral isolates and reference strain agents known to circulate in areas of CTF virus transmission. Lastly, the quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay demonstrated exceptional sensitivity for the detection of CTF viral RNA in acute human serum. The quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay is efficient, sensitive and specific and as such is useful for the detection of CTF viral RNA in the diagnostic or research laboratory.

      The genus Capripoxvirus (CaPV) comprises three members namely, sheep poxvirus (SPPV), goat poxvirus (GTPV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) affecting sheep, goats and cattle, respectively. CaPV infections produce similar symptoms in sheep and goats, and the three viruses cannot be distinguished serologically. Since there are conflicting opinions regarding the host specificity of CaPVs, particularly for goatpox and sheeppox viruses, the development of rapid genotyping tools will facilitate more accurate disease diagnosis and surveillance for better management of capripox outbreaks. This paper describes a species-specific, real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), based on unique molecular markers that were found in the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor (GPCR) gene sequences of CaPVs, that uses dual hybridization probes for their simultaneous detection, quantitation and genotyping. The assay can differentiate between CaPV strains based on differences in the melting point temperature (Tm) obtained after fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA). It is highly sensitive and presents low intra- and inter-run variation. This real time PCR assay will make a significant contribution to CaPV diagnosis and to the better understanding of the epidemiology of CaPVs by enabling rapid genotyping and gene-based classification of viral strains and unequivocal identification of isolates.

      A virus very similar or identical to Colorado tick fever (CTF) virus was recovered from the blood clot of one of 104 black-tailed jack rabbits (Lepus californicus) examined during a survey for various zoonotic agents in mammals and ticks from the University of California, Hopland Field Station, Mendocino County, California, 1974--79. This is the first reported isolation of a CTF-like virus from L. californicus, and only the second time such a virus has been found in northwestern California. Mendocino County is located far outside the known distributional ranges of the most common mammalian hosts of CTF virus and of Dermacentor andersoni, the only proven tick vector for man. The viral isolate is very similar to a CTF-like virus previously recovered from the blood and spleen of a western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) from San Luis Obispo County, an area also outside of the previously-known CTF area. Virus was not isolated from 14 additional species of mammals (354 specimens) or from eight species of ticks (4,487 individuals), but CTF-neutralizing antibodies were detected in 28 of 771 (3.6%) sera from seven of 15 mammalian species including significant titers (greater than or equal to 1:8) in two species and one subspecies not previously reported as natural hosts, i.e., brush mouse (Peromyscus boylii), pinyon mouse (P. truei), and Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus). CTF indirect immunofluorescent antibodies also were detected in 26 of 129 (20.2%) sera belonging to four of five mammalian species tested. Neutralizing antibodies were found in sera of deer from other localities in Mendocino County, from a deer mouse from Napa County, and from a brush rabbit from Monterey County as well. These findings suggest that a virus identical or similar to CTF virus is widespread in northwestern-westcentral California, and that surveillance for human cases of CTF or a similar disease should be extended to cover this region.

      Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) is an arterivirus that causes severe disease in captive macaques. We describe two new SHFV variants subclinically infecting wild African red-tailed guenons (Cercopithecus ascanius). Both variants are highly divergent from the prototype virus and variants infecting sympatric red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus). All known SHFV variants are monophyletic and share three open reading frames not present in other arteriviruses. Our data suggest a need to modify the current arterivirus classification.

      Sets of primers were designed which enabled specific amplification of homologous regions of the glycoprotein C and gene 76 genetic loci of equine herpesviruses 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4). The resultant virus-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products arising from each loci could be discriminated easily on the basis of size on an agarose gel, allowing rapid differentiation of the two equine herpesviruses. Specificity of the amplifications were confirmed by Southern hybridization and restriction endonuclease digestion. The PCR test was applied to nasal swab samples from weanling foals and to archival aborted fetal tissue samples and the results compared to those obtained by virus isolation. A strong correlation was found between this PCR assay and virus isolation methods of EHV-1 and EHV-4 detection and discrimination.

      We have isolated a new strain of Ebola virus from a non-fatal human case infected during the autopsy of a wild chimpanzee in the Côte-d'Ivoire. The wild troop to which this animal belonged has been decimated by outbreaks of haemorrhagic syndromes. This is the first time that a human infection has been connected to naturally-infected monkeys in Africa. Data from the long-term survey of this troop of chimpanzees could answer questions about the natural reservoir of the Ebola virus.

      TT virus is a newly described agent infecting humans. Initially isolated from a patient (initials T.T.) with unexplained hepatitis, the virus has since been found in both normal and diseased individuals. In the present study, we utilized genomic-length sequences from distinct genotypes of TT virus to design PCR-based assays using conserved oligonucleotide primers from three independent regions of the virus genome. Each of the three assays was found to be superior to the PCR-based assays previously published. The most sensitive of the new assays was utilized to demonstrate the prevalence of TT virus to be at least 34.1% in volunteer blood donors, 39.6% in commercial blood donors, 59.6% in non-A-GB hepatitis cases, 81.7% in injectable drug users and 95.9% in haemophiliacs. In an attempt to identify a possible source of human infection, we found TT virus sequences to be present in 19% of chickens, 20% of pigs, 25% of cows and 30% of sheep. Sequence determination and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that isolates from farm animals were not genetically distinct from those found in humans. This study clearly demonstrates that previously reported PCR assays dramatically underestimate the true prevalence of TT virus within the human population. Due to the high rate of infection in both blood donors and those with non-A-GB hepatitis, these results question the causal role of TT virus in cases of unexplained hepatitis. Further, it is possible that domesticated farm animals serve as a source of human infection.

      To clarify the presence of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in Spain, we examined blood and tissue specimens from 866 small mammals. LCMV RNA was detected in 3 of 694 wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the strains constitute a new evolutionary lineage. LCMV antibodies were detected in 4 of 10 rodent species tested.

      Knowledge of infection reservoir dynamics is critical for effective disease control, but identifying reservoirs of multi-host pathogens is challenging. Here, we synthesize several lines of evidence to investigate rabies reservoirs in complex carnivore communities of the Serengeti ecological region in northwest Tanzania, where the disease has been confirmed in 12 carnivore species.Long-term monitoring data suggest that rabies persists in high-density domestic dog Canis familiaris populations (> 11 dogs km(-2)) and occurs less frequently in lower-density (< 5 dogs km(-2)) populations and only sporadically in wild carnivores.Genetic data show that a single rabies virus variant belonging to the group of southern Africa canid-associated viruses (Africa 1b) circulates among a range of species, with no evidence of species-specific virus-host associations.Within-species transmission was more frequently inferred from high-resolution epidemiological data than between-species transmission. Incidence patterns indicate that spill-over of rabies from domestic dog populations sometimes initiates short-lived chains of transmission in other carnivores.Synthesis and applications. The balance of evidence suggests that the reservoir of rabies in the Serengeti ecosystem is a complex multi-host community where domestic dogs are the only population essential for persistence, although other carnivores contribute to the reservoir as non-maintenance populations. Control programmes that target domestic dog populations should therefore have the greatest impact on reducing the risk of infection in all other species including humans, livestock and endangered wildlife populations, but transmission in other species may increase the level of vaccination coverage in domestic dog populations necessary to eliminate rabies.

      The presence of antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in 60% of procured owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus) held within the United States prompted a study of recently captured A trivirgatus in Panama. Only 2 of 145 newly captured monkeys, but all of 35 A trivirgatus held within a colony for over 100 days, were found to have anti-HAV. Of 41 sero-negative, newly captured monkeys followed prospectively, 25 became infected with hepatitis A virus (HAV) as evidenced by seroconversion or demonstration of virus in the liver at death. Only one monkey that survived over 60 days within the colony was not infected. HAV was identified in the feces of most infected monkeys prior to the development of antibody and was antigenically indistinguishable from human HAV in cross-blocking radioimmunoassays. This colony-centered epizootic provides strong evidence that A trivirgatus is susceptible to HAV and should be investigated further as a potential model of human hepatitis A.

      This study focused on finding, culturing, and identifying the biological and genetic characteristics of three louping ill virus (LIV) strains in the south of the Russian Far East. The Primorye-155-77 and Primorye-20-79 virus strains were isolated from Ixodes persulcatus ticks, and the Primorye-185-91 strain was isolated from the blood of a person after a tick bite. According to the hemagglutination and neutralization tests, Primorye-155-77, Primorye-20-79 and Primorye-185-91 had weak reactivity with antibodies in an antiserum against tick-borne encephalitis virus. In Primorye-155-77 and Primorye-20-79, the sequences of the 5' ends of the 2456-nucleotide-long viral RNA including the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and genes of the capsid protein, prM protein and envelope E protein were determined. The complete genome sequence of Primorye-185-91 was determined. The E protein gene of the Negishi strain differed from those of three analyzed strains, as there were mutations resulting in the replacement of three amino acids: Ala163Thr, Asp193Asn and Ala313Thr. The homology of Primorye-185-91 to LIV 369/T2 was 97.57 %, and to the Penrith strain, it was 98.36 %. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Primorye-155-77, Primorye-20-79 and Primorye-185-91 are related to LI/A and LI/K strains isolated in England and Scotland and to the Negishi strain; these strains have a common progenitor. Negishi-like strains were represented by one subtype of louping ill virus, i.e. the British subtype (LIV-Brit). The possibility is discussed of a single introduction of the virus to the Far Eastern region (Japan and Primorsky Krai) from a single natural locus more than 50 years ago.

      Lentiviruses from distinct animal species have in common their genomic organization, the induction of slowly progressive diseases over months or years, the large spectrum of induced symptoms and concerned organs, the frequent inapparent infection without any detectable clinical signs, their ability to persist into their hosts despite an often strong and mature immune response. Lentiviruses are also characterized by their genomic plasticity and the rapid evolution of the viral species. SRLVs infecting goats and sheep follow a genomic evolution pattern similar to that observed in HIV or in other lentiviruses. Based on limited number of complete sequences, they have been initially described as two distinct genetic groups evolving independently in sheep or goats, the ovine strains being closely related to each other and distinct from the caprine ones. Over the last 2 decades, the description of many partial or complete sequences of caprine and ovine field isolates from various geographical regions and their phylogenetic studies clearly evidenced the existence of a genetic continuum with viruses that did not simply clustered according to the animal species they were isolated from. Three classifications have been successively proposed and allowed to refine the SRLV phylogeny over time. Phylogenetic reconstructions support the existence of SRLV cross-species transmission in domestic and wild small ruminants.

      A survey (1964-1973) was conducted on naturally occurring western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus infections of Richardson's ground squirrels (RGS) in agricultural areas of Saskatchewan. The survey included both serology and virus isolation attempts on live-trapped wild squirrels. Throughout the study, seropostive squirrels were found in the known enzootic regions of the province each summer. The infections rate was high (11.6% of 250) in the epidemic year of 1965 and low (less than 2% of 681) in the subsequent non-epidemic years. The maximal seasonal prevalence of seropositive RGS coincided with the time when the squirrel population and aedine mosquito abundance reached their seasonal peaks. Five virus isolations were obtained from the blood and brains of naturally infected squirrels. All isolations were from squirrels collected in June. The early seasonal infections in squirrels could provide a source of virus for Culex tarsalis, the epidemic vector. In view of their abundance in the enzootic agricultural areas and the high annual population turnover, the RGS may play an important role in the natural history of WEE virus in the Canadian prairies.

      While the importance of viral infections is well studied in domestic cats, only limited information is available on their occurence and prevalence in the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies to feline coronavirus (FCoV), calicivirus (FCV), herpesvirus (FHV), parvovirus (FPV), immunodeficiency virus (FIV), leukemia virus (FeLV), and FeLV antigenemia in 51 European wildcat sera. Samples were collected between 1996 and 1997 from wildcat populations in France, Switzerland, and Germany. Antibodies to FCoV were detected in two cats (4%) and FCoV RNA was detected in feces of one of these two cats. Antibodies to FCV, FHV and FPV were found at relatively low frequencies of 16%, 4%, and 2%, respectively. Antibodies to FIV were not detected. Although antigen and antibodies to FeLV were detected in 49%, and 75%, respectively, no evidence of FeLV-associated pathology was found. From the low prevalence of FCoV, FCV, FHV and FPV infections and from the fact that the European wildcats live solitarily, it was concluded that these viral infections do not spread readily within a population. Therefore, it may be assumed that release into the wild of European wildcats bred in captivity would not bring about a high risk of introducing of these viral infections to the free-ranging wildcats. As an exception, wildcats should be tested for absence of FIV infection before release if they were at risk to acquire this infection from domestic cats.

      The purpose of this study was to characterize the hantaviruses circulating in northwestern Argentina. Human and rodent studies were conducted in Yuto, where most cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) occur. Partial virus genome sequences were obtained from the blood of 12 cases of HPS, and from the lungs of 4 Calomys callosus and 1 Akodon simulator. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three genotypes associated with HPS circulate in Yuto. Laguna Negra (LN) virus, associated with C. laucha in Paraguay, was identified for the first time in Argentina; it was recovered from human cases and from C. callosus samples. The high sequence identity between human and rodent samples implicated C. callosus as the primary rodent reservoir for LN virus in Yuto. The genetic analysis showed that the Argentinian LN virus variant differed 16.8% at the nucleotide level and 2.9% at the protein level relative to the Paraguayan LN virus. The other two hantavirus lineages identified were the previously known Bermejo and Oran viruses.

      Phylogenetic analysis of a 292-nucleotide (nt) fragment of the hantavirus M genome segment from 36 rodent and 13 human samples from three known foci of hantavirus infection in Argentina was conducted. A 1654-nt fragment of the M genome segment was analyzed for 1 representative of 7 genetically distinct hantavirus lineages identified. Additionally, the nt sequence of the complete M genome segments of Lechiguanas, Oran, and Hu39694 hantavirus genotypes was determined. nt sequence comparisons reveal that 7 hantavirus lineages from Argentina differ from each other by 11.5%-21.8% and from Sin Nombre, Bayou, and Black Creek Canal viruses by 23.8%-26.5%. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that they form a unique, separate branch within the clade containing other New World sigmodontine-borne hantaviruses. Most Oligoryzomys-borne hantavirus genotypes clearly map together. The Oligoryzomys-borne genotypes Lechiguanas, Oran, and Andes appear to be associated with human disease. Oligoryzomys longicaudatus was identified as the likely rodent reservoir for Andes virus.

      A competitive-inhibition ELISA (CI-ELISA), based on a monoclonal antibody to an epitope conserved among malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV) strains of both wildebeest and sheep origin, was used to determine the prevalence of antibody to MCFV in selected domestic and wild ruminants, both free-ranging and captive, from the USA. We evaluated 2528 sera from 14 species between 1990 and 1995, including 80 pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana), 339 bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), 103 biston (Bison bison), 17 black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), 395 domestic cattle (Bos taurus), 291 domestic goats (Capra hircus), 680 domestic sheep (Ovis ammon), 323 elk (Cervus elaphus), 41 llamas (Lama glama), 21 mouflon sheep (Ovis musimon), 54 mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), 101 mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), 20 muskox (Ovibos moschatus), and 63 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). A high seroprevalence (37 to 62%) was observed in domestic sheep, domestic goats, muskox, and some bighorn sheep populations. Seroprevalence in these species was generally age-related: a very low seroprevalence was present in these animals under one year of age. A low seroprevalence (2% to 13%) was found in clinically-susceptible species such as domestic cattle, deer, elk and bison, supporting the concept that significant numbers of non-lethal infections occur among clinically susceptible ruminants.

      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged in 2002 to 2003 in southern China. The origin of its etiological agent, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), remains elusive. Here we report that species of bats are a natural host of coronaviruses closely related to those responsible for the SARS outbreak. These viruses, termed SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs), display greater genetic variation than SARS-CoV isolated from humans or from civets. The human and civet isolates of SARS-CoV nestle phylogenetically within the spectrum of SL-CoVs, indicating that the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak was a member of this coronavirus group.

      Harris County, Texas, is an endemic area of St. Louis encephalitis (SLE); and an active surveillance program that monitors SLE virus activity in mosquitoes, birds, and humans has been in place there for the past 28 years. In June of 2002, West Nile (WN) virus appeared in Houston and quickly spread throughout the region. This report describes the results of 12 years of SLE surveillance in Harris County and the contrasting pattern of WN virus activity, when it arrived in 2002. Our data indicate that both SLE and WN viruses can coexist, despite their ecologic, antigenic, and genetic similarities, and that both viruses will probably persist in this geographic region.

      An abattoir survey was carried out on 1657 cattle to determine the incidence and parameters of teat and udder papillomas and their causal viruses. Recent research has characterised six different bovine papillomaviruses of which three have been found to be particularly associated with teat tumours. Of the population studied 37.3 per cent had teat warts and 86.2 per cent of these had multiple infections; 28.4 per cent had papillomas attributed to bovine papillomavirus 1, 88.5 per cent to bovine papillomavirus 5 and 92.3 per cent to bovine papillomavirus 6. There was no predilection site between teats. Herefords and their crosses dominated the breed incidence and showed the highest numbers of warts but it was not possible to make a realistic comparison with other breeds. Dairy cattle were poorly represented. Bovine papillomavirus 4 was never found and from this it was concluded that there is no association between alimentary and teat papillomas. The implications of these findings in terms of prophylaxis and control are discussed.

      A novel alphavirus was isolated from the louse Lepidophthirus macrorhini, collected from southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, on Macquarie Island, Australia. The virus displayed classic alphavirus ultrastructure and appeared to be serologically different from known Australasian alphaviruses. Nearly all Macquarie Island elephant seals tested had neutralizing antibodies against the virus, but no virus-associated pathology has been identified. Antarctic Division personnel who have worked extensively with elephant seals showed no serological evidence of exposure to the virus. Sequence analysis illustrated that the southern elephant seal (SES) virus segregates with the Semliki Forest group of Australasian alphaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of known alphaviruses suggests that alphaviruses might be grouped according to their enzootic vertebrate host class. The SES virus represents the first arbovirus of marine mammals and illustrates that alphaviruses can inhabit Antarctica and that alphaviruses can be transmitted by lice.

      Bovine coronavirus (BCoV), a group 2 member of the genus Coronavirus in the family Coronaviridae, is an important pathogen in cattle worldwide. It causes diarrhea in adult animals (winter dysentery), as well as enteric and respiratory diseases in calves. The annual occurrence of BCoV epidemics in Sweden and Denmark led to this investigation, with the aim to deepen the knowledge of BCoV epidemiology at the molecular level. A total of 43 samples from outbreaks in both countries were used for PCR amplification and direct sequencing of a 624-nucleotide fragment of the BCoV S gene. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic studies were performed. The results showed (i) identical sequences from different animals in the same herds and from paired nasal and fecal samples, suggesting a dominant virus circulating in each herd at a given time; (ii) sequence differences among four outbreaks in different years in the same herd, indicating new introduction of virus; (iii) identical sequences in four different Danish herds in samples obtained within 2 months, implying virus transmission between herds; and (iv) that at least two different virus strains were involved in the outbreaks of BCoV in Denmark during the spring of 2003. This study presents molecular data of BCoV infections that will contribute to an increased understanding of BCoV epidemiology in cattle populations.

      During July 2009 an outbreak in neonates represented with gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms was observed at the Neonatal Postintensive Care Unit, Clinical Hospital Center, Zagreb. Human parechovirus type 1 (HPeV1) was isolated from seven patients, one of whom was asymptomatic. All but one were premature neonates with serious underlying conditions, and all recovered fully after several days. In order to characterize the HPeV1s, sequencing of the VP1/2A region was conducted on six isolates from the outbreak and four isolates detected in Croatia in 2008 and 2007. The analysis of sequence similarity showed that the nucleotide identity between the prototype strain (Harris) and HPeV1 isolated in Croatia was 76.5-77.5%. Croatian strains from 2007 and 2009 clustered together with strains from the Netherlands and Germany detected in 2003 and 2006, respectively, while strains from 2008 clustered with the strain from Finland detected in 2000. Change of the dominant strains each year may suggest antigenic variation as a result of viral response to specific immunity of the target population.

      A cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the prevalence and circulation of bluetongue virus (BTV) in Spanish ibexes (Capra pyrenaica hispanica). A total of 770 sera samples, 380 blood samples and 34 spleen samples were collected between 2006 and 2009 in Andalusia (southern Spain), a region and time period with a wide circulation of BTV in livestock. Thirty-one out of 770 (4.0%; CI(95%): 2.6-5.4) sera samples analyzed by ELISA showed antibodies against BTV. Twenty-four out of 31 seropositive samples were tested against BTV serotypes 1, 4 and 8 by serum neutralization test (SNT). Neutralizing antibodies against BTV-1 and BTV-4 were detected in seven and ten animals, respectively, four of them showed neutralizing antibodies to both serotypes. The animals seropositive to BTV-4 were sampled between 2006 and 2008, while BTV-1 circulation was confirmed in ibexes sampled between 2007 and 2009. None of the ibexes presented neutralizing antibodies against BTV-8. Statistically significant differences were found among regions and years, which is in coincidence with what occurred in domestic ruminants. There were no statistically significant differences between sexes, age classes and habitats (captivity vs. free-living). BTV RNA was not found in any of the 380 blood samples analyzed. However, BTV-1 RNA was detected from spleen in one Spanish ibex from Málaga province in August 2008. This finding evidences the presence of BTV-1 in Spanish ibex in a municipality where BT outbreaks were not detected in domestic ruminants during that period. Results of the present study show that Spanish ibexes were exposed and responded serologically to both BTV-1 and BTV-4. The low seroprevalence obtained suggests that Spanish ibex is not a relevant species in the dissemination of BT. However, the detection of BTV-1 RNA and the presence of seropositive ibexes in areas where BT outbreaks were not detected in livestock, could not exclude a significant role in the epidemiology of BTV in certain areas.

      African horse sickness (AHS) and equine encephalosis (EE) viruses are endemic to southern Africa. AHS virus causes severe epidemics when introduced to naive equine populations, resulting in severe restrictions on the movement of equines between AHS-positive and negative countries. Recent zoning of South Africa has created an AHS-free zone to facilitate equine movement, but the transmission dynamics of these viruses are not fully understood. Here, we present further analyses of serosurveys of donkeys in South Africa conducted in 1983-5 and in 1993-5. Age-prevalence data are used to derive estimates of the force of infection, A. For both viruses, A was highest in the northeastern part of the country and declined towards the southwest. In most of the country, EE virus had a higher transmission rate than AHS. The force of infection increased for EE virus between 1985 and 1993, but decreased for AHS virus. Both viruses showed high levels of variation in transmission between districts within the same province, particularly in areas of intermediate transmission. These data emphasize the focal nature of these viruses, and indicate areas where further data will assist in understanding the geographical variation in transmission.

      A poxvirus was isolated from a wild gerbil (Tatera kempii) caught in northern Dahomey, Africa at the time of an epidemic of human smallpox. Electron microscopic appearance and serologic reactions placed it in the vaccinia subgroup of poxviruses. The isolate differed from ectromelia, rabbitpox, vaccinia, monkeypox, and cowpox viruses in pock morphology on chorioallantoic membrane, ceiling temperature, relative innocuity for mice, and cytopathic effect in tissue culture. Like variola minor virus, it had a ceiling temperature of 38 C, produced small hypertrophic foci in tissue culture, and failed to grow in rabbit skin. Inoculated into a rhesus monkey, it caused fever but no skin eruption and produced seroconversion and protection from subsequent challenge with monkeypox virus. The growing list of animal viruses that differ only slightly from smallpox virus suggests the hypothesis that long-term survival of variola virus may be based on inapparent infection in animals as well as virulent spread among humans.

      Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a genome composed of two ssRNA species, designated L and S. The arenaviruses were divided in two major groups (Old World and New World), based on serological properties and genetic data, as well as geographic distribution. A sequence alignment analysis of all reported arenavirus S RNAs yielded 17 conserved regions in addition to a reported conserved region at the end of both RNAs. The consensus sequences of these regions were used to design generalized primers suitable for RT-PCR amplification of a set of overlapping nucleotide sequence fragments comprising the complete S RNA of any arenavirus. A restriction analysis (RFLP) was designed to rapidly typify the amplified fragments. This RT-PCR-RFLP approach was tested with Old World (LCM) and New World (Junin and Tacaribe) arenaviruses. Furthermore, using this procedure the whole S RNA of a novel arenavirus isolate obtained from a rodent trapped in central Argentina, was amplified and characterized. Partial nucleotide sequence data were used for phylogenetic analyses that showed the relationships between this arenavirus and the rest of the members of the family. This relatively simple methodology will be useful both in basic studies and epidemiological survey programs.

      Surveillance for lyssaviruses was conducted among bat populations in 8 provinces in Thailand. In 2002 and 2003, a total of 932 bats of 11 species were captured and released after serum collection. Lyssavirus infection was determined by conducting virus neutralization assays on bat serum samples. Of collected samples, 538 were either hemolysed or insufficient in volume, which left 394 suitable for analysis. These samples included the following: Pteropus lylei (n = 335), Eonycteris spelaea (n = 45), Hipposideros armiger (n = 13), and Rousettus leschennaulti (n = 1). No serum samples had evidence of neutralizing antibodies when tested against rabies virus. However, 16 samples had detectable neutralizing antibodies against Aravan virus, Khujand virus, Irkut virus, or Australian bat lyssavirus; all were specifically associated with fruit bats P. lylei (n = 15) and E. spelaea (n = 1). These results are consistent with the presence of naturally occurring viruses related to new putative lyssavirus genotypes.

      Healthy animals are of paramount importance in obtaining meaningful, reliable scientific results. Viral infections of rodents often have a significant impact on various types of biomedical research. Laboratory animal specialists and researchers must be aware of the possible consequences associated with the use of infected animals. The objective of the paper is a discussion of the frequently encountered viral infections that can complicate or invalidate the interpretation of results by altering the host's response.

      Over the past 6 years, a number of zoonotic and vectorborne viral diseases have emerged in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Vectorborne disease agents discussed in this article include Japanese encephalitis, Barmah Forest, Ross River, and Chikungunya viruses. However, most emerging viruses have been zoonotic, with fruit bats, including flying fox species as the probable wildlife hosts, and these will be discussed as well. The first of these disease agents to emerge was Hendra virus, formerly called equine morbillivirus. This was followed by outbreaks caused by a rabies-related virus, Australian bat lyssavirus, and a virus associated with porcine stillbirths and malformations, Menangle virus. Nipah virus caused an outbreak of fatal pneumonia in pigs and encephalitis in humans in the Malay Peninsula. Most recently, Tioman virus has been isolated from flying foxes, but it has not yet been associated with animal or human disease. Of nonzoonotic viruses, the most important regionally have been enterovirus 71 and HIV.

      Arthropod-transmitted viruses (Arboviruses) are important causes of disease in humans and animals, and it is proposed that climate change will increase the distribution and severity of arboviral diseases. Orbiviruses are the cause of important and apparently emerging arboviral diseases of livestock, including bluetongue virus (BTV), African horse sickness virus (AHSV), equine encephalosis virus (EEV), and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) that are all transmitted by haematophagous Culicoides insects. Recent changes in the global distribution and nature of BTV infection have been especially dramatic, with spread of multiple serotypes of the virus throughout extensive portions of Europe and invasion of the south-eastern USA with previously exotic virus serotypes. Although climate change has been incriminated in the emergence of BTV infection of ungulates, the precise role of anthropogenic factors and the like is less certain. Similarly, although there have been somewhat less dramatic recent alterations in the distribution of EHDV, AHSV, and EEV, it is not yet clear what the future holds in terms of these diseases, nor of other potentially important but poorly characterized Orbiviruses such as Peruvian horse sickness virus.

      Mouse parvovirus (MPV) infection is difficult to address because it is asymptomatic, persists for as long as 9 wk, and occurs in small subpopulations of mice. The efficacy of a PCR-based cage swabbing strategy for MPV detection was tested. On postinoculation days (PID) 3 through 63, feces were collected from MPV-infected SW mice or the wire bars and cage wall above and below the bedding were swabbed. MPV DNA was detected in all cages in all locations on PID 7 and 14 but only below the bedding on PID 21. Swabbing below the bedding detected MPV in most cages through PID 42. Sentinels exposed to soiled cages on PID 7 and 14 but not on PID 21 seroconverted. MPV was detected in feces from all cages until PID 33 and in at least 1 cage until PID 56. In BALB/c mice, MPV was detected in feces and on cage swabs on PID 5 to 14, and 80% of sentinels exposed to soiled cages on PID 7 and 14 seroconverted. In comparison, MPV infection of C57BL/6 mice was detected in feces on PID 5 to 14 and on swabs on PID 5 and 7, and 30% of sentinels exposed to soiled cages on PID 7 and 14 seroconverted. Swabbing of multiple cages in rows in which only 1 cage contained MPV-infected mice was ineffective. In conclusion, swabbing of individual cages can be used in a genotype-dependent manner as an adjunct to soiled bedding sentinels during the first 2 wk of infection.

      A serological survey of 22 wild-caught South African (Transvaal) chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) and eight olive baboons (Papio anubis) from Kenya indicates that 13 P. ursinus and one P. anubis have antibodies reacting with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type 1 (HTLV-1) antigens, whereas three P. ursinus had a indeterminate reactivity on Western blot analysis. With six primer sets specific to either HTLV-1-Simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) or HTLV-2 and encompassing long terminal repeat (LTR), gag, pol, env, and tax sequences, polymerase chain reaction was performed on genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 18 animals, and the presence of HTLV-1-STLV-1-related viruses was determined in 13 seropositive and three seroindeterminate animals but not in the two HTLV seronegative individuals. Proviral DNA sequences from env (522 bp), pol (120 bp), and complete (755 bp) or partial (514 bp) LTR were determined for three STLV-1-infected P. ursinus and one P. anubis. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses revealed that P. anubis (Pan-486) sequence clusters with one (Pan-1621) of two previously described P. anubis STLV-1. Likewise, P. ursinus viruses (Pur-529, Pur-539, and Pur-543) form a distinct group, different from all known HTLV-1 but closely affiliated with two STLV-1 strains from South African vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus). This study, reporting the first STLV-1 sequences from wild-caught P. ursinus and P. anubis, corroborates the hypothesis of cross-species transmissions of STLV-1 in the wild. Further, phylogenetic analyses indicate that the known HTLV-1 strains do not share a common origin with nonhuman primates STLV in South Africa.

      To test the hypothesis that hibernating colonial bats serve as an overwintering reservoir host of eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) and certain other arthropod-borne viruses in southern New England, 1128 bats of 4 species were collected from 1966 through 1976. Blood and tissue samples and ectoparasites from these bats were tested in suckling mice, wet chicks, and/or chick-embryo tissue cultures for virus. Rabies, the only virus isolated, was recovered from the brain, salivary glands, and brown fat of an apparently healthy adult male Myotis keenii found hibernating in western Massachusetts.

      Serious declines in populations of native European mink (Mustela lutreola) have occurred in Europe. One responsible factor may be infectious diseases introduced by exotic American mink (Mustela vison). In order to investigate a possible role for Aleutian mink disease parvovirus (ADV), we surveyed native riparian carnivores and feral American mink. When serum samples from 12 free-ranging European and 16 feral American mink were tested, antibodies to ADV were detected from three of nine European mink. ADV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction in whole cell DNA from four of seven carcasses; two American mink, one European mink and a Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra). Lesions typical of Aleutian disease were present in one of the American mink. A portion of the ADV VP2 capsid gene was sequenced and the results suggested that two sequence types of ADV were circulating in Spain, and that the Spanish ADVs differed from other described isolates from North America and Europe. Future conservation and restoration efforts should include measures to avoid introduction or spread of ADV infection to native animals.

      A simple, rapid and specific diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed for sheep poxvirus identification. The primers used were from the sequenced genomes of the capripox viruses KS-1 and InS-1. Six different sheep pox isolates were tested against two orf (parapox) and three animal herpesviruses as controls. Material from uninfected cell cultures was also used as control. The sensitivity of the PCR was approximately equivalent with each of the two primers and for the six sheep pox isolates. All the negative control virus DNAs were negative and differed clearly from those of the sheep pox strains.

      Serum samples from 128 wild vicuñas (Vicugna vicugna) were tested for antibodies (Ab) to rotavirus (RV), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3), bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV-1), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), bluetongue virus (BTV), equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1), and influenza A virus equine (EIV). Samples were collected in Cieneguillas Province of Jujuy, in northern Argentina. Feces from 44 vicuñas were also collected to investigate RV shedding. Llamas (Lama glama) and domestic cattle (Bos taurus) from the area studied also were tested for antibodies to these viruses. Antibodies against RV (100%) and BPIV-3 (37%) were detected in the vicuñas sampled. No RV antigen was detected in any of the fecal samples tested. One vicuña was positive for Ab to BHV-1 (0.8%) and another for BVDV-1 (0.8%). The Ab prevalences detected in llamas were: 100% (16/16) for RV, 47% (8/17) for BPIV-3, 17.6% (3/17) for BHV-1, and 5.9% (1/17) for BVDV-1. However, domestic cattle had high antibody prevalences for RV and BPIV-3, 100% (13/13) and 73% (11/15), respectively, but were negative for Ab to BHV-1 and BVDV. No antibodies against FMDV, BTV, EHV-1, or EIV were detected in wild vicuñas or domestic species. Because no data of viral circulation on wild vicuñas are available, this report represents the first evidence of viral infection in wild vicuñas from the Argentinean Andean Puna.

      Data are presented from serological and virological investigations of natural and experimental infections, in rodents, with different poxviruses. The demonstration of poxvirus antibodies (virus neutralizing antibodies, antihaemagglutinins, and precipitins) in the kidneys and/or lungs of rodents from Europe and Africa, and the isolation of poxviruses from them, all indicate that rodents may be poxvirus carriers. Isolates from rodents differed in their properties. Some, from Turkmenistan rodents or from white rats caught near Moscow, appeared to be very close to cowpox virus, while others (from Zaire rodents) were identical to variola-like (whitepox) viruses found earlier in monkeys in the same region. The results suggest that rodents that carry the virus closely similar to cowpox virus might be a source of infection for other animal species.

      A new poxvirus was isolated in 1974 from the kidney of a wild big gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) caught in Turkmenia, where these gerbils are wide-spread. The virus resembles cowpox virus and is markedly different from the virus of infectious ectromelia, the best-known poxvirus of rodents. The new virus is apparently identical to other poxvirus isolates made from white rats and Felidae in the Moscow Zoo. Experimental inoculation of the natural hosts--big gerbils and yellow susliks (Citellus fulvus)--produced a severe infection with a high mortality rate. Trnasmission of virus to uninoculated cage mates was shown to occur. Virus persisted in convalescent animals and was present in urine 3 weeks after inoculation and in kidney and testis for at least 5 weeks after inoculation. The role of rodents as natural hosts of poxviruses is discussed.

      A virus given the name ground squirrel hepatitis virus (or GSHV), with many of the unique characteristics of human hepatitis B virus (HBV), has been found in Beechey ground squirrels in northern California. Common features include virus morphology, viral DNA size and structure, a virion DNA polymerase that repairs a single-stranded region in the viral DNA, crossreacting viral antigens, and persistent infection with viral antigen continuously in the blood. Although similar, GSHV and HBV Are not identical. The ground squirrel virion has a slightly greater diameter, the viral surface antigens crossreact only partially and, thus, are not identical, and GSHV DNA has two restriction endonuclease EcoRI cleavage sites in contrast to the single site in HBV DNA. Thus, GSHV is a member of the virus group that includes HBV and the virus recently found in woodchucks in the eastern United States and named woodchuck hepatitis virus. It is not yet known how closely the ground squirrel and woodchuck viruses are related.

      Lagos bat virus (LBV) belongs to genotype 2 of the Lyssavirus genus. The complete nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrixprotein (M) and glycoprotein (G) genes of 13 LBV isolates were sequenced and phylogenetically compared with other lyssavirus representatives. The results identified three different lineages of LBV. One of these lineages demonstrated sufficient sequence diversity to be considered a new lyssavirus genotype (Dakar bat lyssavirus). The suggested quantitative separation of lyssavirus genotypes using the N, P, M and G genes was also investigated using P-distances matrixes. Results indicated that the current criteria should be revised since overlaps between intergenotypic and intragenotypic variation occur.

      African lions (Panthera leo) are susceptible to viral diseases of domestic carnivores, including feline calici-virus infection. We report the identification of a novel enteric calicivirus, genetically related to human noroviruses of genogroup IV, in a lion cub that died of severe hemorrhagic enteritis.

      Whether animals may act as reservoirs for human caliciviruses is unclear. By sequence analysis of a short fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region, porcine sapovirus (SaV) strains that genetically resemble human SaVs have been detected in piglets, but more-informative sequences (capsid gene) were not available for a precise characterization. In this study, the 3' terminus (the 3' end of open reading frame 1 [ORF1], including the polymerase complex and the complete capsid; ORF2; and the 3' untranslated region) of one such human SaV-like strain, 43/06-18p3/2006/It, was determined, revealing that these viruses are more related genetically to human (47.4 to 54.9% amino acid identity) than to animal (35.2 to 44.7% amino acid identity) SaVs in the capsid gene. In addition, the recombination-prone RdRp-capsid junction region was highly conserved with those of human SaVs of genogroup GI. The presence of porcine viruses similar to human SaVs is a significant finding because of the potential for zoonotic infections or generation of porcine/human recombinants.

      Anellovirus is a recently created, floating genus of viruses. Torque teno virus (TTV), the type species in the genus, was first discovered in a human patient with a post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology. Recently, TTV genetically related to but distinct from those discovered in humans have also been found in animals, including pigs. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of swine TTV in Italian pig herds and some risk factors possibly associated with this infection. Serum samples from 179 healthy pigs from 10 farms located in north-central Italy were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of swine TTV DNA. Viral DNA was found in the sera of 43 pigs (24.0%), coming from eight of the 10 farms examined. Prevalence was significantly higher in finishing herds (40.1%) than in farrow-to-finish herds (11.0%) and did not depend on the size of the herd. Within the finishing herds the prevalence was significantly higher in weaners (57.4%) than in fatteners (22.9%), but this difference was not observed in farrow-to-finish herds. No relationship was observed between the prevalence of swine TTV and the implementation of some general hygiene practices and biosecurity procedures within the herds.

      A picobirnavirus (PBV) analysis was carried out by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 513 stool samples obtained from 150 animal species collected from the Córdoba city zoo. The purpose of the present study was to determine susceptible species for PBV infection, the viral excretion pattern in infected animals, and the potential association with PBV diarrheic illness. Our findings suggest that PBVs are widespread in animals and could have a similar excretion behavior to that previously detected in infected humans. No disease association with PBV infection could be demonstrated. Thus, infected animals could be persistently infected asymptomatic carriers and could serve as reservoirs of infection.

      The first isolation and partial characterization of bovine foamy virus (BFV), also known as bovine syncytial virus, in Poland is described. This virus was isolated by co-cultivation of peripheral blood leukocytes from infected cattle with permissive Cf2Th cells. The new isolate, called BFV100 was identified using several techniques: electron microscopy, western blotting, PCR and sequencing of a part of the gag and pol/env genes. Based on syncytia induction, antigenic determinants, primer binding sites and sequence analysis, it can be concluded that isolate BFV100 is bovine foamy virus and is related to the known American and German BFV isolates by sequence homology and antigenic relatedness.

      In a plantar cyst composed of the wall of the squamous cell layer and the horny inner substance in the lower dermis, we found characteristic pathological changes, such as cytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions and vacuolated structure, and, immunohistochemically, the papillomavirus capsid antigen. The human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA cloned from the cyst showed no homology with other known prototypes of HPV (HPV 1 through HPV 59) by Southern blot analysis under stringent conditions and was named as HPV 60. HPV 60 DNA was found in three other cases of plantar cyst with the identical pathological changes, but not in a plantar cyst without such changes. The results suggest that HPV 60 has unique biological properties to induce a plantar cyst as a distinct type of cutaneous HPV.

      The complete genomic sequence of canine calicivirus (CaCV) isolated from feces of a dog with diarrhea was determined. The CaCV genome, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA, contained 8513 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tail and was longer than that of any other calicivirus strain with a completely known sequence. There were three open reading frames (ORF1, nt 12-5801; ORF2, nt 5805-7880; and ORF3, nt 7877-8278). ORF1 encoded a polyprotein (calculated Mr of 214,802) which had the conserved motifs of non-structural proteins of other caliciviruses and picornaviruses. Regions containing characteristic motifs in the non-structural polyprotein of CaCV showed highest similarity with those of the species Feline calicivirus and Vesicular exanthema of swine virus in the genus Vesivirus. Phylogenic analysis indicated that CaCV formed a distinct branch within the genus. Our results strongly suggested that CaCV is a new species in the genus Vesivirus.

      An outbreak of classical herpetic infection causing vesicoulcerative stomatitis in a family group (eight animals) of Callithrix jacchus is described. In all eight infected animals, human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) was identified as the causative agent. This was confirmed by histologic, immunohistologic, and molecular biologic investigations, as well as by virus isolation. The clinical picture, the macroscopic appearance, and the histologic results indicated a herpes infection as the cause of mortality. Alterations of the oral mucous membranes were erosive to ulcerative with typical intranuclear inclusions. Immunohistologic and molecular biologic techniques clearly identified the HHV-1 virus and excluded other possible primate herpesviruses such as B-virus, SA8, HVP-2, and Herpes tamarinus. The significance of this herpesvirus infection for colony management is discussed.

      Two genotypes (Jena and Newbury2) and two intergenotype recombinant strains have been recognized in bovine noroviruses. Several studies have shown an apparent predominance of bovine infection with Newbury2-related (genotype 2) strains. Bovine stool samples were screened with two primer pairs targeting both the polymerase and the capsid genes. Among the predominant genotype 2 sequences, two were genetically related to the recombinant strain Thirsk10. The detection of sequences genetically related to Thirsk10, together with the very low rate of detection of Jena-related sequences, characterized the bovine norovirus population in Belgium, a representative region of continental Europe. Unexpectedly, bovine kobuvirus-related sequences were also amplified, extending their distribution area in Europe.

      Viral, bacterial and parasitological infections in rats and mice used in biomedical research continue to occur despite improved housing and biosurveillance. The presence of disease in laboratory animals can lead to spurious results for research undertaken in universities, research institutes and the pharmaceutical industry. Here the authors report the results of serological, microbiological, parasitological and molecular tests done on mice and rats from Australasia submitted to a rodent health monitoring laboratory (Cerberus Sciences) from 2004 to 2009. In tested mice, norovirus was the most prevalent virus and ectromelia virus was the least prevalent virus. In tested rats, pneumonia virus of mice was the most prevalent virus and adenoviruses 1 and 2 were the least prevalent viruses. In mice, Helicobacter hepaticus was the most prevalent bacterium, and in rats, Proteus spp. were the most prevalent bacteria. The most common positive helminthological finding in mice and rats was the presence of all pinworms (including Aspicularis spp. and Syphacia spp.). The most common positive protozoan findings in mice and rats were Chilomastix spp. and Trichomonads.

      The involvement of porcupines, Erethizon dorsatum (L.), in the ecology of Colorado tick fever (CTF) virus in Rocky Mountain National Park was investigated from 1975 to 1977. Porcupine dens and feeding activity were found mostly on rocky knolls or on south-facing slopes within open stands of the montane coniferous forest, and 20 adult porcupines were trapped or captured by hand at those locations. An average of 24.6 +/- 5.4 adult Dermacentor andersoni Stiles ticks were found per animal (annual range, 17.5-31.4 ticks). The minimum CTF virus infection rate of the ticks removed from porcupines varied from 129 to 257, whereas for questing adult D. andersoni ticks from the same geographic area was 205 in 1976. No virus was isolated from the 20 animals, but 85% had neutralizing antibody against CTF virus. Porcupines utilize the same habitats described for the CTF ecosystem in Rocky Mountain National Park and appear to be an important host for adult D. andersoni.

      Powassan virus isolations were achieved from three of 60 pools of Ixodes cookei ticks removed from 286 groundhogs (Marmota monax) which were collected some 200 miles north of Toronto between May 5 and September 5, 1966. Virus yields per pool of one to 11 ticks ranged from 10(2.5) to 10(6.0) TCD(50) for primary swine kidney tissue cultures, and positive pools were collected on June 24, July 15 and August 10. Powassan neutralizing antibodies were detected by mouse inoculation tests in 143 of 362 animals including 127 of 286 groundhogs, 14 of 45 red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and two of 31 other forest mammals. The monthly prevalence of antibody in the current season's groundhogs increased from 0 to 25% with the progression of summer, but in older animals the incidence remained between 38 and 62% throughout the season. These results substantiate earlier findings which pointed towards the maintenance of Powassan virus in nature by a cycle involving groundhogs and squirrels as reservoirs, with ticks as vectors, from which human infections occurred tangentially.

      Potosi (POT) virus (Bunyaviridae) was isolated from Aedes albopictus, an introduced Asian mosquito species, collected at a used tire yard in Potosi, Missouri (USA), in August and September, 1989. In September, 1990, small animals were trapped at the tire yard and six cattle were sampled at an adjacent farm; in November 1990 and 1991, blood samples were collected with filter paper strips from 364 hunter-killed, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the region to determine the possible reservoir hosts of the virus. Deer specimens from Arkansas (n = 70), Colorado (n = 29), and Iowa (n = 763) (USA) were also analyzed. Specimens from 33 small vertebrates captured at the tire yard were negative for viruses. Only one eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) and none of six cattle had neutralizing (N) antibody against POT virus by the plaque-reduction serum neutralization test in Vero cell culture but 45 (25%) of 178 deer specimens in 1990 and 55 (30%) of 186 in 1991 were antibody positive. The 186 deer sera from 1991 were tested further and 29 (16%) were also N antibody positive to Cache Valley (CV) virus. From the 763 deer specimens tested from Iowa in 1993, 114 (15%) had N antibody to POT virus. Of 70 serum specimens from Arkansas deer in 1990, 33 (47%) had N antibody to POT and 15 (21%) to CV viruses; two (7%) of 29 CV negative serum specimens from Colorado deer in 1981 were serologically positive to POT virus. Three eastern chipmunks were experimentally inoculated with POT virus to determine their reservoir potential; none became viremic but all developed N antibody. Thus we propose that POT virus may be another virus regularly infecting wild deer populations but its impact on the health of these animals is unknown.

      A survey of antibodies to bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) known as bovine lentivirus and bovine leukemia virus (BLV) was conducted with samples from water buffalo and cattle populations in Pakistan. A total of 370 water buffaloes and 76 cattle were tested, and 10.3% and 15.8%, respectively, were found positive for anti-BIV p26 antibodies determined by Western blotting, while 0.8% of water buffaloes and no cattle were positive for anti-BLV antibodies determined by immunodiffusion test. BIV-seropositive water buffaloes and cattle were found to have BIV proviral DNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells determined by nested polymerase chain reaction. This is the first report of BIV infections in water buffaloes.

      Group B rotaviruses (RV-B) were first identified in piglet feces, being later associated with diarrhea in humans, cattle, lambs, and rats. In human beings, the virus was only described in China, India, and Bangladesh, especially infecting adults. Only a few studies concerning molecular analysis of the RV-B NSP2 gene have been conducted, and porcine RV-B has not been characterized. In the present study, three porcine wild-type RV-B strains from piglet stool samples collected from Brazilian pig herds were used for analysis. PAGE results were inconclusive for those samples, but specific amplicons of the RV-B NSP2 gene (segment 8) were obtained in a semi-nested PCR assay. The three porcine RV-B strains showed the highest nucleotide identity with the human WH1 strain and the alignments with other published sequences resulted in three groups of strains divided according to host species. The group of human strains showed 92.4 to 99.7% nucleotide identity while the porcine strains of the Brazilian RV-B group showed 90.4 to 91.8% identity to each other. The identity of the Brazilian porcine RV-B strains with outer sequences consisting of group A and C rotaviruses was only 35.3 to 38.8%. A dendrogram was also constructed to group the strains into clusters according to host species: human, rat, and a distinct third cluster consisting exclusively of the Brazilian porcine RV-B strains. This is the first study of the porcine RV-B NSP2 gene that contributes to the partial characterization of this virus and demonstrates the relationship among RV-B strains from different host species.

      Andes virus (ANDV) is the predominant etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in southern South America. In Chile, serologically confirmed human hantavirus infections have occurred throughout a wide latitudinal distribution extending from the regions of Valparaíso (32 to 33 degrees S) to Aysén (46 degrees S) in southern Patagonia. In this study, we found seropositive rodents further north in the Coquimbo region (30 degrees S) in Chile. Rodent seroprevalence was 1.4%, with Oligoryzomys longicaudatus displaying the highest seroprevalence (5.9%), followed by Abrothrix longipilis (1.9%) and other species exhibiting </=0.6% seropositivity. We sequenced partial ANDV small (S) segment RNA from 6 HCPS patients and 32 rodents of four different species collected throughout the known range of hantavirus infection in Chile. Phylogenetic analyses showed two major ANDV South (ANDV Sout) clades, congruent with two major Chilean ecoregions, Mediterranean (Chilean matorral [shrubland]) and Valdivian temperate forest. Human and rodent samples grouped according to geographic location. Phylogenetic comparative analyses of portions of S and medium segments (encoding glycoproteins Gn and Gc) from a subset of rodent specimens exhibited similar topologies, corroborating two major ANDV Sout clades in Chile and suggesting that yet unknown factors influence viral gene flow and persistence throughout the two Chilean ecoregions. Genetic algorithms for recombination detection identified recombination events within the S segment. Molecular demographic analyses showed that the virus is undergoing purifying selection and demonstrated a recent exponential growth in the effective number of ANDV Sout infections in Chile that correlates with the increased number of human cases reported. Although we determined virus sequences from four rodent species, our results confirmed O. longicaudatus as the primary ANDV Sout reservoir in Chile. While evidence of geographic differentiation exists, a single cosmopolitan lineage of ANDV Sout remains the sole etiologic agent for HCPS in Chile.

      Previous evidence implicating paramyxoviruses in the aetiopathology of Paget's disease of bone has been controversial. While several groups have demonstrated the presence of paramyxoviruses using electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and molecular biological techniques, others have found no evidence of viruses using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We have previously provided evidence that canine distemper virus (CDV) is present in approximately 65% of samples of pagetic bone, using in situ hybridization and RT-PCR; however, these results have been criticized. To further investigate the possible Role of CDV, we have now developed the technique of in situ-RT-PCR (IS-RT-PCR) to examine for the presence of CDV-nucleocapsid (CDV-N) ribonucleic acid (RNA) in pagetic bone. Control samples consisted of uninvolved sites from patients with the disease, normal bone, and several active remodeling states. IS-RT-PCR was optimized to detect CDV-N using distemper-infected vero cells. The specificity of the technique was confirmed using vero cells infected with CDV, which showed amplified signal following IS-RT-PCR, and cells infected with measles virus (MV), in which no positive signal for CDV was detected by IS-RT-PCR. Following conventional in situ hybridization, CDV-N was detectable in 10 of 15 pagetic bone samples. However, after five, and particularly 10, cycles of IS-RT-PCR, CDV-N was found in all 15 samples. There was no evidence of CDV in four samples from uninvolved sites from pagetic patients, or in any of the other control samples. In this study, using the novel technique of IS-RT-PCR, CDV was found to be present in 100% of pagetic samples examined. There was no evidence of the virus in any of the control samples, including samples of bone from uninvolved sites from patients with Paget's disease. These results provide additional proof that CDV is present within pagetic bone and further support the hypothesis that paramyxoviruses are involved in the etiopathology of Paget's disease.

      Among eight samples obtained from a French primatology research center, six adult guinea baboons (Papio hamadryas papio), caught in the wild in Senegal, had a peculiar human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (HTLV-2)-like Western blot seroreactivity (p24(+), GD21(+), K55(+/-)). Partial sequence analyses of the tax genes (433 bp) indicated that these baboons were infected by a novel divergent simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV). Analyses of the complete proviral sequence (8,892 bp) for one of these strains (STLV-3/PPA-F3) indicate that this STLV was highly divergent from the HTLV-1 (61.6% of nucleotide similarity), HTLV-2 (61.2%), or STLV-2 (60.6%) prototype. It was, however, much more closely related to the few other known STLV-3 strains, exhibiting 87 and 89% of nucleotide similarity with STLV-3/PHA-PH969 (formerly PTLV-L/PH969) and STLV-3/CTO-604, respectively. The STLV-3/PPA-F3 sequence possesses the major HTLV or STLV open reading frames corresponding to the structural, enzymatic, and regulatory proteins. However, its long terminal repeat comprises only two 21-bp repeats. In all phylogenetic analyses, STLV-3/PPA-F3 clustered together in a highly supported single clade with the other known strains of STLV-3, indicating an independent evolution from primate T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (PTLV-1) and PTLV-2. The finding of a new strain of STLV-3 in a West African monkey (Guinea baboon) greatly enlarges the geographical distribution and the host range of species infected by this PTLV type in the African continent. The recent discovery of several different STLV-3 strains in many different African monkey species, often in contact with humans, strongly suggests potential interspecies transmission events, as it was described for STLV-1, between nonhuman primates but also to humans.

      Although canine distemper is enzootic worldwide and has a wide host range, there are no reports of canine distemper virus in crab-eating foxes (Cerdocyon thous) that provide information on virus phylogeny and histopathologic lesions. The objective of this study is report and describe canine distemper in a crab-eating fox (C. thous), with a focus on the phylogeny of the virus strain and the histopathologic lesions in the animal.

      Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a small, non-enveloped, single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus of approximately 7.2kb in size. HEV is classified in the family Hepeviridae consisting of four recognized major genotypes that infect humans and other animals. Genotypes 1 and 2 HEV are restricted to humans and often associated with large outbreaks and epidemics in developing countries with poor sanitation conditions, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 HEV infect humans, pigs and other animal species and are responsible for sporadic cases of hepatitis E in both developing and industrialized countries. The avian HEV associated with Hepatitis-Splenomegaly syndrome in chickens is genetically and antigenically related to mammalian HEV, and likely represents a new genus in the family. There exist three open reading frames in HEV genome: ORF1 encodes non-structural proteins, ORF2 encodes the capsid protein, and the ORF3 encodes a small phosphoprotein. ORF2 and ORF3 are translated from a single bicistronic mRNA, and overlap each other but neither overlaps ORF1. Due to the lack of an efficient cell culture system and a practical animal model for HEV, the mechanisms of HEV replication and pathogenesis are poorly understood. The recent identification and characterization of animal strains of HEV from pigs and chickens and the demonstrated ability of cross-species infection by these animal strains raise potential public health concerns for zoonotic HEV transmission. It has been shown that the genotypes 3 and 4 HEV strains from pigs can infect humans, and vice versa. Accumulating evidence indicated that hepatitis E is a zoonotic disease, and swine and perhaps other animal species are reservoirs for HEV. A vaccine against HEV is not yet available.

      Since its detection in China in 1984, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) has been the subject of numerous studies. Yet, the evolutionary origin of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is still under debate. For example, some aspects related to the epidemiology of the disease are still unknown, such as where the virus is hosted between RHD outbreaks. To detect the presence of RHDV in rabbit-sympatric micromammals, 51 rodents (29 Mus spretus and 22 Apodemus sylvaticus) and 31 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) from the same location in central Spain were analyzed. In those samples in which the virus was detected, a fragment of the VP60 protein gene from the RHDV capsid was sequenced and the phylogenetic relationships between them and other strains of RHDV in the Iberian Peninsula were analyzed. In total, five viral strains were identified in A. sylvaticus, M. spretus and O. cuniculus. All strains were found to be well supported within the clade of RHDV found in rabbits in the Iberian Peninsula. Moreover, one of the strains was found in all three species under study, which suggests the capability of RHDV to infect other mammals apart from the rabbit which have not yet been investigated. The transmission of the virus is discussed as well as its ecoepidemiological implications.

      An identifiable strain of myxoma virus was introduced into four local populations of wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus on the southern tablelands of New South Wales (NSW) and its spread in the presence of other field strains was monitored for 6 months. The main vector in this region was considered to be the European rabbit flea Spilopsyllis cuniculi. Each population of rabbits was of a high density and living in groups of warrens covering areas from 59 to 87 hectares. Rabbits occupying centrally located warrens were inoculated with the virus in late September or early October (spring) and the subsequent appearance of myxomatosis across the sites monitored by trapping, shooting and visual observations. Samples, taken from rabbits with myxomatosis, were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that allowed identification of the introduced strain. On all four sites the introduced virus spread from the inoculated rabbits in the centrally located warrens to rabbits in surrounding warrens. On Sites 1 and 3, this spread continued across the entire site persisting for at least 118 and 174 days respectively. On Sites 2 and 4, the virus was detected for 78 and 62 days respectively and the subsequent inability to detect the introduced virus correlated with the appearance of an unrelated field strain. Using three different methods of calculation, rates of spread ranged from 3.7 to 17.8 m d(-1).

      Laboratory rabbits from various commercial and private sources were found to have high serum antibody titers specific for lapine parvovirus (LPV). By both immunofluorescence and hemagglutination inhibition assays, 75% of these sera were positive for LPV. This finding, together with the recovery of LPV from kidneys of neonatal rabbits, suggested that LPV infection is common in commercially available rabbits in the United States. It was concluded that use of infected rabbits could interfere with research in which rabbit cell cultures or in vitro immunologic assays are used.

      Blood samples from 4893 cricetid rodents were tested for antibody (immunoglobulin G) to Whitewater Arroyo virus and Amaparí virus to extend our knowledge of the natural host range and geographical distribution of Tacaribe serocomplex viruses in North America. Antibodies to arenaviruses were found in northern pygmy mice (Baiomys taylori), woodrats (Neotoma spp.), northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster), oryzomys (Oryzomys spp.), deermice (Megadontomys nelsoni and Peromyscus spp.), harvest mice (Reithrodontomys spp.), and cotton rats (Sigmodon spp.) captured in New Mexico, Texas, or Mexico. Comparison of endpoint antibody titers to Whitewater Arroyo virus and Amaparí virus in individual blood samples indicated that the Tacaribe complex viruses enzootic in Texas and Mexico are antigenically diverse.

      A serologic survey of swift fox (Vulpes velox) and kit fox (V. macrotis) from the western USA was conducted for 12 infectious diseases. Samples from swift fox were collected between 1987 and 1992 from Colorado (n = 44), Kansas (n = 10), and Wyoming (n = 9). Samples from kit fox were collected in California (n = 86), New Mexico (n = 18), Utah (n = 9), and Arizona (n = 6). Overall antibody prevalence rates were 33 of 110 (30%) for canine parvovirus (CPV), 9 of 72 (13%) for canine distemper virus (CDV), 23 of 117 (20%) for vesicular stomatitis New Jersey, 16 of 117 (14%) for vesicular stomatitis Indiana, six of 117 (5%) for Cache Valley virus, five of 117 (4%) for Jamestown Canyon virus, one of 97 (1%) for rabies virus, one of 117 (1%) for Colorado tick fever virus, and one of 117 (1%) for western equine encephalitis virus. In addition, antibodies were not found to Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Borrelia burgdorferi in serum from 25 Colorado swift fox. Adult swift fox from Colorado had serologic evidence of exposure to CPV more often than juveniles. No juvenile swift fox from Colorado had serum antibodies to CDV. There were season-specific differences in serum antibody prevalence for CPV for swift fox from Colorado. No viruses were isolated from ectoparasites or fox from Colorado.

      Oliveros virus is an agent isolated in cell culture from Bolomys obscurus (Rodentia, Muridae, Sigmodontinae) captured on the central Argentine pampa. Oliveros virus was shown to be related to members of the Tacaribe complex of the family Arenaviridae by immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) tests, electrophoretic pattern of viral proteins, and morphology as observed by electron microscopy. It was distinct from 12 other arenaviruses by a combination of plaque-reduction neutralization tests, comparison of endpoint titers among cross-IFA tests, and comparison of viral RNA sequence data. This agent is the third new arenavirus from South America described within the last three years.

      Oliveros virus (OLV) is an arenavirus hosted by the sigmodontine rodent, Necromys benefactus, in central Argentina. We report a 3-year longitudinal field study of the dynamics of OLV infection in host populations from 15 localities in two provinces on the central Argentine pampa. There was an overall 3-year period immunofluorescent antibody prevalence of 25% in the host population, and infected hosts were found throughout the study area. Spill-over infection into common sympatric species was rare. Infection dynamics exhibited many of the patterns seen for other rodent-borne arenaviruses and hantaviruses, but had some unique characteristics. Host population density was highest in autumn and lowest in spring, while antibody prevalence was highest in spring and lowest in autumn. Virus transmission was horizontal: infection was strongly associated with age, reaching 45% prevalence in the oldest individuals, and prevalence of infection was equal among male and female hosts. Infection may have been associated with scars, which were also approximately equally distributed among male and female Necromys.

      We report the results of indirect fluorescent antibody screening for antibody to Junin virus in 1,101 sera from small mammals captured on two mark-recapture grids in the epidemic area of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Twenty-six of 29 seropositive animals were the cricetid rodent Calomys musculinus, for a 30-month prevalence of 7.9% in that species. Combining these data with previously published data on antigen detection provided an estimated total prevalence of infection of 10.9% for this, the principal reservoir species. Other infected species included two cricetids, C. laucha and Bolomys obscurus, and a predatory carnivore, Galictis cuja. Approximately half of infected animals simultaneously carried serum antibody and antigen in blood and saliva, some for 29-61 days. Except for C. laucha, which was associated with crop habitats, seropositive animals were strongly associated with the relatively rare roadside and fence-line habitats. Seropositive C. musculinus were predominantly males in the oldest age and heaviest body mass classes, and seropositive males were twice as likely to have body scars as seronegative males. These observations suggest that most infections were acquired through horizontal transmission and that aggressive encounters among adult, male C. musculinus in relatively densely populated roadside and fence-line habitats are an important mechanism of transmission of Junin virus within reservoir populations.

      Small mammals were trapped during a 21-month period at 27 farm sites in 15 localities within and beyond the known endemic area for Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). Prevalence of Junin virus (JV) was assessed by antigen-capture enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) on samples of body fluids and/or organs from 3, 282 captured rodents. Infection in rodent populations was variable (0-3.7%) among localities but, in all cases, was lower than previously reported rates. Overall prevalence was 1.4% in the AHF epidemic area, 0.6% in the historic (currently low incidence of AHF) area, and 0.4% in two localities beyond the previously defined endemic area. These low values underestimate the actual prevalence of JV, as ELISA validation by virus isolation indicated a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 99%. Of 37 positive rodents, 28 (76%) were of two species: Calomys musculinus (23 animals) and C. laucha (5 animals). Antigen also was found in three Akodon azarae, four Bolomys obscurus, one Mus musculus, and one Oxymycterus rufus, and JV was isolated from two Oligoryzomys flavescens. Three of these rodent species (B. obscurus, O. flavescens, and O. rufus) have heretofore not been implicated in JV maintenance in the field. Evidence suggests that the AHF endemic area may continue to expand northward.

      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is widespread in humans world-wide. The virus, which is linked to Burkitt's and Hodgkin lymphoma in humans, has recently been detected in pet dogs in Taiwan. The aim of this study was to determine if EBV is present in other canine populations, whether infection is associated with lymphoma in dogs, and whether infection is present in cats. Canine and feline serum samples were analysed by immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies to EBV or an EBV-like virus were detected in 38.4% of UK dog sera, 64% of US dog sera and 38% of cat sera. Canine blood samples, tissue samples from the palatine tonsil and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from canine lymphoma cases were analysed by PCR. Using EBV-specific primers, EBV was detected in one tonsil sample, whereas all other samples tested were negative. PCR using consensus herpesvirus primers identified canine herpesvirus in twelve tonsil samples and one biopsy but no gammaherpesviruses were detected. Canine blood samples from EBV antibody-positive dogs were analysed by RT-PCR to determine if transcripts associated with lytic EBV infection (BcLF1) or latency (LMP2) were present, however all samples tested were negative. In conclusion, there is serological evidence of exposure to EBV or an EBV-like virus in dogs and cats but persistent infection in the canine palatine tonsil is rare and no evidence was found of EBV in canine peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effect of EBV on canine and feline cells and the possible outcome of the infection for the host require further investigation.

      A unique hepatitis B virus (HBV) variant has been identified in a gibbon (Hylobates lar) which could be passed to a chimpanzee by experimental inoculation. This HBV variant had been shown to have no reactivity to a monoclonal anti-preS2 antibody (preS2 mAb 116-34) differentiating it from all human HBV specimens tested. This gibbon sera also was not recognized by an anti-preS1 mAb which binds the preS1 hepatocyte receptor region, amino acids 27-35. In this paper, we report the DNA sequence of the gibbon HBV PreS gene. The lack of preS2 mAb (116-34) binding can be explained by a unique nucleotide substitution of A for C in the second codon of the preS2 region leading to the replacement of glutamine with lysine. Two other unique changes were observed at the seventh and 24th amino acid positions in the preS2 gene leading to a substitution of a valine for threonine and alanine, respectively. Unlike all human derived HBV sequences in the preS1 region, the gibbon HBV had a glutamic acid instead of an aspartic acid at amino acid residue 27. Another unique substitution was a leucine for alanine at preS1 position 33. These amino acid changes in the gibbon HBV may explain its unique preS mAb reactivity.

      Sera and livers from 40 Richardson ground squirrels were examined for evidence of ground squirrel hepatitis virus (GSHV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty-five sera were obtained from fully grown adult ground squirrels and 15 from young ground squirrels estimated to be between 6-8 weeks of age. All animals had been caught in the wild and had spent less than 1 month in captivity. Sixteen sera (40%) had at least one serologic marker of GSHV (2 with GSHV surface antigen, 3 GSHV core antigen, 5 GSHV antibody to core antigen and 11 GSHV antibody to surface antigen). Two cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were detected, both in adult ground squirrels. Tumour tissue and adjacent normal liver tissue were negative for GSHV surface and core antigen by direct immunofluorescence in both livers and negative for GSHV-DNA by molecular hybridization in the one tumour examined. These results indicate that: A) GSHV is geographically more widespread than previously considered; B) viral transmission occurs early in life, probably via the vertical route; and C) hepatocellular carcinoma is a relatively common finding in these animals while still in their wild state. Any causal relationship between hepatocellular carcinoma and GSHV infection in these animals, however, has yet to be demonstrated.

      The 2008 Reston ebolavirus infection event in domestic pigs has triggered continuing epidemiologic investigations among Philippine health and veterinary agencies in collaboration with international filovirus experts. Prior to this, there were only 3 known and documented Reston ebolavirus outbreaks in nonhuman primates in the world, all traced back to a single geographic source in the Philippines in a monkey breeding/export facility. The first one in 1989 was the first-ever Ebola virus that emerged outside of Africa and was also the first known natural infection of Ebola virus in nonhuman primates. When it was first discovered among laboratory monkeys in the United States, the source was immediately traced back to the farm located in the Philippines. The second outbreak was in 1992-93. The third episode in 1996 was the last known outbreak before Reston ebolavirus reemerged in pigs in 2008. The isolated outbreaks involving 2 animal species bring forth issues requiring further investigations, and highlight the significance of intersectoral collaboration to effectively address zoonoses prevention and control/response in the interest of minimizing public health risk.

      Since cattle are widely infected by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) in India, we searched for pestivirus infection in yaks. Of 71 pure and crossbred yaks from Himalayan region, pestivirus antigen was detected by Ag-ELISA in three animals. Pestivirus in leukocyte and cell culture isolated virus samples originating from positive yaks was also confirmed by RT-PCR using panpestivirus specific primers selected from 5'-untranslated region (5' UTR). The 5' UTR, N(pro) and E2 regions were sequenced and used for genetic typing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that pestiviruses detected in three Himalayan yaks were similar genetically, belonging to BVDV-1. Antigenic characterisation of yak pestivirus also confirmed the typing as BVDV-1. This is the first report on the identification of BVDV type 1 in yaks.

      Together 381 sera of murine rodents (Apodemus flavicollis, Clethrionomys glareolus, Microtus arvalis and Mus musculus) trapped in different localities of Czechoslovakia were examined for the presence of antibodies to a murine alphaherpesvirus (MHV) and to murine cytomegalovirus (CMV). Positivity of rodent sera to the two MHV and one murine CMV strains varied from none to 12.5% and from none up to 11.3%, respectively, depending on the locality under study. From the lungs of A. flavicollis showing serum antibodies to MHV, a further murine herpes virus strain was isolated in rabbit embryo fibroblasts (REF). The latter MHV reached a titre of 10(10) TCID50/ml in the 13th passage, causing typical cytopathic effect from the 2nd passage on.

      During 1990 and 1991, adult mosquitoes were collected along the Ob River and its tributaries in western Siberia from approximately 51 degrees 18'N to 66 degrees 4'N. Fifteen virus strains were isolated from 74,196 mosquitoes tested in 1,874 pools. These included Tahyna virus from Aedes cataphylla-punctor subgroup (one) and Ae. excrucians (one), and Inkoo (INK) virus from Ae. communis (one), Ae. communis subgroup (one), Ae. hexodontus (two), Ae. punctor subgroup (two), Ae. punctor complex (one), and unidentified Aedes species (three). In addition, a single Ae. euedes yielded a strain of snowshoe hare (SSH) virus and a strain of Getah, an alphavirus. A Bunyamwera serogroup virus was isolated from Ae. excrucians. With the exception of the two isolates from a single mosquito, minimum infection rates among mosquito taxa ranged from 0.4 to 16.7 per 1,000. The INK virus isolates were widely distributed geographically; however, seven of the 10 isolates were from two sites north of the Arctic Circle. During 1991, sera from two mouse species, five vole species, and four shrew species were collected along the upper Ob River for serologic tests. The prevalence of neutralizing antibody to SSH virus in these sera was 80%. Prevalence rates in the four most abundant species were Apodemus agrarius, 73%; Clethrionomys rutilus, 71%; Microtus arvalis, 80%; and Sorex araneus, 91%. This is the first attempt to clarify the vector and vertebrate host relationships of California serogroup viruses in western Siberia.

      The determination of serologic titers to infectious organisms is a valuable tool for quantitating exposure to disease organisms. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) were live-trapped from September 1989 to October 1993 and samples collected from two distinct locations in west-central Illinois (USA); a state recreational facility (Park) and privately owned farming property (Farm). Sera were submitted for testing Leptospira interrogans (serovars bratislava, canicola, grippotyphosa, hardjo, icterohemmorhagiae, and pomona), canine distemper virus (CDV), pseudorabies virus (PV), and Toxoplasma gondii. Two-hundred and twenty-two (48%) of 459 raccoons were seropositive for L. interrogans. Eighty-five (23%) out of 368 raccoons were seropositive for canine distemper virus. Eighty-two (17%) of 479 raccoons raccoons were seropositive for pseudorabies virus. One hundred and eight-four (49%) of 379 raccoons were seropositive for T. gondii. A significant difference (P < 0.05) in seroprevalence for L. interrogans between the park (43%) and farm (52%) areas was found. A correlation between increasing age and seroprevalence was found for L. interrogans, CDV, PV, and T. gondii. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in seroprevalence for T. gondii during the spring trapping seasons (73%), when compared with the fall (33%). This type of information on exposure to infectious agents is important for developing control programs to manage raccoon-human and raccoon-domestic animals interactions.

      Pre-weaning diarrhoea is a well-known problem in mink farming in Europe, causing morbidity that varies between farms, regions and season. Different causalities for the disease have been proposed, but only most recently has a novel astrovirus been identified as an important risk factor. In this report, the molecular characterization, origin and evolution of this novel astrovirus of mink are discussed. The polyadenylated, positive-stranded RNA genome was sequenced and found to contain 6610 nt, organized into three ORFs and two short UTRs. A ribosomal frameshift sequence links the 5' two ORFs, containing sequence motifs for a serine protease (ORF1a) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (ORF1b). The structural proteins are encoded by ORF2 and, presumably, are expressed as a polyprotein precursor to be cleaved into the mature capsid proteins. These results indicate that mink astrovirus (MiAstV) has all of the features typical of members of the Astroviridae. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that MiAstV is distantly related to established astroviruses, showing less than 67 % similarity at the nucleotide level with its closest relative, ovine astrovirus, and even lower identities at the predicted amino acid level. Nevertheless, sequence analysis of MiAstV isolates from geographically distinct Swedish and Danish farms showed much less diversity. This suggests either the spread in the mink population of a virus that has evolved a long time ago or the recent introduction of an ancient virus into a new host species.

      This is the introductory paper to a series on the ecology of arboviruses in Argentina. Epizootics of equine encephalitis have occurred since at least 1908, principally in the Pampa and Espinal biogeographic zones, with significant economic losses; human cases of encephalitis have been rare or absent. Both western equine and eastern equine encephalitis viruses have been isolated from horses during these epizootics, but the mosquitoes responsible for transmission have not been identified. A number of isolations of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus were reported between 1936 and 1958 in Argentina, but the validity of these findings has been seriously questioned. Nevertheless, serological evidence exists for human infections with a member of the VEE virus complex. Serological surveys conducted in the 1960s indicate a high prevalence of infection of humans and domestic animals with St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), and 2 SLE virus strains have been isolated from rodents. Human disease, however, has rarely been associated with SLE infection. Only 7 isolations of other arboviruses have been described (3 of Maguari, 1 of Aura, 2 of Una, and 1 of an untyped Bunyamwera group virus). In 1977, we began longitudinal field studies in Santa Fe Province, the epicenter of previous equine epizootics, and in 1980 we extended these studies to Chaco and Corrientes provinces. The study sites are described in this paper.

      Allpahuayo virus was initially isolated from arboreal rice rats (Oecomys bicolor and Oecomys paricola) collected during 1997 at the Allpahuayo Biological Station in northeastern Peru. Serological and genetic studies identified the virus as a new member of the Tacaribe complex of the genus Arenavirus. The small (S) segment of the Allpahuayo virus prototype strain CLHP-2098 (Accession No. AY012686) was sequenced, as well as that of sympatric isolate CLHP-2472 (Accession No. AY012687), from the same rodent species. The S segment was 3382 bases in length and phylogenetic analysis indicated that Allpahuayo is a sister virus to Pichinde in clade A. Two ambisense, nonoverlapping reading frames were identified, which result in two predicted gene products, a glycoprotein precursor (GPC) and a nucleocapsid protein (NP). A predicted stable single hairpin secondary structure was identified in the intergenic region between GPC and NP. Details of the genetic organization of Allpahuayo virus are discussed.

Previously, full genome sequences of PEV-B had been reported from the United Kingdom, Hungary, and China. The Korean PEV-B isolate presented polyprotein gene nucleotide sequence similarities of 77.9, 73.7, 78.9, and 80.3%, respectively, to PEV-B UKG/410/73, LP54, PEV15, and Chinese strains (Ch-ah-f1).

      During the years 1964 to 1970, 171 arboviruses of 15 different types were isolated from humans in Nigeria. Isolation rates were highest in 1969, and lowest in 1965 and 1967. Monthly arbovirus activity was highest in the rainy season months of June, July and August and lowest in the dry months of January and February. Viruses were isolated from all age groups, with the majority from children one to four years old. The viruses isolated in largest numbers were chikungunya and yellow fever, which caused epidemics in 1969, and dengue types 1 and 2 and Tataguine, which are endemic in Ibadan. Bwamba virus was isolated in 1964 and 1969, and Bunyamwera group viruses were encountered for the first time in 1969. Other viruses recovered less frequently were Zika, Igbo-Ora (an agent related to o'nyong-nyong), two viruses related to the Uganda mosquito virus Ug MP 359, Dugbe, Thogoto, Lebombo and Shuni. Several of these are new agents and have not previously been isolated from man. Clinical details are presented where available.

      Swinepox virus infection results in an acute, mild or subclinical course and is characterised by typical poxvirus skin lesions in affected pigs. Additionally, sporadic vertical swinepox virus transmission leads to congenital generalised infection and subsequent abortion or stillbirth. The present report describes the occurrence of epidermal efflorescences in two piglets after intrauterine natural suipoxvirus infection. No clinical abnormalities of the gilt and littermates as well as in other pigs from this herd were present. One of the affected piglets was stillborn and submitted for necropsy, the other animal was alive at birth, but died 3 days later. Histologically, a proliferative to ulcerative dermatitis with epithelial ballooning degeneration and characteristic intracytoplasmatic inclusion bodies was observed. The pathomorphological and histopathological suspected diagnosis of a poxvirus infection was confirmed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, the agent was identified as suipoxvirus by polymerase chain reaction. As demonstrated here, obvious skin lesions in suipoxvirus infection leads to a suspected diagnosis in newborn piglets on macroscopic examination. However, further post mortem examinations, including electron microscopy as well as molecular techniques are essential for the identification of the aetiology and the exclusion of differential diagnoses. Because the disease only affected two pigs there was only a small economic loss. A valid diagnostic plays an important role in advising farmers and for herd health monitoring.

      Multiple beadlike fibromas have been observed in the lungs of European elks bearing cutaneous fibromas and fibropapillomas. DNA extracted from the lung fibromas was found to contain multiple copies of unintegrated European elk papillomavirus DNA, indicating an association between pulmonary fibromatosis and papillomavirus. No virus particles were observed in the tumor tissue by electron microscopy. Histological examination revealed that the lung fibromas had a morphology similar to that of cutaneous fibromas.

      Eight feeder swine (four to six months of age) were inoculated orally with 200,000 to 500,000 pig infectious doses (PID) of the Purdue strain of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus. Biopsies obtained from their small intestines were examined histopathologically and by fluorescent antibody tissue section technique at intervals that included 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours postexposure, and similar examinations were carried out at necropsy 168 hours postexposure. Evidence of virus infection was demonstrated in all segments of the small intestine except the upper duodenum and the viral antigen was found only in the cytoplasm of the absorptive cells covering the villi. Although six of the eight pigs failed to show clinical signs of TGE, typical microscopic lesions of villous atrophy with replacement of columnar absorptive cells by cuboidal cells were observed in seven pigs, and TGE virus antigen was demonstrated in the intestinal cells of four of eight pigs during the first week postexposure. The infection was usually mild to moderate and focal in the pigs without clinical signs of the disease and more severe and extensive in the pigs with clinical signs of the disease variable in severity. It was concluded that TGE virus probably replicated in all feeder swine exposed, and that the presence or absence of clinical signs of TGE in these pigs was related to the severity and extent of the villous atrophy and columnar cell replacement induced in their small intestines.

      A serosurvey was conducted during 1986-87 to determine evidence of prior Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) viral infection among camels imported into Egypt from Sudan and Kenya. Sera obtained from camesl arriving at the Aswan quarantine station, southern Egypt, were tested for CCHF antibody by the agar gel diffusion (AGD) and the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) techniques. CCHF viral antibody was demonstrated in 14% (600/4301) of the camels, with both techniques yielding similar results. CCHF viral antibody prevalence among camels imported from Sudan was lower (12%) than among camels imported from Kenya (26%). Ganjam and Qalyub viral antibody was not detected among the 600 CCHF viral antibody positive sera, but 7% (44/600) were positive for Dugbe viral antibody. CCHF viral antibody was not demonstrated in 400 sheep and 200 cows of native animals. These data indicate that camels imported from Sudan and Kenya had previous CCHF viral infection, but evidence of transmission to animals of Egypt was not obtained. Further studies are needed to assess the possible role of imported animals in the ecology and epidemiology of CCHF virus in Egypt.

      Fallow deer (Dama dama) were introduced to Little St. Simons Island, Georgia, USA in the 1920s and thrive at high population densities, to the exclusion of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginina). The presence of introduced pathogens and parasites as a result of their introduction is currently unknown, as is the impact of native disease on the exotic fallow deer. Hunter-killed fallow deer from 2003-2005 were necropsied and surveyed for evidence of infectious disease, parasitic agents, and toxicologic parameters. Fallow deer were positive for antibodies to bovine virus diarrhea virus I and II, bluetongue virus, and bovine adenovirus. Twenty species of bacteria were isolated from the internal organs, and 14 species of parasites were recovered including one abomasal nematode, Spiculopteragia asymmetrica, which is not known to occur in native North American ungulates. Concentrations of liver and copper were low, while lead, zinc, and iron were considered within normal levels. No clinical signs of disease were noted, and the overall health of the insular fallow deer was considered good.

      The life cycle of the Ebola (EBO) virus remains enigmatic. We tested for EBO virus in the organs of 242 small mammals captured during ecological studies in the Central African Republic. EBO virus glycoprotein or polymerase gene sequences were detected by reverse transcription PCR in RNA extracts of the organs of seven animals and by PCR in DNA extract of one animal. Neither live virus nor virus antigen was detected in any organ sample. Direct sequencing of amplicons identified the virus as being of the Zaire/Gabon subtype. Virus-like nucleocapsids were observed by electron microscopy in the cytoplasm of the spleen cells of one animal. The animals belonged to two genera of rodents (Muridae; Mus setulosus, Praomys sp1 and P. sp2) and one species of shrew (Soricidae; Sylvisorex ollula). These preliminary results provide evidence that common terrestrial small mammals living in peripheral forest areas have been in contact with the EBO virus and demonstrate the persistence of EBO virus RNA and DNA in the organs of the animals. Our findings should lead to better targeting of research into the life cycle of the EBO virus.

      Genetic analysis of virus detected in autopsy tissues of a fatal hantavirus pulmonary syndrome-like case in Louisiana revealed the presence of a previously unrecognized hantavirus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR fragments of the complete S and M segments of the virus amplified from RNA extracted from the tissues showed the virus to be novel, differing from the closest related hantavirus, Sin Nombre virus, by approximately 30%. Both genome segments were unique, and there was no evidence of genetic reassortment with previously characterized hantaviruses. The primary rodent reservoir of Sin Nombre virus, the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus, is absent from Louisiana. Thus, the virus detected in Louisiana, referred to here as Bayou virus, must possess a different rodent reservoir.

      A virus with characteristics similar to the pox group was isolated in tissue culture from bovine skin and oral lesions typical of pseudocowpox. The properties of this agent, certain of which differ from vaccinia virus, suggest that the isolate is the etiologic agent of the pseudocowpox syndrome.

      A virus (MnPV) with the structural characteristics of papilloma viruses was isolated from benign and malignant proliferations of adult animals of the inbred line 'GRA Giessen' of Mastomys natalensis. The particles can be banded in CsCl gradients at densities of 1.34 g/ml (full particles) and 1.29 g/ml (empty particles). The virus DNA has a buoyant density of 1.7104 g/ml and can exist in three different conformations (supercoiled circular, nicked circular and linear), the sedimentation values of which have been determined as 23 to 24S, 16 to 17S and 14 to 15S, respectively. Although the mol. wt. of MnPV DNA is similar to that of HPV 1 DNA, the size of the fragments obtained after cleavage of MnPV DNA with the restriction endonuclease Hae III is quite different from the pattern seen with human papilloma virus. The virion contains 12 different polypeptides; the major structural protein has a mol. wt. of 56 000. MnPV is shown to be the causative agent of the skin proliferations, because tumours can be induced by inoculation of purified virus, whereas no cutaneous alterations are observed when the particles are inoculated in the presence of anti-MnPV serum. MnPV can be re-isolated from the experimentally induced tumours.

      European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1, genotype 5) is known to endemically circulate in insectivorous bat populations in Germany. In August 2001, a rabies suspect stone marten (Martes foina) was found in the city of Burg (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) and was sent to the regional veterinary laboratory for routine rabies diagnosis. Whereas brain samples repeatedly tested negative in the fluorescent antibody test for classical rabies virus (genotype 1), the mouse inoculation test and the rabies tissue culture inoculation test yielded positive results. Rabies viral RNA was also detected in the stone marten brain sample both by nested and heminested RT-PCR specific for the nucleoprotein gene and for the nucleoprotein phosphoprotein junction of rabies virus. The amplification products were sequenced to genotype the isolate. Sequence data obtained from the first-round RT-PCR products were analysed and the suspect stone marten isolate was confirmed as a rabies related virus (EBLV-1a). Phylogenetic comparison with sequences from recent genotype five isolates from Germany and Denmark showed that it was closely related to a previous isolate of EBLV-1 from a serotine bat in Saxony-Anhalt obtained in the same year in an area adjacent to the place where the EBLV-1 infected stone marten was found. Both EBLV-1 isolates share a 99.5% identity. This is the first report of an EBLV-1a spill-over from an insectivorous bat into wildlife in Europe.

      Rabies in European bats was first reported in Germany in 1954. In concordance with Denmark and the Netherlands, Germany has reported one of the highest numbers (n = 187) of European bat lyssavirus (EBLV)-positive cases in bats in Europe so far (1954-2005). A combined descriptive epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis on bat rabies and prevailing EBLVs is presented, comprising the past 50 years. So far, only the two lineages of EBLV-1 (genotype 5), a and b, have been detected. Although only 50% of the rabies-positive bats have been identified by species, the Serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus) is the bat species most frequently infected. Single rabies cases have also been detected in a further five indigenous bat species. There is proven evidence for a substantial bias in the frequency of bat rabies cases in the north of Germany, with an endemic cluster in the northwesternmost low-lying plain areas adjacent to the Netherlands and Denmark. Improvements to bat rabies surveillance and research are discussed.

      A 3-yr-old female Flemish Giant pet rabbit developed a papilloma on the right nictitating membrane. Although the papilloma was excised surgically, it promptly recurred. Examination of the eye 10 wk after surgery revealed that in addition to the initial mass, 2 smaller papillomas were present on the lower eyelid. All 3 masses were excised, and histology revealed papillomatous hyperplasia of the conjunctival epithelium, koilocytosis, and intranuclear viral inclusions. Polymerase chain reaction amplified papillomaviral DNA from the largest papilloma. Sequencing of the amplicon revealed 99.3% homology with rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV). All 3 masses recurred after removal. In addition, the rabbit was noted to be losing weight. Weight loss continued until the rabbit died 3 mo later. All 3 papillomas persisted until death. This article provides the fi rst description of ROPV causing conjunctival papillomas and is the fi rst report of ROPV from the southern hemisphere. The persistence of the papillomas in this case is also unusual and may suggest that ROPV-induced conjunctival papillomas are less likely than oral papillomas to spontaneously regress. Alternatively, the death of this rabbit may indicate a compromised immune system that allowed papillomaviral persistence.

      Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) in captivity have unusually high morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, a trait that could be an outcome of population homogeneity or the immunomodulating effects of chronic stress. Free-ranging Namibian cheetahs share ancestry with captive cheetahs, but their susceptibility to infectious diseases has not been investigated. The largest remaining population of free-ranging cheetahs resides on Namibian farmlands, where they share habitat with domestic dogs and cats known to carry viruses that affect cheetah health. To assess the extent to which free-ranging cheetahs are exposed to feline and canine viruses, sera from 81 free-ranging cheetahs sampled between 1992 and 1998 were evaluated for antibodies against canine distemper virus (CDV), feline coronavirus (feline infectious peritonitis virus; FCoV/ FIPV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV1), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline calicivirus (FCV) and for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigens. Antibodies against CDV, FCoV/FIPV, FHV1, FPV, and FCV were detected in 24, 29, 12, 48, and 65% of the free-ranging population, respectively, although no evidence of viral disease was present in any animal at the time of sample collection. Neither FIV antibodies nor FeLV antigens were present in any free-ranging cheetah tested. Temporal variation in FCoV/FIPV seroprevalence during the study period suggested that this virus is not endemic in the free-ranging population. Antibodies against CDV were detected in cheetahs of all ages sampled between 1995 and 1998, suggesting the occurrence of an epidemic in Namibia during the time when CDV swept through other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. This evidence in free-ranging Namibian cheetahs of exposure to viruses that cause severe disease in captive cheetahs should direct future guidelines for translocations, including quarantine of seropositive cheetahs and preventing contact between cheetahs and domestic pets.

      Although rabies outbreaks in most parts of the world tend to be host species-specific the rabies currently enzootic in the Canadian province of Ontario is hosted by two wildlife species, the red fox and the striped skunk. Previous studies employing monoclonal antibody panels failed to identify any host-specific differences in Ontario rabies virus street isolates, but certain observations suggested the existence of more than one viral strain in terrestrial mammals of this region. The extent of variation of the rabies virus circulating within this region has been re-examined using molecular biology techniques. The N gene of several independent isolates was amplified using PCR and the resulting products were compared by restriction enzyme analysis and, in some cases, by DNA sequencing. This analysis confirmed that there was indeed no host-specific variation in the portion of the viral genome under study but there were, however, very clear and consistent differences in the virus from distinct geographical regions.

      Antigenic characterisation of over 350 chiropteran rabies viruses of the Americas, especially from species reported rabid in Canada, distinguished 13 viral types. In close accord with this classification, nucleotide sequencing of representative isolates, at both the N and G loci, identified four principal phylogenetic groups (I-IV), sub-groups of which circulated in particular bat species. Amongst the North American bat viruses, there was a notable division between group I specimens associated with colonial, non-migratory bats (Myotis sp. and Eptesicus fuscus) and those of group II harbored by solitary, migratory species (Lasiurus sp. and Lasionycteris noctivagans). Certain species of Myotis were clearly identified as rabies reservoirs, an observation often obscured previously by their frequent infection by viral variants of other chiroptera. An additional group (III) apparently circulates in E. fuscus, whilst viruses harbored by both insectivorous and haematophagus bats of Latin America clustered to a separate clade (group IV). Comparison of the predicted N and G proteins of these viruses with those of strains of terrestrial mammals indicated a similarity in structural organisation regardless of host species lifestyle. Finally, these sequences permitted examination of the evolutionary relationship of American bat rabies viruses within the Lyssavirus genus.

      Rabies virus exists in dogs on Sri Lanka as a single, minimally divergent lineage only distantly related to other rabies virus lineages in Asia. Stable, geographically isolated virus populations are susceptible to local extinction. A fully implemented rabies-control campaign could make Sri Lanka the first Asian country in >30 years to become free of rabies virus.

      Natural infection of feral Indian rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) by a new simian beta retrovirus, provisionally called simian retrovirus-7 (SRV-7) is described. The virus is capable of in vitro replication in primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and B and T cell lines. We have earlier reported a novel SRV, SRV-6 from Indian langurs (Semnopithecus entellus). Additional sequence analyses from gp20 transmembrane (TM) env genes of SRV-6 and SRV-7 place them in a separate cluster, related to but distinct from known exogenous SRVs and also close to the simian endogenous beta retrovirus, (SERV) from African baboon. Phylogenetic analyses of pol gene of SRV-7 place it closer to SERV when the stop codons of the SERV genes are removed. On the other hand, additional sequence data from gp70, surface glycoprotein (SU) region of the env gene of SRV-6 suggest it is more closely related to known exogenous SRVs, (SRV-1 to 3). It is also related to the endogenous langur virus, Po-1-Lu. We hypothesize that SRV-6 and SRV-7 probably originated from a progenitor exogenous SRV which recombined with an endogenous SERV in the TM env and pol genes during evolution, based on the phylogenetic analyses.

      BPV-1 DNA is the predominant viral type detected in equine sarcoids and represents the only reported natural cross species infection of papillomaviruses. In this study, nucleotide variations in the LCR and the E2 regions of equine sarcoid-associated BPV-1 were characterised by sequence analysis. Variants particular to sarcoid BPV-1 were identified in both the LCR and E2 sequence. The functionality of the most common LCR variant was examined in equine and bovine cells. These studies showed that the activity of the variant LCR was higher in equine cells than bovine cells; the activity of the variant LCR in the presence of the E2 variant was similar to the reference/wild-type sequences in equine cells, whereas in bovine cells the variant function was reduced by 50%. These data suggest the viral BPV variants commonly detected in sarcoids have an enhanced function in equine cells compared to their function in bovine cells.

      Five years after the apparent end of the major 1995 Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) epizootic/epidemic, focal outbreaks of equine encephalitis occurred in Carabobo and Barinas States of western Venezuela. Virus isolates from horses in each location were nearly identical in sequence to 1995 isolates, which suggests natural persistence of subtype IC VEE virus (VEEV) strains in a genetically stable mode. Serologic evidence indicated that additional outbreaks occurred in Barinas State in 2003. Field studies identified known Culex (Melanoconion) spp. vectors and reservoir hosts of enzootic VEEV but a dearth of typical epidemic vectors. Cattle serosurveys indicated the recent circulation of enzootic VEEV strains, and possibly of epizootic strains. Persistence of VEEV subtype IC strains and infection of horses at the end of the rainy season suggest the possibility of an alternative, cryptic transmission cycle involving survival through the dry season of infected vectors or persistently infected vertebrates.

      Relative to the developed world, rabies has been poorly studied in the vast African continent. The southern African countries of Zimbabwe and South Africa, however, are known to sustain a great diversity of lyssaviruses, with large biological variations amongst genotype 1 (rabies viruses) at present more apparent here than elsewhere on the continent. One recognized biotype of rabies virus in the subcontinent appears to be specifically adapted to a variety of mongooses, belonging to the Viverrinae subfamily (family Herpestidae) and are commonly referred to as viverrid viruses, although the term mongoose rabies would be more correct, considering the taxonomic status of the host species involved. It was our objective to study the genetic relationships of 77 rabies virus isolates of this mongoose biotype, isolated in South Africa and Zimbabwe, towards elucidation of the molecular epidemiology of this interesting group of African viruses. In our study of a 592 nucleotide sequence encompassing the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein and the G-L intergenic region of the viral genomes, we provide the first comprehensive data on the molecular epidemiology of these viruses and indicate a history of extended evolutionary adaptation in this geographical domain. The molecular epidemiological observations reported here are highly unlikely to be limited to the small geographical areas of South Africa and Zimbabwe and illustrate the need for lyssavirus surveillance in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa and throughout the entire continent.

      Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) viruses are pestiviruses that have been isolated from domestic and wild ruminants. There is serologic evidence of pestiviral infection in more than 40 species of free-range and captive mammals. Vertical transmission can produce persistently infected animals that are immunotolerant to the infecting strain of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and shed virus throughout their lives. Seven species (white-tailed deer, mouse deer, eland, domestic cattle, alpaca, sheep, and pigs) have been definitively identified as persistently infected with BVDV. This study provides serological, molecular, immunohistochemical, and histological evidence for BVDV infection in 2 captive mountain goats from a zoological park in Idaho. The study was triggered by isolation of BVDV from tissues and immunohistochemical identification of viral antigen within lesions of a 7-month-old male mountain goat (goat 1). Blood was collected from other mountain goats and white-tailed and mule deer on the premises for BVDV serum neutralization, viral isolation, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. One 3-month-old mountain goat (goat 2) was antibody negative and BVDV positive in serum samples collected 3 months apart. This goat subsequently died, and though still antibody negative, BVDV was isolated from tissues and identified by immunohistochemistry within lesions. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis identified the isolates as BVDV-2. These findings provide evidence of persistent infection in a mountain goat, underscoring the need for pestivirus control strategies for wild ruminants in zoological collections.

      A serological survey for human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)/simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) antibodies was performed in 102 wild-caught monkeys and apes from 15 (sub)species originating from Cameroon. Two animals (a Mandrillus sphinx and a Cercocebus agilis) exhibited a complete HTLV-1 seroreactivity pattern while two others lacked either the p24 (a Mandrillus sphinx) or the MTA-1/gp46 bands (a Pan troglodytes). Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses, using a 522 bp env gene fragment and the complete LTR, indicated that the two mandrill STLV strains belonged to the HTLV/STLV subtype D clade while the chimpanzee strain clustered in the HTLV/STLV subtype B clade. The Cercocebus agilis STLV strain, the first one found in this species, was closely related to the two HTLV/STLV subtype F strains. Such data indicate that the African biodiversity of STLV-1 in the wild is far from being known and reinforces the hypothesis of interspecies transmission of STLV-1 from monkeys and apes to humans leading to the present day distribution of HTLV-1 in African inhabitants.

      A B-lymphoid cell line was established from a normal gorilla. The cells contained Epstein-Barr virus-related antigens, and herpesvirus particles were demonstrated by electron microscopy. DNA-DNA reassociation kinétics revealed 30 to 40% hybridization to Epstein-Barr virus with 50 genomes per cell. Examination of the viral nuclear antigen with gorilla sera showed this to be a unique isolate termed Herpesvirus gorilla. H. gorilla transformed gibbon B-lymphocytes in vitro.

      Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3) infections cause considerable morbidity and mortality after stem cell transplantation, and inpatient nosocomial outbreaks are common. From September 1998 to July 1999, 93 stem cell transplantation recipients at our institution contracted hPIV3, of which 66 (71%) were being followed up in our outpatient department (OPD). The peak incidence was in September and October, when 39 cases were identified; thereafter, hPIV3 incidence decreased to approximately 5 cases per month. Nucleotide sequences (778 nucleotides from variable regions of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene) from 46 patient and 8 community hPIV3 isolates were compared to determine epidemiologic relatedness. Sequence analysis of OPD isolates revealed that 18 of 19 isolates from September and October and 11 of 15 isolates from November 1998 to July 1999 were genetically similar. In contrast, 2 of 3 community isolates from September and October and 0 of 5 from November to July were linked to this cluster. Symptomatic surveillance and isolation were ineffective in terminating the outbreak, suggesting asymptomatic shedding among patients, staff, or visitors or viral persistence on environmental surfaces as possible explanations. The concept of nosocomial transmission should be expanded to include the OPD for immunosuppressed patients.

      Sandfly fever viruses are transmitted by the bite of phlebotomine sandflies; serotypes sandfly fever Naples virus, sandfly fever Sicilian virus and sandfly fever Cyprus virus cause febrile illness, whereas Toscana virus (TOSV) may cause neuroinvasive infections. Although TOSV is an important cause of aseptic meningitis in central and southern Italy, in many cases the infection is asymptomatic, leading to underestimation of the actual spread of the virus. This serosurvey aimed to assess the seroprevalence of TOSV in a random population in Siena (Tuscany, central Italy) in 2003-2004 and 2013-2014 and Bari (Apulia, southern Italy) in 2004 and 2015. 2132 serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-TOSV/SFNV IgG by means of ELISA and IFA commercial tests. Seroprevalence rates were compared in the two cities and over a ten-year period in the same city. Seroprevalence results in the Siena population (22.95% in 2003-2004 vs 26.75% in 2013-2014) confirmed the endemic circulation of TOSV and closely related viruses in central Italy, without major changes over the last decade, while no significant prevalence was observed in Bari (2.90% in 2004 vs 1.85% in 2015).

      Ljungan virus (LV) has recently been associated with perinatal death in its natural rodent reservoir and also with developmental disorders of reproduction in laboratory mice. A strong epidemiological association has been found between small rodent abundance in Sweden and the incidence of intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) in humans. LV antigen has been detected in half of the IUFD cases tested. The question was therefore raised whether sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) might be associated with rodent abundance, and whether the virus is present in cases of SIDS. Variation in the incidence of SIDS using the Swedish cause-of-death database tracked the changes in the population fluctuations of native rodents. Formalin-fixed tissues from the brain, heart, and lung were investigated from cases of SIDS, SIDS with lymphocytic infiltration of the myocardium (myocarditis) and myocarditis cases using LV specific immunohistochemistry (IHC). Ljungan virus was detected in the brain, heart, and lung tissue from all three of the patient categories investigated using IHC. These studies suggest that LV may play a prominent role in infant death, and that IUFD and SIDS may have common etiological underpinnings.

      A previously unknown picornavirus was isolated from bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus). Electron microscopy images and sequence data of the prototype isolate, named Ljungan virus, showed that it is a picornavirus. The amino acid sequences of predicted Ljungan virus capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 were closely related to the human pathogen echovirus 22 (approximately 70% similarity). A partial 5' noncoding region sequence of Ljungan virus showed the highest degree of relatedness to cardioviruses. Two additional isolates were serologically and molecularly related to the prototype.

      Preliminary serological investigations were prefered to detect evidence of arenavirus infection in rodents. The study examined virus antibody in 367 rodents trapped in 6 different geographical areas of Nakhon Pathom Province, Thailand from February-March, 1998. The overall seroprevalence among rodents was 13.3%, mostly in Bandicota savilei (35.7%) and Rattus norvegicus (31.5%). Between ecology, behavior and sex of the rodents, seroprevalence was not significantly different (p>0.05), however the seroprevalence found among different geographical areas of Nakhon Pathom Province were significantly different (p<0.0001).

      An ungulate research facility in Fort Collins, Colorado, U.S.A., experienced mortality in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) because of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) infection from 20 August 2007 through 26 September 2007. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) was detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and virus isolation from the spleen and lung tissues of two white-tailed deer. Virus neutralization tests were performed on pre- and postoutbreak sera from other species maintained in the same facility, including bison (Bison bison), elk (Cervus elaphus), domestic cattle (Bos taurus), and domestic goats (Capra hircus), as well as postoutbreak sera from the surviving white-tailed deer. Serum samples that represented all species in the facility neutralized EHDV-1 and EHDV-2 either before or after the outbreak. The animals that neutralized EHDV-1 did not neutralize EHDV-2. No clinical signs attributable to EHDV infection were noted in any of the species other than the deer during the outbreak. Although experimental EHDV infections have been reported in bison and elk, natural exposures have not been previously documented in these species in North America. The roles that elk, bison, cattle, and goats might play in the epidemiology of EHDV in a close-contact multispecies situation remain unknown.

      Two bighorn sheep from Arizona (USA) were submitted for necropsy. One was a Rocky Mountain bighorn (Ovis canadensis canadensis) and the other was a desert bighorn (Ovis canadensis mexicana). Both had lesions consistent with those of hemorrhagic disease (HD). Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) type-2 and bluetongue virus (BTV) type-17, respectively, were isolated from the sheep tissues. To our knowledge, HD caused by either EHDV or BTV infection has not been documented previously in Arizona bighorn sheep.

      Although transmission of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) variants to nonhuman primates is well documented, it remains to be elucidated whether nonhuman primate HBV is transmissible to humans. The prevalence and transmission routes of gibbon HBV were analysed in 101 captive gibbons in Thailand. Approximately 40 % of these animals showed at least one marker of HBV infection; 19 animals were chronic HBV carriers, characterized by elevated levels of alanine amino transferase and the presence of HBV DNA. Some of the chronic animals were found to be anti-HBc (HBV core antigen) negative (4 of 19), while precore promoter point mutations (nt 1762 or 1764) were determined in four animals by RFLP analysis. Phylogenetic tree analysis of the complete surface gene sequences revealed that gibbon viruses clustered separately from hepadnaviruses of other hosts. Evidence for horizontal and vertical transmission in captive gibbons was obtained. HBV DNA was also detected in the saliva of HBV carrier gibbons. Although some of the animal caretakers at the Krabok Koo Wildlife Breeding Centre were found to be chronic HBV carriers, genotype and sequence analysis did not reveal any evidence for zoonotic disease transmission.

      We describe here serological and structural properties of a virus, Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus (M-PMV), isolated from a simian mammary tumor. This virus is morphologically similar to the known oncogenic RNA viruses (oncornaviruses). It has a 60-70S RNA, and its replication is inhibited by actinomycin. Antisera prepared against the virus isolated by density-gradient centrifugation identify at least two viral structural antigens. Immunodiffusion studies show that this virus is serologically unrelated to three types of simian foamy viruses, visna virus, and the known oncornaviruses. Immunofluorescence reveals that the structural proteins of the virus are synthesized cytoplasmically. Although M-PMV productively infects human cells in vitro, serological analysis does not show the presence of M-PMV antigens in human neoplasia.

      To date, no molecular studies on group C viruses (Bunyaviridae, Orthobunyavirus) have been published. We determined the complete small RNA (SRNA) segment and partial medium RNA segment nucleotide sequences for 13 group C members. The full-length SRNA sequences ranged from 915 to 926 nucleotides in length, and revealed similar organization in comparison with other orthobunyaviruses. Based on the 705 nucleotides of the N gene, group C members were distributed into three major phylogenetic groups, with the exception of Madrid virus, which was placed outside of these three groups. Analysis of the Caraparu virus strain BeH 5546 revealed that it has an SRNA sequence nearly identical to that of Oriboca virus and is a natural reassortant virus. In addition, analysis of 345 nucleotides of the Gn gene for eight group C viruses and for strain BeH 5546 revealed a different phylogenetic topology, suggesting a reassortment pattern among them. These findings represent the first evidence for natural reassortment among the group C viruses, which include several human pathogens. Furthermore, our genetic data corroborate previous relationships determined using serologic assays (complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, and neutralization tests) and suggest that a combination of informative molecular, serological, and ecological data is a helpful tool to understand the molecular epidemiology of arboviruses.

      Serologic testing revealed that 17/84 (20.2%) of bought-in Aotus and 1/31 (3.2%) of colony-born Aotus had haemagglutination-inhibition antibody. Clinically-inapparent measles infections were detected in 3 monkeys by increased antibody titres. Following the detection of a recent infection, antibody titre persisted at a high level for at least 240 days. Although 84% of the monkeys were sero-susceptible, no further serological evidence of measles infection occurred.

      Etiologic studies of acute febrile disease were conducted in sites across South America, including Cusco and Iquitos, Peru. Patients' clinical signs and symptoms were recorded, and acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples were obtained for serologic examination and virus isolation in Vero E6 and C6/36 cells. Virus isolated in Vero E6 cells was identified as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) by electron microscopy and by subsequent molecular diagnostic testing of samples from 2 febrile patients with nausea, headache, and dyspnea. The virus was recovered from acute-phase serum samples from both case-patients and identified with cardiovirus-specific reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing. Serum samples from case-patient 1 showed cardiovirus antibody by immunoglobulin M ELISA (acute phase <8, convalescent phase >1,024) and by neutralization assay (acute phase <10, convalescent phase >1,280). Serum samples from case-patient 2 did not contain antibodies detectable by either assay. Detection of virus in serum strongly supports a role for EMCV in human infection and febrile illness.

      The species Human enterovirus A (HEV-A) in the family Picornaviridae consists of coxsackieviruses (CV) A2-A8, A10, A12, A14 and A16 and enterovirus 71. Complete genome sequences for the prototype strains of the 10 serotypes whose sequences were not represented in public databases have been determined and analysed in conjunction with previously available complete sequences in GenBank. Members of HEV-A are monophyletic relative to all other human enterovirus species in all regions of the genome except in the 5' non-translated region (NTR), where they are known to cluster with members of HEV-B. The HEV-A prototype strains were about 66 to 86 % identical to one another in deduced capsid amino acid sequence. Antigenic cross-reactivity has been reported between CVA3-Olson and CVA8-Donovan, between CVA5-Swartz and CVA12-Texas-12 and between CVA16-G-10 and EV71-BrCr. Similarity plots, individual sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses demonstrate a high degree of capsid sequence similarity within each of these three pairs of prototype strains, providing a molecular basis for the observed antigenic relationships. In several cases, phylogenies constructed from the structural (P1) and non-structural regions of the genome (P2 and P3) are incongruent. The incongruent phylogenies and the similarity plot analyses imply that recombination has played a role in the evolution of the HEV-A prototype strains. CVA6-Gdula clearly contains sequences that are also present in CVA10-Kowalik and CVA12-Texas-12, suggesting that these three strains have a shared evolutionary history despite their lack of similarity in the capsid region.

      Small wild vertebrates were trapped during an investigation into possible vertebrate reservoirs of o'nyong-nyong (ONN) fever virus in Uganda in 1997. Antibody neutralization test results and virus isolation attempts were negative for ONN virus, confirming the work of earlier investigators, who also failed to find evidence for a nonhuman ONN virus reservoir. In the course of these ONN virus studies, Thogoto virus was isolated from one of eight banded mongooses (Mongos mungo). This is the first isolation of Thogoto virus from a wild vertebrate. Neutralizing antibodies to Thogoto virus were also found in two of the other mongooses.

      We analysed genogroups of four feline calcivirus (FCV) isolates (FCV-S, H10, Ao198-1 and ML89) obtained from cats that experienced FCV infection after having been vaccinated against FCV. New PCR primer sets (8F/8R, Ao-S/Ao-A, cp-S/cp-A) were also designed, since the conventional Seal primer failed to amplify the target sequences in two samples. The genogroups of the four isolates as well as eight global and 17 domestic strains were determined by phylogenetic analysis of their amino acid sequences. One out of the four strains (25%) isolated in this study, H10, was grouped into genogroup I, along with the vaccine strains F9 and FCV-255. The other three isolates (75%) belonged to genogroup II. Thus, there were more isolates in genogroup II than in genogroup I. However, the antibody values of the four isolates against cat anti-F9 antisera were significantly decreased. There may be no relationship between the neutralizing antibody titre and genogroup. Amino acid sequence alignment of the four isolates showed that only a single amino acid in region C, which is involved in neutralization epitopes, was different in ML89 strain from that of F9. The other three strains, H10, Ao198-1 and FCV-B, shared the same amino acid sequence with F9. Alignment of amino acids for linear epitopes in the F9 strain, which are located at regions D and E, showed variations in 5' hypervariable region (HVR) of E, whereas D and conE had only synonymous substitutions i.e. no change in the amino acid sequence. This mutation in 5' HVR of region E suggested a vaccine breakdown, as the region is known to be essential for antigenicity. The genogroup II FCV is likely to be the cause of the FCV infection in this study, while the vaccine strains belong to genogroup I. Thus, the existing vaccine may need reevaluation for its effectiveness.

      Antibodies to influenza A virus were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the sera from two of seven Baikal seals (Phoca sibrica) and from five of six ringed seals (Phoca hispida) in Russia. In a hemagglutination-inhibition test using H1-H15 reference influenza A viruses, ELISA-positive sera from one Baikal seal and four ringed seals reacted to A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) and A/Bangkok/1/79 (H3N2) strains. One ringed seal serum sample reacted to A/seal/Massachusetts/1/80 (H7N7). The present results suggested that human-related H3 viruses were prevalent in Baikal seals and ringed seals inhabiting the central Russian Arctic.

      Although cardioviruses related to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) appear to be common in mice and rats, few TMEV isolates have been obtained from rat colonies. In 1991, a cardiovirus isolate designated NGS910 was obtained from sentinel rats exposed to cage bedding previously used by adult rats that were TMEV seropositive, but had never manifested clinical signs of disease. To determine to which group and subgroup of cardiovirus this virus belongs, the sequence of the viral genome was determined. The NGS910 genome consisted of 8,021 nucleotides and the 5'-nontranslated region had a predicted secondary structure that is similar to members of the TMEV group of cardioviruses. The Leader-P3D open reading frame (L ORF) of NGS910 had strong homology with L ORFs of other TMEVs (72% identity), but lower homology with EMCV cardioviruses (55 to 56%). Phylogenetic analyses on the basis of aligned nucleotide sequences of the L ORF (6,924 b) and the internal L* ORF (471 b) supported this classification of NGS910 as a TMEV strain. However, within the TMEV group, NGS910 wassufficiently divergent from other isolates that it could not be regarded as simply a mutant strain of a known TMEV. As genetic distances between NGS910 and other TMEVs were greater than those between Mengo virus of EMCV and other EMCVs, we propose to designate the NGS910 isolate as a rat Theiler-like virus.

      Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are a major cause of acute dehydrating diarrhea in infants and young animals worldwide. RVAs have also been detected in several wild and zoo animals, indicating wide susceptibility of wild animals. However, the role of wild animals in the infection cycle of RVAs is unclear. Wild boars are indigenous in many countries in the world. Japanese wild boars (Sus scrofa leucomystax) have been migrating close to human habitats in Japan, indicating the possibility of natural transmission between domestic animals or humans and wild boars. We investigated infection of RVAs in wild boars in Japan to identify types of RVAs infecting wild animals. We obtained stool samples from 90 wild boars and detected a VP4 gene of RVAs by RT-semi-nested PCR. RVAs were detected in samples from four of the 90 wild boars. Nucleotide analyses of VP7 and VP4 genes revealed that the four strains belong to G9P[23], G4P[23], G9P[13] and G4P[6], suggesting a relation to porcine and human RVAs. We therefore characterized RVAs circulating among domestic pigs living in the same area as the wild boars. We collected stool samples from 82 domestic pigs. RVAs were detected in samples from 49 of the 82 domestic pigs. Phylogenetic and similarity analyses provided evidence for natural transmission between domestic pigs and wild boars. The results also suggested that natural reassortment events occurred before or after transmission between domestic pigs and wild boars. Our findings indicate the possibility that RVAs circulate among wild animals, humans and domestic animals in nature.

      By means of polymerase chain reaction with a primer pair (NG133-NG147) deduced from the untranslated region (UTR) of TT virus (TTV), TTVs with markedly distinct genomic lengths were recovered from sera of humans and nonhuman primates, and their entire nucleotide sequences were determined. A human TTV [TGP96 of 2908 nucleotides (nt)] was obtained that was about 900 nt shorter than heretofore reported TTVs (3787-3853 nt). Likewise, TTVs of chimpanzee occurred in two distinct genomic sizes [Pt-TTV6 (3690 nt) and Pt-TTV8-II (2785 nt)]. Two TTVs of Japanese macaque [Mf-TTV3 (3798 nt) and Mf-TTV9 (3763 nt)] were comparable in genomic length, but only 55% similar in sequence. These five human and nonhuman primate TTVs, along with TTVs of tamarin [So-TTV2 (3371 nt)] and douroucouli [At-TTV3 (3718 nt)], were compared over the entire nucleotide sequence. Although the seven TTVs were only < or = 55% similar, they share a common genomic organization with two open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF1 (654-735 amino acids) and ORF2 (91-152 amino acids). The N-terminal sequences of ORF1 proteins were rich in arginine, and sequence motifs necessary for transcription and replication were conserved among them all. Like the human prototype TTV (TA278), all seven TTVs from various animals possessed in common two 15-nt sequences (CGAATGGCTGAGTTT and AGGGGCAATTCGGGC) in the UTR that were covered by NG133 and NG147, respectively. These primers would be instrumental in research on TTVs in previously unexamined species for defining their virological characteristics and evolutionary relationships.

      A nonenveloped, single-stranded, and circular DNA virus designated TT virus (TTV) has been reported in association with hepatitis of unknown etiology. TTV has a wide sequence divergence (approximately 52%), by which it is classified into at least 16 genotypes separated by an evolutionary distance of >0.30. Therefore, the detection of TTV DNA by polymerase chain reaction would be influenced by primers deduced from conserved or divergent regions of the genome. Of the 30 sera from healthy individuals, up to 17% tested positive with primers deduced from coding region, much less frequently than up to 93% testing positive with primers from noncoding region. These differences were not attributable to the sensitivity of detection, because a cloned TTV DNA of genotype 1a was detected sensitively (up to 1 copy per test) with primers deduced from either the coding or the noncoding region of the same genotype. Sera testing positive only with noncoding region primers, or those showing higher titers with noncoding than coding region primers, contained TTV DNA strains with sequence divergence of 47-53% from the TA278 isolate of genotype 1a within the N22 region spanning 222-231 nucleotides. Some of the sera contained two or three TTV DNA strains of distinct genotypes. These results indicate TTV strains with extremely high sequence divergence prevailing in healthy individuals and frequent mixed infection with TTV strains of distinct genotypes.

      Serum samples collected from 224 tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) in two captive populations in urban areas in eastern New South Wales Australia, between December 1999 and May 2004, were tested for antibodies to Ross River virus (RRV). In one population in northwest Sydney, 21 animals (11%) tested positive, and in another population in Newcastle, New South Wales, thirteen (33%) of the animals were positive. Antibodies were detected in four of 11 wallaroos (Macropus robustus) (36%) but not in parma wallabies (Macropus parma) (n=5), koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) (n=12) and southern hairy-nosed wombats (Lasiorhinus latifrons) (n=2) from the Sydney area. These data support the possible role of marsupials as urban amplifying hosts for RRV.

      We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of an infectious proviral molecular clone (FIV-14) of the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). FIV-14 has a genome organization similar in complexity to other lentiviruses. In addition to three large open reading frames representing the gag, pol, and env genes, at least four small open reading frames are present in the pol-env intergenic, env, and env-3' long terminal repeat regions. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence alignments of the FIV coding sequences with analogous sequences of other lentiviruses revealed significant identities only in the gag and pol genes. Phylogenetic tree analyses of gag and pol gene-encoded protein sequences demonstrate that FIV is more closely related to the ungulate lentiviruses, equine infectious anemia virus and visna virus, than to the primate lentiviruses, human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.

      A dairy goat operation in Minnesota experienced a sudden, markedly increased mortality among its neonatal goats. Approximately 60 of 130 kids (46%) died. The animals had diarrhea and dyspnea of 1-2 days duration before death. Necropsy of 4 goat kids revealed marked, acute, catarrhal enteritis and fibrinous pleuropneumonia. Mannheimia haemolytica was isolated from the lungs. Basophilic inclusion bodies filling the entire nucleus were present in enterocytes of the ileum of 3 goats. Adenoviral particles were detected in the feces by electron microscopy and adenovirus was subsequently isolated from the intestinal content together with a parvo-like virus (dependovirus). Morphology, physicochemical characteristics, and neutralization tests indicated that the adenovirus resembled ovine adenovirus-2 (OAdV-2). However, the PstI restriction endonuclease pattern produced by the goat adenovirus was distinct from that of OAdV-2. This is the first report of enteritis in goats with an adenovirus antigenically related to OAdV-2 and with a parvo-like dependovirus.

      Sera were collected from humans, cattle, horses, goats, ducks, chickens, wild birds, bats and rats in Lombok, Indonesia, and were tested by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) for antibodies to JE, ZIKA, CHIK and RR. Selected sera were tested by microneutralization tests for antibodies to the following viruses: JE, ZIKA, MVE, TMU, LGT, KUN, SEP, DEN-2, CHIK, RR, GET, SIN, BUN, BAT and BAK. Human sera had JE HI antibody in 135 (30%) of 446 tested. Neutralization tests indicated that DEN-2, ZIKA, TMU, KUN and SEP may have caused flavivirus infections. Antibodies to other arboviruses tested for were not found. HI and neutralization tests on animal sera indicated possible flavivirus infections with JE, MVE, KUN and SEP, and also that infections with BAT and BUN had occurred among domestic animals. No neutralizing antibodies were found for alphaviruses or other viruses used in the tests.

      Co-infection of parvovirus B19 with hepatitis B virus has been found in patients with acute and chronic hepatitis. The clinical significance of parvovirus B19 in hepatitis B co-infected patients is still controversial. In this study parvovirus B19 antibodies and DNA were investigated in serum samples from 76 patients with HBV infection, 17 with HBV/HCV co-infection and 44 healthy controls. In the sera from patients with HBV infection, anti-B19V IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in 24/76 (32%) and 25/76 (33%), in 6/17 (35%) and 8/17 (47%) of HBV/HCV co-infected patients, and in 14/44 (32%) and 12/44 (12%) of a non-hepatitis healthy controls, respectively. B19V DNA was detected in 8/76 (11%) of patients with HBV infection and in 3/17 (18%) of patients with a HBV/HCV co-infection, and in 4/44 (9%) healthy controls. The occurrence of parvovirus B19 DNA was significantly higher in patients with symptomatic HBV 4/20 (20%) compared to asymptomatic HBV carrier 4/56 (7%) (P<0.05). Ten of the positive B19V DNA sequences belonged to B19V genotype 1 while two belonged to genotype 3. The results of this study showed a significant difference in the prevalence of parvovirus B19 DNA in symptomatic HBsAg positive as compared to asymptomatic HBsAg positive individuals; however, the conclusion that parvovirus B19 infection increased the frequency of liver disease was not supported. Long-term longitudinal studies are, however, required to determine the synergistic effect of parvovirus B19 infection in HBV or HBV and HCV co-infected persons.

      A virus isolated from dead Chaerephon plicata bats collected near Kampot, Cambodia, was identified as a member of the family Bunyaviridae by electron microscopy. The only bunyavirus previously isolated from Chaerephon species bats in South-East Asia is Kaeng Khoi (KK) virus (genus Orthobunyavirus), detected in Thailand over 30 years earlier and implicated as a public health problem. Using RT-PCR, nucleotide sequences from the M RNA segment of several virus isolates from the Cambodian C. plicata bats were found to be almost identical and to differ from those of the prototype KK virus by only 2.6-3.2 %, despite the temporal and geographic separation of the viruses. These results identify the Cambodian bat viruses as KK virus, extend the known virus geographic range and document the first KK virus isolation in 30 years. These genetic data, together with earlier serologic data, show that KK viruses represent a distinct group within the genus Orthobunyavirus.

      Influenza viruses have been reported from marine mammals worldwide, particularly in pinnipeds, and have caused mass mortalities of seals in North America and Europe. Because influenza viruses in marine mammals can be zoonotic, our objective was to examine Canadian phocids for exposure to influenza A and B viruses in order to understand health risks to wild populations as well as to humans who consume or handle these animals. Blood was collected from 394 seals in eastern Canada from 1994 to 2005. Sera were screened for exposure to influenza viruses in three resident species of seals: harbour, Phoca vitulina (n=66); grey, Halichoerus grypus (n=82); ringed, Phoca hispida (n=2); and two migrant species: harp, Pagophilus groenlandica (n=206) and hooded, Cystophora cristata (n=38). Included were samples from captive grey (n=1) and harbour seals (n=8) at two aquaria. Sera were prescreened using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and antibodies against influenza A virus were confirmed using a commercial competitive ELISA (IDEXX Europe B.V.). A subset of influenza A virus positive sera was used to determine common virus subtypes recognized by sera using reference strains. All positive sera in the indirect ELISA reacted with influenza A virus subtypes H3, H4, and H10 using a hemagglutination inhibition assay. Sera from harbour, grey, harp, and hooded seals had antibodies against influenza A and influenza B viruses (some cross-reactivity occurred). Overall, 33% (128/385) of wild seals were seropositive to influenza viruses, with the highest seroprevalence in harp (42%) followed by harbour (33%), grey (23%), and hooded (11%) seals. Antibodies were detected in both sexes and most age classes of wild seals. Two of eight captive harbour seals were seropositive to influenza B virus and four had cross-reactions to influenza A and B viruses. This study reports antibodies against influenza A and B viruses in four seal species from the same geographic area in eastern Canada.

      We have previously demonstrated the presence of rhesus monkey papillomavirus type 1 (RhPV-1), from molecular and pathological evidence, in a mating group within a single institution. We have now also obtained a number of fresh or archival tissues of rhesus monkeys from other geographically distinct institutions. Using PCR amplification, we observed two animals from one of these institutions and five animals from another which demonstrated RhPV-1 DNA sequences. In addition we molecularly cloned the E7, E2, E4, L2 and L1 genes of RhPV-1 into bacterial expression vectors. The fusion gene products were used to test for serological response to RhPV-1 antigens by Western blot analysis. Responses were observed in up to 52% of the animals tested. While some serologically positive animals were also RhPV-1 DNA-positive, most were not.

      Several papillomas from a single patient who exhibited an unusual immune deficiency syndrome were analyzed for the presence of specific human papillomavirus (HPV) types. Preliminary analysis indicated that the HPV DNA species present in each of these tissues was quite unlike any of the previously characterized HPV types. In order to more rigorously analyze the HPV from this patient we have isolated the HPV DNA by molecularly cloning it into a bacteriophage lambda vector and have constructed a detailed restriction endonuclease map. Comparative hybridization studies using S1 nuclease analyses showed 6% or less nucleotide sequence homology of this viral DNA with HPV types 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or an HPV-11, molecularly cloned in this laboratory. Moreover, Southern blot analyses under stringent hybridization conditions revealed little, if any, hybridization to HPV types 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, HPV-EV isolated from a patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV), or 2 previously described HPVs (HPV-P and HPV-PW) related to HPV-3. There was, however, a very weak sequence homology detected with HPV-6 and an extremely weak homology to HPV-3. No filter hybridization was observed with the recently characterized HPVs 9 or -12 to -24. These data accumulatively indicate that the HPV species from this immunosuppressed patient represents a new, hitherto unidentified HPV type.

      Although human B19 parvovirus infection has been clearly associated with a number of distinct syndromes (including severe anemia, abortion, and arthritis), detailed knowledge of its pathogenesis has been hindered by the lack of a suitable animal model. We have identified a novel simian parvovirus in cynomolgus monkeys with severe anemia. Sequencing of a 723-bp fragment of cloned viral DNA extracted from serum revealed that the simian parvovirus has 65% homology at the DNA level with the human B19 parvovirus but little homology with other known parvoviruses. Light microscopic examination of bone marrow from infected animals showed intranuclear inclusion bodies, and ultrastructural studies showed viral arrays characteristic of parvoviruses. Another striking feature was the presence of marked dyserythropoiesis in cells of the erythroid lineage, raising the possibility that B19 parvovirus infection may underlie related dyserythropoietic syndromes in human beings. Affected animals had concurrent infection with the immunosuppressive type D simian retrovirus, analogous to HIV patients who develop severe anemia because of infection with B19 parvovirus. The remarkable similarities between the simian and B19 parvoviruses suggest that experimentally infected cynomolgus monkeys may serve as a useful animal model of human B19 infection.

      Three urban rabies outbreaks have been reported in Colombia during the last two decades, one of these is occurring in the Caribbean Region (northern Colombia), while the other two occurred almost simultaneously in Arauca (eastern Colombia) and in the Central Region and ended in 1997. In order to derive phylogenetic relationships between rabies viruses isolated in these three areas, 902 nt cDNA fragments encoding the cytoplasmic domain of protein G and a fragment of protein L were obtained by RT-PCR. These amplicons contained the G-L intergenic region and were sequenced to draw phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic analysis showed three distinct groups of viruses in the study sample. Colombian genetic variant I viruses were isolated in both Arauca and the Central Region. These viruses are apparently extinct in Colombia. Colombian genetic variant II viruses were isolated in the Caribbean Region and are still being transmitted in that area. The third group of viruses consists of viruses isolated from two insectivorous bats, three domestic dogs and a human. According to sequence analysis, the data here indicate that the isolates in this third group are bat rabies virus variants. This finding is the first that associates bats to rabies in Colombian dogs and humans, showing an unsuspected vector threatening animal and public health.

      West Nile virus (WNV) infection in 4 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) resulted in lymphohistiocytic encephalomyelitis within the medulla oblongata and cervical spinal cord. Immunohistochemistry revealed WNV antigen within neurons and among mononuclear cell infiltrates. These represent the first known cases of clinical WNV infection in Cervidae. Clinical signs and lesions were similar to those described in horses. Nucleotide sequence of a 768-bp region of the WNV E-glycoprotein gene revealed 1 nucleotide mutation, which resulted in a single amino acid substitution from a serine to a glycine (position 227 of E-glycoprotein) when compared with the prototype WNV-NY99 strain (isolated from Bronx zoo flamingo 382-99).

      Between 1985 and 2008, a total of 102,387 wild boar sera originating from Eastern Germany covering an area of 108 589 km2 were tested for the presence of Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV)-specific antibodies. From 1985 until 1991 and from 1992 until 2008, wild boar sera were exclusively investigated using either conventional seroneutralization assays (n=39 621) or commercial gB and full antigen ELISAs (n=62,766), respectively. Spatial-temporal analysis revealed an increasing ADV seroprevalence from 0·4% to 15·9%, on average, during the 24-year observation period that went along with a continuous spread of the infection in a western direction. During 2006 and 2008, 18% of the 66 affected districts had ADV seroprevalences >30%. There was a significant correlation between ADV seroprevalence and the hunting index of population density (HIPD) of wild boar in the entire study area, although this did not hold true for some regions. Seroprevalences did not differ between sexes but were age-dependent. East Germany has been officially free of Aujeszky's disease (pseudorabies) in domestic pigs since 1985. Although a risk for domestic pigs cannot be completely ruled out, experience has shown that ADV in domestic pigs could be eliminated although the virus was present in the wild boar population. Despite increasing ADV seroprevalence in the East German wild boar population no spillover infections from wild boar to domestic pigs have been reported. To further trace ADV infections in the wild boar population in Germany, a nationwide serological monitoring programme should be implemented.

      A new virus isolated from the lungs of rats is prevalent in colony reared and wild rats and induces a fatal pneumonitis in newborn rats. The virus, designated as rat coronavirus (RCV), exhibits properties representative of the coronavirus group: characteristic surface structure, particles somewhat variable in size averaging approximately 90 mμ, apparent RNA content, essential lipid, heat sensitivity, and a close serologie relationship with the mouse hepatitis virus complex. RCV grows well in primary rat kidney cell cultures, exhibits a pathognomonic type CPE, and produces a complement fixing antigen which is sensitive for detection of antibody and useful in sero-epidemiologic studies.

      The pathogenesis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in fetal, newborn, and young adult hamsters was studied. Infected newborn hamsters initially developed a persistent viremia and viruria with titers often in excess of 10(4.0) mean infectious doses/0.03 ml of blood or urine. After week 12 two different patterns of infection became evident. Approximately one-half of the hamsters eventually cleared the infection, whereas the others developed a chronic progressive and ultimalely fatal disease characterized by continuous high-titered viremia and viruria and high titers of virus in their tissues. Complement-fixing antibody and, to a lesser degree, virus-neutralizing antibody coexisted with the viremia. Hamsters with persistently high levels of viremia and viruria developed chronic glomerulonephritis and widespread vasculitis, whereas hamsters that cleared their infections did not develop these lesions. Litters of hamsters born to viremic mothers were invariably infected. Litter sizes were small and breeding effectiveness was reduce; however, vertical, congenital infection was successfully passed through three generations. The course of infection in the congenitally infected hamsters was similar to that in newborn infected hamsters, with all animals producing complement-fixing antibody, some animals being capable of clearing the viremia and remaining healthy, and other animals having persistent viremia and fatal disease. Inoculated young adult hamsters did not become diseased, developed viremia and viruria which persisted up to 3 and 6 months, respectively, and developed complement-fixing antibody by 10 days after infection. The prolonged urinary excretion of large amounts of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus by asymptomatic, chronically infected hamsters is an important public health consideration when dealing with potential human infection.

      The seroepidemiology of the defective adenovirus-associated satellite viruses was studied by use of a neutralization test that has been shown to be much more sensitive than the complement-fixation (CF) test. Less than 25% of the subjects in any age group were positive for any type of satellite virus CF antibody. The neutralization test revealed serological evidence of satellite infection in almost 80% of the subjects in some age groups. Studies of geometric mean antibody titers by neutralization showed that antibody against type 1 and the type 2-3 complex reached peak levels at 2 to 3 years of age; antibody against types 2 and 3 reached mean titers of 500 to 800, whereas mean antibody levels of only 200 were found for type 1. Type 4 antibodies were rarely noted in human sera. In a companion study in monkeys, monospecific responses to types 1 and 4 were found only in rhesus and green monkey sera, respectively. These data suggest that the type 2-3 complex may be the only naturally occurring satellite serotype which infects man and that antibodies noted against types 1 and 4 may be the result of cross-reactions. No satellite viruses were isolated from throat or rectal swabs of 100 children between 6 months and 3 years of age. However, the patterns of adenovirus and enterovirus isolations from these specimens were typical of previous studies in this laboratory.

      Economic losses due to infection with Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) have prompted introduction of organized control programs. These programs primarily focus on the removal of persistently infected (PI) animals, the main source of BVDV transmission. Recently, persistent BVDV infection was demonstrated experimentally in white-tailed deer, the most abundant wild ruminant in North America. Contact of cattle and white-tailed deer may result in interspecific BVDV transmission and birth of persistently infected offspring that could be a threat to control programs. The objective of this study was to assess the potential for interspecific BVDV transmission from persistently infected cattle cohabitated with pregnant white-tailed deer. Seven female and one male white-tailed deer were captured and bred in captivity. At approximately 50 days of gestation, two cattle persistently infected with BVDV 1 were cohabitated with the deer. In a pen of approximately 0.8 ha, both species shared food and water sources for a period of 60 days. Transmission of BVDV as indicated by seroconversion was demonstrated in all exposed adult deer. Of the seven pregnancies, four resulted in offspring that were infected with BVDV. Persistent infection was demonstrated in three singlet fawns by immunohistochemistry and ELISA on skin samples, PCR, and virus isolation procedures. Furthermore, two stillborn fetuses were apparently persistently infected. This is the first report of BVDV transmission from cattle to white-tailed deer using a model of natural challenge. Under appropriate circumstances, BVDV may efficiently cross the species barrier to cause transplacental infection and persistently infected offspring in a wildlife species.

      Phylogenetic investigations, sequence comparisons, and antigenic cross-reactivity studies confirmed the classification of Thailand virus (THAIV) as a distinct hantavirus species. The examination of sera from 402 rodents trapped in 19 provinces of Thailand revealed that five greater bandicoot rats (Bandicota indica) and one lesser bandicoot rat (B. savilei) from four provinces were focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) antibody-positive for THAIV. One of 260 patients from Surin province in Thailand (initially suspected of having contracted leptospirosis, but found to be negative) showed symptoms compatible with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). The serum of this patient showed high titers of hantavirus-reactive IgM and IgG. FRNT investigations confirmed virus-neutralizing antibodies against THAIV. These observations suggest that THAIV or THAI-like viruses occur throughout Indochina and may represent an additional causative agent of HFRS.

      Serum samples from 58 mountain lions (Felis concolor) in California (USA) were collected between April 1987 and February 1990. Nineteen serum samples were used for serum biochemistry determinations; the ranges were similar to reference values in domestic cats, captive exotic felidae and free-ranging mountain lions. A serological survey was conducted to determine whether antibodies were present against selected infectious agents. Fifty-four (93%) of 58 sera had antibodies against feline panleukopenia virus. Fifteen (68%) of 22, 16 (28%) of 58, 11 (19%) of 58, and 10 (17%) of 58 had serum antibodies against feline reovirus, feline coronavirus, feline herpes virus, and feline calicivirus, respectively. Twenty-three (40%) of 58 and 21 (58%) of 36 had serum antibodies against Yersinia pestis and Toxoplasma gondii, respectively. Only one of 22 sera had antibodies against the somatic antigen of Dirofilaria immitis. Feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus antigens were not detected in any mountain lion's sera. All 58 sera samples were negative for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus and Chlamydia psittaci.

      A recent study reported neutralizing antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in horses from four ranches of southern Pantanal. To extend that study, a serosurvey for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses was conducted with 760 equines, 238 sheep and 61 caimans from 17 local cattle ranches. Among the tested equines, 32 were collected from a ranch where a neurologic disorder outbreak had been recently reported. The sera were initially screened by using a blocking ELISA and then titrated by 90% plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) for 12 flaviviruses. Employing the criterion of 4-fold greater titer, 78 (10.3%) equines were seropositive for Ilheus virus, 59 (7.8%) for Saint Louis encephalitis virus, 24 (3.2%) for WNV, two (0.3%) for Cacipacore virus and one (0.1%) for Rocio virus. No serological evidence was found linking the neurological disease that affected local equines to WNV. All caimans and sheep were negative by blocking ELISA for flaviviruses. There were no seropositive equines for Bussuquara, Iguape, Yellow fever and all four Dengue virus serotypes. The detection of WNV-seropositive equines in ten ranches and ILHV and SLEV-seropositive equines in fourteen ranches of two different sub-regions of Pantanal is strong evidence of widespread circulation of these flaviviruses in the region.

      Duvenhage virus was isolated from a patient who died of a rabies-like disease after being scratched by a bat early in 2006. This occurred approximately 80 km from the site where the only other known human infection with the virus had occurred 36 years earlier.

      Field-collected Culicoides species (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) were fed on horse blood-virus mixtures containing one of the six serotypes of equine encephalosis virus (EEV1 to EEV6). The virus mean titres in the bloodmeals varied between 6.1 and 7.0 log10TCID50/mL. Of 19 Culicoides species assayed after 10 days extrinsic incubation at 23.5 degrees C, five yielded the challenge virus, namely Culicoides (Avaritia) imicola Kieffer (EEV1-6), C. (A.) bolitinos Meiswinkel (EEV1, 2, 4, 6), C. (Meijerehelea) leucostictus Kiefer (EEV1, 2), C. (Culicoides) magnus Colaço (EEV1) and C. (Hoffmania) zuluensis de Meillon (EEV2). Virus recovery rates ranged from 0.5 to 13%. The mean levels of viral replication differed between serotypes and Culicoides species and ranged from 1.0 to 2.3 log10TCID50/midge. Culicoides midges shown in this study to be susceptible to oral infection with EEV are widely distributed in South Africa but differ considerably in their abundance, host preference and breeding sites. Of 1456 horses tested, 1144 (77%) had antibody to EEV. Homologous virus-neutralizing antibodies to all six serotypes were detected in individual horses from all eight geographical provinces of South Africa. The distribution, prevalence, and the rate of exposure to individual serotypes varied significantly between regions. The potential for vectoring of EEV in the field by several Culicoides species with unique ecologies and lack of cross-protection to re-infection with multiple serotypes highlights some of the mechanisms that are likely to play a role in the virus' natural maintenance cycle and the highly efficient level of countrywide transmission amongst South African horses.

      We report the first worldwide case of Usutu virus (USUV) neuroinvasive infection in a patient with diffuse large B cell lymphoma who presented with fever and neurological symptoms and was diagnosed with meningoencephalitits. The cerebrospinal fluid was positive for USUV, and USUV was also demonstrated in serum and plasma samples by RT-PCR and sequencing. Partial sequences of the premembrane and NS5 regions of the viral genome were similar to the USUV Vienna and Budapest isolates.

      To assess human exposure to Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in west central Africa, we looked for SIV infection in 788 monkeys that were hunted in the rainforests of Cameroon for bushmeat or kept as pets. Serologic reactivity suggesting SIV infection was found in 13 of 16 primate species, including 4 not previously known to harbor SIV. Overall, 131 sera (16.6%) reacted strongly and an additional 34 (4.3%) reacted weakly with HIV antigens. Molecular analysis identified five new phylogenetic SIV lineages. These data document for the first time that a substantial proportion of wild monkeys in Cameroon are SIV infected and that humans who hunt and handle bushmeat are exposed to a plethora of genetically highly divergent viruses.

      A seroepidemiological study of arboviruses infecting 115 wild toque macaques (Macaca sinica) at Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka showed a high prevalence of antibodies to dengue and Lumbo viruses. There was low seroprevalence of Chandipura (2/115) and Batai (1/115) virus antibodies, but no seropositivity to Chikungunya or Sindbis. There was no serological evidence of infection by Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in spite of large human epidemics in the study area, indicating that toque macaques are unlikely to be an epidemiologically relevant host in the maintenance cycle of JE virus.

      New BVDV strains associated with very high mortalities, which killed about 25% of the veal calves in Quebec in 1993, have been isolated. In this study, characterization of the last two-thirds of the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of their genome and virus neutralization experiments with polyvalent antisera raised in different animals both demonstrated that these strains formed a distinct group. Despite a difference of about 25% in the 5'UTR sequence with that of the classical strains, these 5'UTRs maintained the same secondary structure albeit with a higher stability. Serological crossreactivity between the classical and new BVDV strains was relatively low and suggest that new strains should also be included to obtain efficient BVDV vaccines. Based upon the distinct characteristics of these new BVDV strains, we propose to divide BVDV into two groups. Group I comprises the classical BVDV isolates including commonly used laboratory and vaccine strains, and group II comprises the newly described BVDV strains and those associated with thrombocytopenia and hemorrhaging.

      Examination of the intestinal contents of free-living Oryzomys nigripes rats by PAGE revealed two sharply defined bands that could be stained by ethidium bromide or by silver nitrate with comparable intensities. The molecules forming these bands were susceptible to digestion by pancreatic RNase A but not by RNase T1 or by DNase I. Their lengths were estimated to be about 2.6 and 1.5 kbp, respectively, by comparison with rotavirus SA11 genome segments. They cosedimented in CsCl gradients at a density of 1.39 to 1.40 g/ml, together with uniform particles approximately 35 nm in diameter with indistinct surface structure. It is suggested that these particles represent an as yet undescribed virus with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome, for which the name 'picobirnavirus' is proposed.

      Vaccinia virus (VACV), the etiological agent of an exanthematic disease, has been associated with several bovine outbreaks in Brazil since the end of the global vaccination campaign against smallpox. It was previously believed that the vaccine virus used for the WHO global campaign had adapted to an unknown wild reservoir and was sporadically re-emerging in outbreaks in cattle and milkers. At present, it is known that Brazilian VACV is phylogenetically different from the vaccinia virus vaccinal strain, but its origin remains unknown. This study assessed the seroprevalence of orthopoxviruses in domestic and wild animals and farmers from 47 farms in three cities in the southwest region of the state of São Paulo with or without official reports of outbreaks in cattle or humans. Our data indicate a low seroprevalence of antibodies in wild animals and raise interesting questions about the real potential of wild rodents and marsupials as VACV reservoirs, suggesting other routes through which VACV can be spread.

      Two strains of Punta Toro virus (PTV), isolated from febrile humans in Panama, cause a differential pathogenesis in Syrian hamsters, which could be a useful model for understanding the virulence characteristics and differential outcomes in other phleboviral infections such as Rift Valley fever virus. Genetic reassortants produced between the lethal Adames (A/A/A) and nonlethal Balliet (B/B/B) strains were used in this study to investigate viral genetic determinants for pathogenesis and lethality in the hamster model. The S segment was revealed to be a critical genome segment, determining lethality with log(10) 50% lethal doses for each PTV genotype as follows (L/M/S convention): A/A/A, <0.7; B/A/A, <0.7; A/B/A, 1.5; B/B/A, 2.2; B/A/B, 4.7; A/B/B, >4.7; A/A/B, >4.7; B/B/B, >4.7. In addition, the Adames strain inhibits the induction of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) in vivo and in vitro and inhibits the activation of the IFN-beta promoter. Expression of the PTV Adames NSs protein, encoded by the S RNA segment, inhibited the virus-mediated induction of an IFN-beta promoter-driven reporter gene, suggesting that PTV NSs functions as a type I IFN antagonist. Taken together, these data indicate a mechanism of pathogenesis in which the suppression of the type I IFN response early during PTV infection leads to early and uncontrolled viral replication and, ultimately, hamster death. This study contributes to our understanding of Phlebovirus pathogenesis and identifies potential targets for immune modulation to increase host survival.

      We isolated an apparently new virus in the family Paramyxoviridae from stillborn piglets with deformities at a piggery in New South Wales, Australia. In 1997, the pregnancy rate and litter size at the piggery decreased markedly, while the proportion of mummified fetuses increased. We found serologic evidence of infection in pigs at the affected piggery and two associated piggeries, in humans exposed to infected pigs, and in fruit bats. Menangle virus is proposed as a common name for this agent, should further studies confirm that it is a newly recognized virus.

      Antibody titres to selected pathogens (canine adenovirus [CAV-2], feline herpesvirus [FHV], phocine herpesvirus [PHV-1], canine distemper virus, dolphin morbillivirus [DMV], phocine distemper virus [PDV], parainfluenza virus type 3 [PI3], rabies virus, dolphin rhabdovirus [DRV], canine coronavirus, feline coronavirus, feline leukaemia virus, Borrelia burgdorferi and Toxoplasma gondii) were determined in whole blood or serum samples from selected free-ranging terrestrial carnivores and marine mammals, including cougars (Fellis concolor), lynxes (Fellis lynx), American badgers (Taxidea taxus), fishers (Martes pennanti), wolverines (Gulo gulo), wolves (Canis lupus), black bears (Ursus americanus), grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), polar bears (Ursus maritimus), walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) and belugas (Delphinapterus leucas), which had been collected at several locations in Canada between 1984 and 2001. Antibodies to a number of viruses were detected in species in which these infections have not been reported before, for example, antibodies to CAV-2 in walruses, to PDV in black bears, grizzly bears, polar bears, lynxes and wolves, to DMV in grizzly bears, polar bears, walruses and wolves, to PI3 in black bears and fishers, and to DRV in belugas and walruses.

      Eighty-three serum samples were obtained from big brown (Eptesicus fuscus), little brown (Myotis lucifugus), and northern long-eared (Myotis septentriotalis) bats (Chiroptera: Vespertilionidae), from New Jersey and New York (USA) between July and October 2002. Samples were analyzed for neutralizing antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus. One little brown bat and one northern long-eared bat tested positive for WNV neutralizing antibodies. No bats had antibodies to SLE virus. This was the first large-scale investigation of WNV infection in bats in New Jersey. Additional work is needed to determine the effects of WNV on bat populations.

      Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex includes viruses considered emerging pathogens for humans and animals in the Americas. Two members of this complex have been detected previously in Argentina: Rio Negro Virus (RNV), detected in mosquitoes from Chaco province and rodents from Formosa province, and Pixuna Virus (PIXV), detected in mosquitoes from Chaco province. To carry out surveillance studies in other parts of the country, detection of a 195-bp fragment of alphaviruses by RT-nested PCR was performed in mosquito samples from San Miguel de Tucumán city. Four pools resulted positive and three were sequenced. Two amplicons grouped with RNV and one with PIXV. This is the first report of viral activity of members of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex in north-eastern Argentina.

      Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV) are responsible for human diseases in the Americas, producing severe or mild illness with symptoms indistinguishable from dengue and other arboviral diseases. For this reason, many cases remain without certain diagnosis. Seroprevalence studies for VEEV subtypes IAB, ID, IF (Mosso das Pedras virus; MDPV), IV (Pixuna virus; PIXV) and VI (Rio Negro virus; RNV) were conducted in persons from Northern provinces of Argentina: Salta, Chaco and Corrientes, using plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). RNV was detected in all studied provinces. Chaco presented the highest prevalence of this virus (14.1%). Antibodies against VEEV IAB and -for the first time- against MDPV and PIXV were also detected in Chaco province. In Corrientes, seroprevalence against RNV was 1.3% in the pediatric population, indicating recent infections. In Salta, this was the first investigation of VEEV members, and antibodies against RNV and PIXV were detected. These results provide evidence of circulation of many VEE viruses in Northern Argentina, showing that surveillance of these infectious agents should be intensified.

      Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV) are emerging pathogens of medical and veterinary importance circulating in America. Argentina is a country free from epizootic VEEV activity, with circulation of enzootic strains belonging to Rio Negro virus (RNV; VEEV subtype VI) and Pixuna virus (PIXV, VEEV subtype IV). In this work, we aim to report the sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of all Argentinean VEE viruses, including 7 strains previously isolated from mosquitoes in 1980, 5 sequences obtained from rodents in 1991 and 11 sequences amplified from mosquitoes between 2003 and 2005. Two genomic regions, corresponding to the non-structural protein 4 (nsP4) and the protein E3/E2 (PE2) genes were analyzed, but only 8 samples could be amplified in the last one (longer and more variable fragment of 702 bp). For both genomic fragments, phylogenetic trees showed the absence of lineages within RNV group, and a close genetic relationship between Argentinean strains and the prototype strain BeAr35645 for PIXV clade. The analysis of nsP4 gene opens the possibility to propose a possible geographic clustering of strains within PIXV group (Argentina and Brazil). Coalescent analysis performed on RNV sequences suggested a common ancestor of 58.3 years (with a 95% highest posterior density [HPD] interval of 16.4-345.7) prior to 1991 and inferred a substitution rate of 9.8×10(-5)substitutions/site/year, slightly lower than other enzootic VEE viruses. These results provide, for the first time, information about genetic features and variability of all VEEVs detected in Argentina, creating a database that will be useful for future detections in our country. This is particularly important for RNV, which has indigenous circulation.

      Three strains of yellow fever virus (YFV) were isolated in 1982 in The Ivory Coast, one from a human case and two from Aedes luteocephalus, during and subsequent to an epidemic. The complete genomic sequence of the human strain was determined and compared to that of the 1927 Asibi strain of YFV. The divergence observed was on average of 8.3%, ranging from 5.5 to 11.7% in the coding region. The transitions to transversions ratio was 5.9. Most mutations (84.3%) occurred on the third position of the codons, with synonymous mutations representing 92.5%. However, when partial sequences representing 60% of each genome were compared, homology between the three Ivory Coast strains was greater than 99%. These results demonstrate the homogeneity of the virus strains circulating in different hosts and vectors in a limited geographical region and validate the concept of topotype in viral quasi-species.

      Hantaviruses (genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) represent a prime example of emerging viruses. Since isolation of the prototype Hantaan virus in the late 70s more than 20 new species have been described and the number is increasing fast thus demanding for a more refined classification. Taking into account that hantaviruses are difficult to isolate in cell culture, one should not be surprised that most of the ""newcomers"" were first described as distinct hantavirus genotypes. Moreover, the only ""solid"" characteristics of many hantavirus species still exist in the form of nucleotide sequences of their genome. The relatively short history of hantavirology can thus be taken to illustrate how genetics can contribute to (and even, perhaps, dominate) discovery, characterization and classification of viruses. In this review the following aspects of hantavirus genetics are discussed: (i) genome structure; (ii) genetic diversity and evolution; and (iii) use of genetic criteria in current taxonomy of hantaviruses. In addition, several examples of classification of hantavirus species (New York virus, Saaremaa virus and Hokkaido virus) are given, and future prospects are analyzed.

      Hantavirus genome sequences were recovered from tissue samples of Myodes rufocanus, Microtus fortis and Microtus oeconomus captured in the Baikal area of Buryatia, Russian Federation. Genetic analysis of S- and M-segment sequences of Buryatian hantavirus strains showed that Myodes-associated strains belong to Hokkaido virus (HOKV) type while Microtus-associated strains belong to Vladivostok virus (VLAV) type. On phylogenetic trees Buryatian HOKV strains were clustered together with M. rufocanus- originated strains from Japan, China and Far-East Russia (Primorsky region). Buryatian Microtus- originated strains shared a common recent ancestor with M. fortis- originated VLAV strain from Far-East Russia (Vladivostok area). Our data (i) confirm that M. rufocanus carries a hantavirus which is similar to but distinct from both Puumala virus carried by M. glareolus and Muju virus associated with M. regulus, (ii) confirm that M. fortis is the natural host for VLAV, and (iii) suggest M. oeconomus as an alternative host for VLAV.

      The authors describe a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect bluetongue viruses (BTV) in blood samples. The primers and Taqman probes used were specific for a conserved region of BTV RNA segment 5, which encodes non-structural protein NS1. The method was able to detect strains of BTV serotypes 2, 4, 9 and 16 isolated in Italy, and their respective vaccine strains. The limit of detection was 5.0x10-(3) TCID(50) per ml of sample. The assay did not amplify RNA from other Orbiviruses, including epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) or African horse sickness virus (AHSV), or from viruses in the Reoviridae family or those that cause a similar clinical picture to that of BTV. Its accuracy was evaluated on 104 blood samples in ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) and the results were compared with those obtained with the conventional RT-PCR used in routine diagnosis. Both tests gave negative results on 40 blood samples from bluetongue-free farms (confidence interval: 95%, 92.5-100%). Real-time PCR detected BTV RNA in 64 sentinel cows that had recently seroconverted to serotypes 2 and 16 (confidence interval: 95%, 95.5-100%), whereas conventional RT-PCR detected only 47 of these (confidence interval: 95%, 61.5-82.7%) (P<0.05). The method is rapid, thereby reducing execution times, and does not require any post-amplification manipulation, thus avoiding the inherent risk of contamination of amplified products.

      Rabies virus (RV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) can cause significant mortality in wild carnivore populations, and RV threatens human lives. We investigated serological patterns of exposure to CDV and RV in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris), African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas), spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), striped hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and African lions (Panthera leo), over a 10-year period, in a Kenyan rangeland to assess the role domestic dogs may play in the transmission dynamics of these two important canid pathogens. Observed patterns of RV exposure suggested that repeated introduction, rather than maintenance, occurred in the wild carnivore species studied. However, RV appeared to have been maintained in domestic dogs: exposure was more likely in domestic dogs than in the wild carnivores; was detected consistently over time without variation among years; and was detected in juveniles (≤1-year-old) as well as adults (>1-year-old). We conclude that this domestic dog population could be a RV reservoir. By contrast, the absence of evidence of CDV exposure for each carnivore species examined in the study area, for specific years, suggested repeated introduction, rather than maintenance, and that CDV may require a larger reservoir population than RV. This reservoir could be a larger domestic dog population; another wildlife species; or a ""metareservoir"" consisting of multiple interconnected carnivore populations. Our findings suggest that RV risks to people and wild carnivores might be controlled by domestic dog vaccination, but that CDV control, if required, would need to target the species of concern.

      M813 is a type-C murine leukemia virus (MuLV) isolated from the Asian rodent Mus cervicolor. We have recently demonstrated that M813 defines a distinct MuLV receptor interference group. Here we show that M813 rapidly induces fusion of MuLV-expressing fibroblasts from ""without,"" with syncytia being observed within 1 h after exposure to virus. Infection of fibroblasts with MuLV from all tested receptor-interference groups imparts susceptibility to M813-induced fusion, provided the cells also express the M813 receptor. Syncytium induction is also observed in vivo; mice infected with M813 develop a peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which is associated with large multinucleated cells of macrophage origin. A recombinant Moloney MuLV/M813 chimeric virus demonstrated that syncytium induction is a function of the Env SU protein. We postulate that the highly fusogenic property of M813 is attributable to either its unique receptor usage or sequences in the proline-rich domain of the Env protein.

      A nested polymerase chain reaction was used to identify 13 pestivirus strains isolated from small ruminants in several mixed (sheep and goats) flocks of Southern Italy, and for classification as bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) type 1, BVDV type 2, and Border disease virus (BDV) genotypes. Of the nine ovine isolates, two were characterized as BVDV type 1, and seven as BVDV type 2. The four pestiviruses isolated from kids belong to BVDV type 1. None of the pestivirus strains tested could be classified as 'true' BDV (genotype 3). Although BVDV type 2 has been described in Europe rarely, the characterization of BD/90-1M strain as BVDV type 2, isolated in Italy in 1990, demonstrates that this genotype has been circulating in Italy since the 1990s.

      Epizootics of Rift Valley fever (RVF) are often associated with periods of heavy rainfall, which are favorable for mosquito vectors. However, in seasons with normal or low rainfall, enzootic circulation occurs, suggesting the existence of a natural host that can act as a cryptic carrier during interepizootic periods. To confirm the role of heavy rainfall in epizootic circulation, and to identify a possible natural host of RVF virus, serum samples from small terrestrial mammals in the Free State and Northern Cape regions of South Africa were collected before and after the 1988 floods. These areas are known to support epizootic circulation of RVF virus. The samples were tested for the presence of RVF virus-specific IgG using an ELISA and positive sera were confirmed by a neutralization test. Forty-seven (15%) of 312 Aethomys namaquensis (Namaqua rock rat) had antibodies to RVF virus. Of these positive sera, nine (6%) of 141 were collected before the floods of 1988 and 38 (22%) of 171 were collected afterwards (P = 0.001). Naive A. namaquensis were inoculated with RVF virus and developed a viremia, but no clinical symptoms, suggesting that they can act as temporary asymptomatic carriers of the virus. These results suggest a role for A. namaquensis as a cryptic carrier for RVF virus during interepizootic periods and support the results of other studies suggesting an amplifying role for heavy rainfall in the circulation of RVF virus.

      Sera from 39 species of bats collected in Trinidad between 1972 and 1974 were tested against some or all of 18 arboviruses in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and/or suckling mouse neutralization (N) tests. A few sera were HI-positive with Mucambo, eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), Oriboca, Restan, Manzanilla, Guama, Bimiti, and Catu. No sera were HI-positive with Mayaro, Caraparu or Maguari. Many ser inhibited one or more of the group B hemagglutinins: Ilheus, St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), dengue 2, and yellow fever (YF), positives occurred in nearly every species of bat, being most frequent with Ilheus. In N tests, a few or single sera were found to protect against Ilheus, Nepuyo, Guama, Bimiti, and Cocal, while none protected against EEE, SLE, YF or Catu. Many sera positive in HI test with Ilheus, SLE or YF failed to neutralize the respective virus. Tacaribe neutralizing antibody was demonstrated in Artibeus jamaicensis and A. lituratus, the sources of past virus isolation, in the fruit bats Sturnira lilium and Vampyrops helleri, and in the vampire bat Desmodus rotundus. Sera from 19 other species gave either negative or inconclusive results. No convincing evidence of Tacaribe antibody was found in 29 human sera, 20 from bat collectors.

      Rabies virus was detected by fluorescent-antibody and mouse inoculation tests in the brain of one bat, Artibeus jamaicensis, collected at La Tante, Grenada on 19 June 1974. No rabies virus was found in the brains and/or salivary glands of 411 other Grenadian bats of 6 species tested, including 56 A. jamaicensis. Rabies neutralizing antibody was detected by the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) in 27 of 353 Grenadian bats. Positives occurred in each of the 6 species sampled, with 40.5% prevalence in A. jamaicensis. In 11 of 86 Trinidadian bats of 4 species known to carry rabies, positive sera occurred only in A. jamaicensis (18.6%) and A. lituratus (18.1%). The potential use of the REFIT indetermining rabies activity is discussed.

      More than 75% of a random sample of adult human sera exhibited moderate to high murine pneumonia virus (PVM)-neutralizing activity. There was no correlation between PVM-neutralizing activity and respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza type 3 virus-neutralizing activities of the same sera. In children the proportion of sera with moderate to high titres increased with age, indicating early exposure to infection. Seroconversion (i.e. greater than fourfold increase in titre) was observed in four of 108 paired samples of previously undiagnosed respiratory infections. These observations suggest that the human population is frequently exposed to infection with PVM or an antigenically related virus. The sera of patients suffering from Paget's disease of bone tended to exhibit higher than normal PVM-neutralizing titres in comparison with the sera of patients with other bone diseases. Thus, PVM (or an antigenically related virus) resembles some other parainfluenza viruses in being circumstantially associated with Paget's disease of bone.

      This study presents results of epidemiological survey and genetic characterisation of porcine enteric picornaviruses belonging to the genera Teschovirus, Sapelovirus, and Porcine enterovirus B. Faecal or gut content samples from domestic pigs (Sus scrofa f. domestica) and the cecal content of wild boars (Sus scrofa) of different ages (collected between 2005 and 2011) were analysed by molecular methods. Porcine enterovirus B was the most prevalent virus detected in both domestic pigs and wild boars (50.2% and 69.4%, respectively), followed by Porcine teschovirus and Porcine sapelovirus. The majority of positive domestic pigs (69.4%) and wild boars (64.3%) were infected with two or three tested viruses. There was no significant difference in prevalences of teschoviruses, sapeloviruses, and enteroviruses among healthy and diarrhoeic pigs. Results of epidemiological survey demonstrated that all target viral genera are common in Czech farms producing pigs and wild boars. Amplified nucleotide fragments of VP2 region obtained from randomly selected both historical and recent Teschovirus isolates were sequenced. Based on sequence data, historical Porcine teschovirus isolate CAPM V-180, previously determined as serotype 1 was reclassified into serotype 11. Moreover, another recent Porcine teschovirus isolate OH264/2010 was described and classified into serotype 11. Four nontypeable PTV strains (historical isolate CAPM V-182/1976 and recent isolates JA247/2010, NI429/2010, and BR1576/2007) identified in this study might represent novel serotypes. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the first description of this serotype in the Czech Republic.

      In 2011 an unprecedented epidemic of equine encephalitis occurred in south-eastern (SE) Australia following heavy rainfall and severe flooding in the preceding 2-4 months. Less than 6% of the documented cases occurred in Queensland, prompting the question of pre-existing immunity in Queensland horses. A small-scale serological survey was conducted on horses residing in one of the severely flood-affected areas of SE-Queensland. Using a flavivirus-specific blocking-ELISA we found that 63% (39/62) of horses older than 3 years were positive for flavivirus antibodies, and of these 18% (7/38) had neutralizing antibodies to Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), Kunjin virus (WNV(KUN)) and/or Alfuy virus (ALFV). The remainder had serum-neutralizing antibodies to viruses in the Kokobera virus (KOKV) complex or antibodies to unknown/untested flaviviruses. Amongst eight yearlings one presented with clinical MVEV-encephalomyelitis, while another, clinically normal, had MVEV-neutralizing antibodies. The remaining six yearlings were flavivirus antibody negative. Of 19 foals born between August and November 2011 all were flavivirus antibody negative in January 2012. This suggests that horses in the area acquire over time active immunity to a range of flaviviruses. Nevertheless, the relatively infrequent seropositivity to MVEV, WNV(KUN) and ALFV (15%) suggests that factors other than pre-existing immunity may have contributed to the low incidence of arboviral disease in SE-Queensland horses during the 2011 epidemic.

      Since late 2007, several outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection have emerged in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis places all Thai PEDV isolates during the outbreaks in the same clade as the Chinese strain JS-2004-2. This new genotype PEDV is prevailing and currently causing sporadic outbreaks in Thailand.

      Over 1,100 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) have occurred in Brazil since 1993, but little is known about Brazilian hantaviruses, and many of their rodent hosts remain unknown. The Araucaria hantavirus (ARAUV) was described recently from HPS patients from Paraná, in southern Brazil, but its host could not be identified. In this study, rodents were captured from regions with high HPS prevalence to address this issue. ARAUV RNA was detected in three distantly related rodent species: Oligoryzomys nigripes, Oxymycterus judex and Akodon montensis. Furthermore, a specimen of A. montensis was infected with a Jaborá-like virus, implying that A. montensis can be infected by at least two different hantaviruses. The presence of the same hantavirus strain in three different rodent species and the co-circulation of two different strains in the same rodent species highlight the potential for genomic reassortment, which could have an impact on hantavirus transmission dynamics in nature and on human epidemiology.

      Harderian gland neoplasms were identified in 18 aged, adult Beechey ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) from the records of 167 wild-caught captive animals that were necropsied. All but one animal had tumors that were classified as carcinomas, with infiltrative growth and frequent metastases. This is the first detailed report of Harderian gland neoplasia in wild Sciuridae, although this neoplasm has been described in other rodent species. Clinically, affected ground squirrels typically were inappetent and presented with weight loss and exophthalmos. The biologic behavior of Harderian gland neoplasia is variable among rodent species; in Beechey ground squirrels there was a high incidence of malignant behavior. Eleven of 17 tumor-bearing animals for which the gender was known were male, and 6 were female. Nine of 16 for which data were available were uninfected, and 7 had evidence of current or prior infection with ground squirrel hepatitis virus. Tumor development occurred in older animals; all but 2 were 5.5 years of age or older. The presence of metastasis was not related to gender or chronic ground squirrel hepatitis virus infection.

      Black Creek Canal (BCC) virus is a newly identified virus associated with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the southeastern United States. Nucleotide sequences were determined for the complete S and M and partial L genomic segments of a BCC virus isolate. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that each of the virus segments is unique, and there is no evidence of genetic reassortment having occurred between this and other previously characterized hantaviruses. All hantavirus-seropositive, wild-caught Sigmodon hispidus which were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of BCC virus RNA were found to be positive, consistent with a chronic virus infection. This finding, together with serologic evidence, confirms S. hispidus as the primary rodent reservoir of this virus. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these PCR products indicates that BCC virus is genetically diverse and may pose a public health threat throughout much of the extensive range of this rodent species. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated the presence of G1-, G2-, and N-specific antibodies in sera from BCC virus-infected patients with HPS and naturally infected S. hispidus. Comparison of the patterns of protein immunoprecipitation obtained with human acute- and convalescent-phase sera suggests that G1- and G2-specific antibodies increase relative to N-specific antibodies during the course of infection. The ratio of G1 to N protein immunoprecipitation by rodent or human acute-phase sera allowed differentiation of BCC and Sin Nombre virus infections.

      An environmental and laboratory investigation was conducted after a fatal childhood case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurred in Deaf Smith County, Texas in May 1995. A trapping campaign was conducted to identify possible rodent carriers. Six species of murid and heteromyid rodents were collected, and at least one hantavirus-seropositive specimen was found in each of the five murid species. Tissues from a selection of 11 seropositive specimens were examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of viral genetic material. The predominant hantavirus was El Moro Canyon virus (ELMCV), which occurred in three of three harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis) and in three of four deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) examined. Sin Nombre virus (SNV) was found in one deer mouse and one white-footed mouse (P. leucopus). A seropositive house mouse (Mus musculus) was negative by PCR. Two cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) were infected by a virus of novel genotype (Muleshoe virus [MULEV]) that bears closet resemblance to Bayou hantavirus. The sequence of the complete small genomic segment was determined for one MULEV, and high-level expression of its nucleocapsid protein was induced in Escherichia coli. Serologic studies indicated that the most likely etiologic agent in the human infection was SNV.

      Fatal encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infections in a ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), a squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), three mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), a pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis), and two Goodfellows tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus goodfellowi) occurred at Taronga Zoo. This is the first description of EMCV in a zoological collection outside of the United States. Regardless of species, the most common clinical presentation was sudden death. The gross pathologic changes were diffuse or focal pallor of the myocardium with occasional marked pulmonary congestion. Necrotizing nonsuppurative myocarditis was consistently present. EMCV was isolated from only one of 54 feral rodents examined. No antibodies to EMCV were detected with a serum neutralization test in 79 stored sera from a wide variety of zoo mammals. Titers of 1:16, 1:16, and 1:4 were recorded for a spider monkey (Aeteles geoffroyi), a lion (Panthera leo), and an orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), respectively. Of seven mandrills tested in 1988, six had measurable virus titers. Later testing indicated that these titers did not persist, and one mandrill with a titer > 1:128 in 1988 subsequently succumbed to EMCV infection in 1991.

      A herpesvirus was recovered in culture from the cells of a roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) following cryopreservation in DMSO and it is thought that the DMSO may have been involved in reactivation. The virus was shown to be antigenically related to alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV-1) of wildebeest and ovine herpesvirus-2 (OHV-2) of domestic sheep (formerly designated the sheep-associated agent of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF]. Cloned DNA fragments of AHV-1 and OHV-2 cross hybridised with DNA prepared from cells infected with the roan antelope virus and the intensity of reaction suggested that this virus was more closely related to AHV-1 than is OHV-2. The virus represents the third gamma herpesvirus isolated from large African antelope and should be provisionally designated hippotragine herpesvirus-1. On inoculation into rabbits the virus induced malignant catarrhal fever indicating that roan antelope should be considered as a possible source of infection.

      A virus that could not be identified as a previously known equine virus was isolated from the mononuclear cells of a horse. Electron microscopy revealed enveloped virions with nucleocapsid structures characteristic of viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family. The virus failed to hemabsorb chicken or guinea pig red blood cells and lacked neuraminidase activity. Two viral genes were isolated from a cDNA expression library. Multiple sequence alignments of one gene indicated an average identity of 45% as compared to Morbillivirus N protein sequences. A weaker relationship was found with Tupaia paramyxovirus (TPMV) and Hendra virus (HeV) N proteins. In the second gene, multiple open reading frames (ORFs) were identified, corresponding to the arrangement of the P, V, and C ORFs in the Morbillivirus and Respirovirus viruses. Short stretches in the C-terminal regions of the P and C proteins showed limited homologies to viruses in the Morbillivirus genus but no obvious relationship to viruses in other genera. The V ORF translation product contained a highly conserved, cysteine-rich domain that is common to most viruses in the Paramyxovirinae subfamily. Sequencing of P gene cDNA clones confirmed the use of a cotranscriptional editing mechanism for the regulation of P/V expression. Based on the location of its origin it has been named Salem virus (SalV).

      We report an infection with Tula virus in June 2015, leading to hospitalisation, in a patient living approximately 60 km east of Paris with no previous remarkable medical history. Clinical symptoms were limited to a fever syndrome with severe headache. The main laboratory findings included thrombocytopenia and elevated transaminase levels. Based on S (small) gene sequence analysis, the strain affecting the patient was closely related to strains detected in Central Europe, especially to a south-east German strain.

      Sera from more than 100 alpacas (Lama pacos) from the Peruvian southern sierra were examined for antibodies to 8 viruses known to infect other domestic animals. On the basis of these serologic findings and previously published serologic or clinical data, it is now known that the alpaca can be infected with the following viruses: parainfluenza-3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine herpesvirus-1, bluetongue virus, border disease virus, influenza A virus, rotavirus, rabies virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and contagious ecthyma virus.

      Phylogenetic analysis of partial phosphoprotein and glycoprotein gene sequences showed that a single genetic lineage of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) serotype New Jersey (NJ) caused the 1995 and 1997 outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis (VS) in the western United States. While distinct from VSV-NJ strains causing previous outbreaks in the western United States and those circulating in feral swine in the southeastern United States, this lineage was closely related to viral lineages circulating in the Mexican states of Guerrero, Veracruz, and Oaxaca in 1996, 1989, and 1984 respectively. In 1997 and 1998, VSV serotype Indiana 1 (IN1) re-emerged in the western United States after 30 years. Viruses causing these outbreaks grouped within a single genetic lineage distinct from VSV-IN1 isolates causing outbreaks in the western United States in 1929 and 1956 but closely related to a strain circulating in the state of Colima in central Mexico in 1997. Our data showed that sporadic VS outbreaks in the western United States are caused by genetically distinct viral lineages closer to those circulating in enzootic areas of central and southern Mexico than to those causing previous outbreaks in the United States. The genetic evidence and temporal distribution of outbreaks are not consistent with a pattern of long-term maintenance of VSV in the western United States.

      A pestivirus, isolated from pigs with haemorrhagic lesions, was antigenically more similar to border disease (BD) virus than to either hog cholera (HC) or bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD) viruses. After reverse transcription the genome at the 5' end, along with the same region from a BD isolate from sheep, was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The region of the p20 gene was sequenced and compared with published data for BVD and HC viruses. A number of motifs were conserved in the amino acid sequences of all the viruses. The pig isolate had a greater degree of homology in this region with the BD isolate (87%) than with BVD (73%) or HC (74%) viruses. This further confirms the BD-like nature of the virus.

      Serum samples obtained from 38 free-ranging Florida panthers (Felis concolor coryi) in southern Florida, March 1978 through February 1991, were tested for antibodies against eight bacterial, parasitic, and viral disease agents. Sera were positive for antibodies against feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) (78%), feline calicivirus (56%), feline immunodeficiency virus/puma lentivirus (37%), feline enteric coronavirus/feline infectious peritonitis virus (19%), and Toxoplasma gondii (9%). All samples were seronegative for Brucella spp., feline rhinotracheitis virus, and pseudorabies virus. In addition, all the animals tested were negative for feline leukemia virus p27 antigen as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Feline panleukopenia virus was considered to be a potentially significant disease agent; FPV antibodies occurred in the highest prevalences in older age classes (P = 0.027) and in panthers living in the dense mixed hardwood swamps in the western portion of their range compared to the open cypress and sawgrass prairies to the east (P = 0.096). Because < 50 animals remain in this relict population and the probable resultant depression of genetic diversity and lowered disease resistance, FPV or other disease agents could contribute to the extinction of this endangered subspecies.

      Canine distemper virus (CDV) is thought to have caused several fatal epidemics in canids within the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem of East Africa, affecting silver-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis) in 1978 (ref. 1), and African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in 1991 (refs 2, 3). The large, closely monitored Serengeti lion population was not affected in these epidemics. However, an epidemic caused by a morbillivirus closely related to CDV emerged abruptly in the lion population of the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, in early 1994, resulting in fatal neurological disease characterized by grand mal seizures and myoclonus; the lions that died had encephalitis and pneumonia. Here we report the identification of CDV from these lions, and the close phylogenetic relationship between CDV isolates from lions and domestic dogs. By August 1994, 85% of the Serengeti lion population had anti-CDV antibodies, and the epidemic spread north to lions in the Maasai Mara National reserve, Kenya, and uncounted hyaenas, bat-eared foxes, and leopards were also affected.

      Numerous rodents were trapped for serologic and virologic studies following the identification of a hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) case in Dade County, Florida. Cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) were the most frequently capture rodent and displayed the highest seroprevalence to a variety of hantavirus antigens. Hantavirus genome RNA was detected in all the seropositive cotton rats tested, using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. A virus was isolated from tissues of two seropositive cotton rats by cultivation of lung and spleen homogenates on Vero E6 cells. Nucleotide sequence information obtained by direct RT-PCR and the serologic relationships of this virus with the other hantaviruses indicate that this virus, Black Creek Canal virus, represents a new hantavirus distinct from the previously known serotypes.

      Serosurveys were conducted to obtain flavivirus and West Nile virus (WNV) seroprevalence data from mammals. Sera from 513 small- and medium-sized mammals collected during late summer and fall 2003 from Colorado, Louisiana, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania were screened for flavivirus-specific antibodies. Sera samples containing antibody to flaviviruses were screened for WNV-specific antibodies by epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and confirmed with plaque reduction neutralization tests. Prevalence of WNV antibodies among study sites ranged from 0% to 42.8% among the mammal communities sampled. High prevalence rates for WNV were noted among raccoons (100%, with a very small sample size, N = 2), Virginia opossums (50.0%), fox squirrels (49.1%), and eastern gray squirrels (48.3%). The high WNV antibody prevalence noted for tree squirrels, the peri-domestic tendencies of several of these species, and their ease of observation could make these species useful sentinels for monitoring WNV activity within urban communities.

      Twenty-seven kids aged 5-7 days from a flock of 200 goats in which a high rate of abortion occurred died over a 2-month period. All showed hyperthermia, abdominal pain and anorexia. Two of the kids were examined post mortem. Ulcerative and necrotic lesions affected the whole intestine, and macroscopical changes were also observed in the lungs, urinary bladder and liver. Histologically, a severe necrotizing enteritis as well as thickening of the alveolar septa and necrotic bronchiolo-alveolitis were detected. Prominent microscopical lesions were also present in the liver, urinary bladder, spleen, thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes and kidney. Macrophages containing eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies appeared to be the main inflammatory cell in all the organs examined. Ultrastructurally, herpesvirus particles were evident. Characteristic morphological features of type-A capsids (empty), type-C capsids (large core), and type-B capsids were observed. A virus was isolated in cell culture from all organs examined in the two kids. Cytopathogenic effects (rounding cells, syncytia, vacuoles, cell lysis) and acidophilic intranuclear inclusions typical of herpesvirus infection were observed. The virus was identified as caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and by serum neutralization

      Following the occurrence of the first laboratory-confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Maranhao State, Brazil, rodents were trapped and rodent materials screened by ELISA for antibodies to Sin Nombre and Andes hantaviruses. Antibody-positive samples were tested by RT-PCR, amplified products were sequenced, and phylogenetic trees were constructed for comparison with known hantaviruses. From 104 rodent blood samples collected (40 Bolomys lasiurus, 52 Holochilus sciureus, 12 Oligoryzomys fornesi, and one Proechimys guyannensis), 21 (20.2%) were antibody-positive (one B. lasiurus, five O. fornesi, and 15 H. sciureus). Hantavirus RNA was amplified by PCR from two O. fornesi and four H. sciureus. Viral sequencing identified two hantavirus genotypes. The genotype recovered from O. fornesi, is designated herein as Anajatuba (ANAJ) and the genotype recovered from H. sciureus is designated Rio Mearim (RIME). Phylogenetic analysis of a 643-nucleotide region of the N segment showed both viruses to be most closely related (94-96% nucleotide homology) to Río Mamoré virus, a virus associated with Oligoryzomys microtis in Bolivia and Peru, but not found in northern Brazil. O. fornesi was frequently captured in and around human dwellings. H. sciureus, is a semi-aquatic rodent captured only in remote areas rarely frequented by humans.

      THREE PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN COMPARED FOR USEFULNESS IN TITRATION AND DETECTION OF POLYOMA VIRUS: production of cytopathic effect (CPE) in mouse embryo tissue culture, production of HI antibody after inoculation into weanling mice (MAP test), and production of tumors in suckling hamsters during a 3 to 5 week observation period. The tissue culture and mouse antibody production tests were generally comparable in sensitivity, reproducibility, and time required to obtain results. Titration by tumor production in suckling hamsters was not suitable for quantitation because of marked variation in susceptibility among animals. Virus was detected in tissues of normal mice from spontaneously infected colonies by either production of CPE in mouse embryo tissue culture or by the MAP test; virus was found in organs of 15 (58 per cent) of 26 mice with antibody, and 2 (8 per cent) of 24 mice without antibody.

      Adenoviruses are important human pathogens that have been developed as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines. Previous studies indicated that human infections with adenoviruses are self-limiting in immunocompetent hosts with evidence of some persistence in adenoid tissue. We sought to better understand the natural history of adenovirus infections in various non-human primates and discovered that healthy populations of great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in stool. Shedding in stools from asymptomatic humans was found to be much less frequent, comparable to frequencies reported before. We purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques. Analyses of the new ape adenovirus sequences (as well as the 4 chimpanzee adenovirus sequences we have previously reported) together with 22 complete adenovirus genomes available from GenBank revealed that (a) the ape adenoviruses could clearly be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E, (b) there was evidence for intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses, and (c) the high degree of phylogenetic relatedness of adenoviruses across their various primate hosts provided evidence for cross species transmission events to have occurred in the natural history of B and E viruses. The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrants caution for primate handling and housing. Furthermore, the presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors.

      Bovine Herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) is distributed worldwide and is a major pathogen in cattle, being the causal agent of a variety of clinical syndromes. The aim of this study was to isolate and to characterize (molecular and biological characterization) BoHV-1 from 29 immunosuppressed animals. It was possible to obtain 18 isolates, each from a different animal, such as from the respiratory and reproductive tracts. In some cases the cytopathic effect was visible 12 hours post-inoculation, and became characteristic after 36-48 hours. Biological characteristics were evaluated and compared with Iowa and Colorado-1 reference strains, and differences were found in plaque size, virus titer measured by TCID50 and PFU/mL, and one step virus curves. These results showed that some isolates had a highly virulent-like behavior in vitro, compared to the reference strains, with shorter eclipse periods, faster release of virus into the supernatants, and higher burst size and viral titer. There were no differences in glycoprotein expression of BoHV-1 isolates, measured by Western blot on monolayers. Moreover, using restriction endonucleases analysis, most of the viruses were confirmed as BoHV-1.1 and just one of them was confirmed as BoHV-1.2a subtype. These findings suggest that some wild-type BoHV-1 isolates could be useful as seeds to develop new monovalent vaccines.

      Entomologic and virologic factors were investigated to determine whether gray-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) from Indooroopilly Island, Brisbane, Australia could be vertebrate hosts of Ross River (RR) virus. Aedes funereus was the most abundant mosquito species with 6,300-38,700 females per light trap night in the flying fox camp containing gray-headed, black (P. alecto), and little red (P. scapulatus) flying foxes. Sixteen Ae. funereus blood meals from this collection were analyzed by hemoglobin electrophoresis and were found to be from P. alecto. From pledget feeding with RR virus, the infectious dose required to infect 50% of wild caught Ae. funereus was log10 4.2 50% tissue culture infectious doses per mosquito, with a transmission rate to mice of 17% at 9-10 days post infection. Experimental infection of 10 juvenile P. poliocephalus produced viremias of low titer in five animals, with a duration of 1-4 days and a mean of two days. Three percent of colonized Ae. vigilax that fed on the 10 animals during this period became infected. One of the five viremic flying foxes and two of the five aviremic animals produced a detectable immune response by either neutralization or hemagglutination-inhibition tests. Based on the low to moderate vector competence of Ae. funereus for RR virus, and evidence that P. poliocephalus is a poor vertebrate host of RR virus, it is unlikely that RR virus transmission would be maintained between these two species, but it could be maintained by other more competent vector/host pairs.

      Hepatitis B viruses (HBVs) represent a serious public health problem affecting 350 to 400 million HBV carriers worldwide. The virus does not exclusively infect humans, but can also be found in non-human primates as in the families Hominidae (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan) and Hylobatidae (gibbon), which are distributed over Africa (chimpanzee and gorilla) and Southeast Asia (orangutan and gibbon), the endemic areas of human HBV. The prevalence of asymptomatic HBV carriers reaches in gibbons 23-33% and in orangutans 15%. The genome organization of non-human primate HBVs is nearly identical to that of human HBVs. Because of this close similarity, the question of cross-transmission of HBV between species has arisen. There are many data on cross-transmission of human HBVs to the non-human primates. However, a cross-transmission of HBVs from non-human primates to humans has not been reported yet. Using more advanced diagnostic methods, the non-human primates have increasingly been identified as a reservoir of several viruses such as lymphocryptoviruses, Cercopithecine herpesvirus 1 (CeHV-1), Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), Simian foamy virus (SFV), and HBVs. Thus veterinarians, zookeepers, or people in close contact with non-human primates may potentially become infected with those viruses causing severe diseases. Enhanced awareness of prevalence, genetic relatedness and evolution of non-human primate HBVs will help prevent further spread and cross-transmission of these viruses between humans and non-human primates.

      Hepatitis A virus (HAV) can infect not only humans but also several other nonhuman primates. This study has been conducted to evaluate the comprehensive anti-HAV seroprevalence in captive nonhuman primate populations in Thailand. The prevalence of antibodies against HAV in 96 captive nonhuman primates of 11 species was evaluated by competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA). HAV antibodies were found in 64.7% (11/17) of macaques, 85.7% (6/7) of langurs, 28.4% (10/35) of gibbons, and 94.6% (35/37) of orangutans. However, anti-HAV IgM was not found in any sera. These results indicate that the majority of captive nonhuman primates in Thailand were exposed to HAV. It is possible that some of the animals were infected prior to capture.

      The epidemiology of rabies in southern Africa is complex, due to a large number of vector species and the presence of at least two distinct biotypes of the virus. Our objective was to contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of rabies in the southern African subcontinent by studying the genetic relationship of 89 rabies virus isolates from this region. In this study, we have focused on an analysis of viruses that cycle in canid host species (canid biotype) throughout South Africa and Zimbabwe. By phylogenetic analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein and the non-coding G-L intergenic region, all the southern African canid viruses were found to be closely related and no apparent general distinction could be made between them. Although there was a minor degree of phylogenetic branching, with certain branches associated with cycles defined by species, location and time, the phylogenetic pattern indicated that canid rabies in southern Africa is derived from a single virus lineage, which has spread opportunistically within whatever canid host population is ecologically capable of sustaining prolonged cycles. This molecular epidemiological study presents the first comprehensive comparison of rabies viruses from South Africa and Zimbabwe and has demonstrated the need for multinational approaches towards the control of this important zoonotic disease in Africa.

      We recently identified 2 Mokola viruses from domestic mammals (a dog and a cat) in South Africa. These cases occurred 8 years after the last reported case of infection with this virus. Our findings emphasize the endemicity of rabies-related lyssaviruses in South Africa and the need to better understand the epidemiology of Mokola viruses.

      Enteroviruses (EVs) infecting African Non-Human Primates (NHP) are still poorly documented. This study was designed to characterize the genetic diversity of EVs among captive and wild NHP in Cameroon and to compare this diversity with that found in humans. Stool specimens were collected in April 2008 in NHP housed in sanctuaries in Yaounde and neighborhoods. Moreover, stool specimens collected from wild NHP from June 2006 to October 2008 in the southern rain forest of Cameroon were considered. RNAs purified directly from stool samples were screened for EVs using a sensitive RT-nested PCR targeting the VP1 capsid coding gene whose nucleotide sequence was used for molecular typing. Captive chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) were primarily infected by EV types already reported in humans in Cameroon and elsewhere: Coxsackievirus A13 and A24, Echovirus 15 and 29, and EV-B82. Moreover EV-A119, a novel virus type recently described in humans in central and west Africa, was also found in a captive Chimpanzee. EV-A76, which is a widespread virus in humans, was identified in wild chimpanzees, thus suggesting its adaptation and parallel circulation in human and NHP populations in Cameroon. Interestingly, some EVs harbored by wild NHP were genetically distinct from all existing types and were thus assigned as new types. One chimpanzee-derived virus was tentatively assigned as EV-J121 in the EV-J species. In addition, two EVs from wild monkeys provisionally registered as EV-122 and EV-123 were found to belong to a candidate new species. Overall, this study indicates that the genetic diversity of EVs among NHP is more important than previously known and could be the source of future new emerging human viral diseases.

      Canine distemper virus (CDV) has recently expanded its host range to nonhuman primates. A large CDV outbreak occurred in rhesus monkeys at a breeding farm in Guangxi Province, China, in 2006, followed by another outbreak in rhesus monkeys at an animal center in Beijing in 2008. In 2008 in Japan, a CDV outbreak also occurred in cynomolgus monkeys imported from China. In that outbreak, 46 monkeys died from severe pneumonia during a quarantine period. A CDV strain (CYN07-dV) was isolated in Vero cells expressing dog signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM). Phylogenic analysis showed that CYN07-dV was closely related to the recent CDV outbreaks in China, suggesting continuing chains of CDV infection in monkeys. In vitro, CYN07-dV uses macaca SLAM and macaca nectin4 as receptors as efficiently as dog SLAM and dog nectin4, respectively. CYN07-dV showed high virulence in experimentally infected cynomolgus monkeys and excreted progeny viruses in oral fluid and feces. These data revealed that some of the CDV strains, like CYN07-dV, have the potential to cause acute systemic infection in monkeys.

      A male orangutan suffered from ulcers at the buccal mucosa. We obtained swab fluid from the base of both vesicles and ulcers and collected blood for further separation into serum, plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for detection of antibody to herpesvirus by serology and herpesvirus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using consensus degenerate primers. Serology was positive for human EBV IgG but negative for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) immunoglobulin (IgM), as well as for both human cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus IgG and IgM. Upon PCR, we obtained a 232-bp product of virus DNA from PBMC, but not from lesions, serum or plasma. We confirmed the positive result by direct sequencing and compared the nucleotide sequence with other nucleotide sequences applying the BLAST program from GenBank. The sequence was similar to lymphocryptovirus of macaque (93%), marmoset (93%), gorilla (90%) and human EBV (90%). We aligned this sequence with other sequences in GenBank and performed phylogenetic analysis, showing that it probably belongs to the gammaherpesvirus group.

      Venezuelan Haemorrhagic Fever is an endemic zoonosis exhibiting a high lethality. Discovered decades ago, it is still causing seasonal hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. With the ongoing migration crisis, transmission and spreading to other countries in Latin America remains a latent threat that should be monitored, particularly in light of recent cases.

      To investigate if non-hematophagous bats play a role in outbreaks of rabies and blue eye disease (LPMV), we studied the seroprevalence against both agents in several species of non-hematophagous bats on the sub-tropical Pacific coast of the state of Colima, Mexico. The survey covered a predominantly agricultural area (disturbed), and an area dominated by semideciduous dry forest (undisturbed). A total of 151 non-hematophagous bats of 16 species were captured from the two areas. Fifty-six (37%) had antirabic antibodies (Ab) while 87 (58%) did not and 8 samples (5%) had to be discarded because of hemolysis. A much lower (P<0.05) prevalence of antirabic Ab was found in bats caught in disturbed areas (22.7%) compared with those from undisturbed areas (51.9%). The presence of antirabic Ab was not related to sex, genera or feeding habits. The higher prevalence found in bats in the undisturbed area may be the result of more frequent interspecies encounters. Of the 108 sera analyzed for antibodies against LPMV, only one was positive (a male Rhogeessa parvula major, captured in the undisturbed area). This suggests that bats in the surveyed localities do not play a role in the epidemiology of LPMV.

      Five hundred fifty-six samples representing 24 species of small mammals (two species of marsupials and 22 rodents) were collected in Panama between February 2000 and July 2002. The samples were examined for antibodies to hantaviruses by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or immunoblot assays. The serologic results indicated that several rodent species might act as hantaviral reservoirs in Panama: Costa Rican pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys fulvescens costaricensis), four positive of 72 tested (5.6%); Cherrie's cane rat (Zygodontomys brevicauda cherriei), five of 108 (4.6%); Mexican deer mouse (Peromyscus mexicanus), one of 22 (5%); Mexican harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys mexicanus), one of seven (14%); Chiriquí harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys creper), one of two (50%); and Sumichrast's harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys sumichrasti), three of four (75%). Hantavirus infection in Peromyscus mexicanus and the three species of Reithrodontomys was caused by Rio Segundo hantavirus, a species of virus not previously reported from Panama. At least three hantaviruses, therefore, are known to infect populations of wild rodents in the country. However, given the total number of animals tested, the role of these rodent species in the epidemiology and epizootiology of hantavirus infections remains unclear.

      Ljungan virus is a recently identified member of the family Picornaviridae that was isolated from bank voles in Sweden. LjV has been associated with [corrected] type 1 diabetes-like symptoms and myocarditis in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), and it has been suggested that it has zoonotic potential. Here, we show for the first time that Ljungan virus is prevalent (20-27 % positive by PCR) in four species of UK rodent (Myodes glareolus [bank vole], Apodemus sylvaticus [wood mouse], Microtus agrestis [field vole] and Mus musculus [house mouse]). Sequence analysis showed that Ljungan virus of genotypes 1 and 2 were present, although genotype 1 was more prevalent and more frequently associated with brain tissue. This study highlights the prevalence of Ljungan virus in the UK and the need for assessment [corrected] of its zoonotic potential.

      A total of 1,397 rodents of 7 different species were collected in the major vegetative zones of Senegal. Organ pools from rodents were inoculated into suckling-mice. Thirty-five viral strains, representing 5 viruses, were isolated. The 5 viral types recovered in the present survey comprise: Bandia (23 strains), Saboya (7), Salanga (3), Gabek Forest (1) and a new poxvirus (AnD 42332) for which the name of Fadiga is proposed. This virus was isolated from a Mastomys sp collected in eastern Senegal. Antigenic relations were established by complement fixation test with Salanga virus; its distinctness was determined by neutralisation test. Our data are discussed with compiled informations on the current status of rodent viral isolations in West and Central Africa.

      An outbreak of Aujeszky's disease (AD) occurred in a herd of domestic animals that led to the death of seven cattle, three goats, three sheep, two cats and one dog, all of them with CNS signs. The animals were not in direct contact with swine. The ADV was detected in the tissue of affected animals by celi culture methods and PCR. Genome strains of ADV were characterized by restriction endonuclease analysis using BamH I. The results indicated that the strains of virus were identical and belonged to the type genome I of AD. Compared with vaccine and isolated strains obtained from the pig in the same region, considerable differences in DNA patterns were detected. Interestingly, the strains isolated from the dead animals were similar to Buk T-900 reference strains.

      Sera from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were collected in Iowa during the winter months (1999-2003), 2 years before and after West Nile virus (WNV) was first reported in Iowa (2001), and were analyzed for antibodies to WNV. Samples from 1999 to 2001 were antibody negative by blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (bELISA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT(90)). Prevalence derived from bELISA (2002, 12.7%; 2003, 11.2%) and WNV PRNT(90) (2002, 7.9%; 2003, 8.5%) assays were similar. All samples were negative for antibodies against St. Louis encephalitis virus as determined by PRNT(90). Antibodies to flaviviruses were detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) prior to the first WNV cases reported in Iowa (1999-2001) with prevalence ranging from 2.2% to 3.2%, suggesting the circulation of an additional undescribed flavivirus prior to the introduction of WNV into the area. Flavivirus prevalence as determined by iELISA increased in 2002 and 2003 (23.3% and 31.9%, respectively). The increase in prevalence exceeded estimates of WNV prevalence, suggesting that conditions favored general flavivirus transmission (including WNV) during the 2002-2003 epizootic. These data indicate that serologic analysis of deer sera collected from hunter harvests may prove useful for surveillance and evidence of local transmission of WNV and other pathogens and identify white-tailed deer as a species for further studies for host competency.

      A serological investigation by means of an enzyme immuno assay test for herpes B virus (cercopithecine herpesvirus 1) was performed on 961 sera of healthy nonhuman primates reared in laboratory animal facilities which belong to the Association of Laboratory Animal Facilities of the National University of Japan. An antibody prevalence of 40% (384/ 961) was demonstrated. The antibody titer was shown to be higher among macaques (60% of cynomolgus monkeys, 53% of rhesus monkeys, and 34% of Japanese monkeys) than among non-macaque species (21%). These data indicate that nonhuman primates reared in animal facilities may present an occupational health problem and a potential zoonotic biohazard as demonstrated in limited cases in the United States.

      Human rhinoviruses (HRVs; family Picornaviridae), the most frequent causative agents of respiratory infections, comprise more than 100 distinct serotypes. According to previous phylogenetic analysis of the VP4/VP2-coding sequences, all but one of the HRV prototype strains distribute between the two established species, Human rhinovirus A (HRV-A) and Human rhinovirus B (HRV-B). Here, partial sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D polymerase)-coding gene of 48 HRV prototype strains and 12 field isolates were analysed. The designated division of the HRV strains into the species HRV-A and HRV-B was also seen in the 3D-coding region. Phylogenetically, HRV-B clustered closer to human enterovirus (HEV) species HEV-B, HEV-C and poliovirus than to HRV-A. Intraspecies variation within both HRV-A and HRV-B was greater in the 3D-coding region than in the VP4/VP2-coding region, with the difference maxima reaching 48 % at the nucleotide level and 36 % at the amino acid level in HRV-A and 53 and 35 %, respectively, in HRV-B. Within both species, a few strains formed a separate cluster differing from the majority of strains as much as HEV-B from HEV-C. Furthermore, the tree topology within HRV-A differed from that for VP4/VP2, suggesting possible recombination events in the evolutionary history of the strains. However, all 12 field isolates clustered similarly, as in the capsid region. These results showed that the within-species variation in the 3D region is greater in HRV than in HEV. Furthermore, HRV variation in the 3D region exceeds that in the capsid-coding region.

      Recent reports of novel hantaviruses in shrews and moles and the detection of rodent-borne hantaviruses in different rodent species raise important questions about their host range and specificity, evolution, and host adaptation. Tula virus (TULV), a European hantavirus, is believed to be slightly or non-pathogenic in humans and was initially detected in the common vole Microtus arvalis, the East European vole M. levis (formerly rossiaemeridionalis), and subsequently in other Microtus species. Here we report the first multiple RT-PCR detection and sequence analyses of TULV in the Eurasian water vole Arvicola amphibius from different regions in Germany and Switzerland. Additional novel TULV S-, M-, and L-segment sequences were obtained from M. arvalis and M. agrestis trapped in Germany at sites close to trapping sites of TULV-RT-PCR-positive water voles. Serological investigations using a recombinant TULV nucleocapsid protein revealed the presence of TULV-reactive antibodies in RT-PCR-positive and a few RT-PCR-negative water voles. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a geographical clustering of the novel S-, M-, and L-segment sequences from A. amphibius with those of M. arvalis- and M. agrestis-derived TULV lineages, and may suggest multiple TULV spillover or a potential host switch to A. amphibius. Future longitudinal studies of sympatric Microtus and Arvicola populations and experimental infection studies have to prove the potential of A. amphibius as an additional TULV reservoir host.

      To examine the host association of Tula virus (TULV), a hantavirus present in large parts of Europe, we investigated a total of 791 rodents representing 469 Microtus arvalis and 322 Microtus agrestis animals from northeast, northwest, and southeast Germany, including geographical regions with sympatric occurrence of both vole species, for the presence of TULV infections. Based on serological investigation, reverse transcriptase PCR, and subsequent sequence analysis of partial small (S) and medium (M) segments, we herein show that TULV is carried not only by its commonly known host M. arvalis but also frequently by M. agrestis in different regions of Germany for a prolonged time period. At one trapping site, TULV was exclusively detected in M. agrestis, suggesting an isolated transmission cycle in this rodent reservoir separate from spillover infections of TULV-carrying M. arvalis. Phylogenetic analysis of the S and M segment sequences demonstrated geographical clustering of the TULV sequences irrespective of the host, M. arvalis or M. agrestis. The novel TULV lineages from northeast, northwest, and southeast Germany described here are clearly separated from each other and from other German, European, or Asian lineages, suggesting their stable geographical localization and fast sequence evolution. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that TULV represents a promiscuous hantavirus with a large panel of susceptible hosts. In addition, this may suggest an alternative evolution mode, other than a strict coevolution, for this virus in its Microtus hosts, which should be proven in further large-scale investigations on sympatric Microtus hosts.

      The members of the family Adenoviridae are widely spread among vertebrate host species and normally cause acute but innocuous infections. Special attention is focused on adenoviruses because of their ability to transform host cells, their possible application in vector technology, and their phylogeny. The primary structure of the genome of Tupaia adenovirus (TAV), which infects Tupaia spp. (tree shrew) was determined. Tree shrews are taxonomically assumed to be at the base of the phylogenetic tree of mammals and are frequently used as laboratory animals in neurological and behavior research. The TAV genome is 33,501 bp in length with a G+C content of 49.96% and has 166-bp inverted terminal repeats. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence resulted in the identification of 109 open reading frames (ORFs) with a coding capacity of at least 40 amino acid residues. Thirty-eight of them are predicted to encode viral proteins based on the presence of transcription and translation signals and sequence and positional conservation. Thirty viral ORFs were found to show significant similarities to known adenoviral genes, arranged into discrete early and late genome regions as they are known from mastadenoviruses. Analysis of the nucleotide content of the TAV genome revealed a significant CG dinucleotide depletion at the genome ends that suggests methylation of these genomic regions during the viral life cycle. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral gene products, including penton and hexon proteins, viral protease, terminal protein, protein VIII, DNA polymerase, protein IVa2, and 100,000-molecular-weight protein, revealed that the evolutionary lineage of TAV forms a separate branch within the phylogenetic tree of the Mastadenovirus genus.

      Three bison herds in Colorado experienced high mortality from malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). In comparison with cattle, the bison had a more rapidly progressive disease, fewer clinical signs, and milder inflammatory histologic lesions. There was consistent association with ovine herpesvirus-2 (OHV-2). Contact with sheep was not consistent. Of 17 animals in herd A, 15 died of acute MCF; 1 was slaughtered while healthy; and 1 developed clinical signs of MCF, was treated with corticosteroids and antibiotics, and died of fungal abomasitis and rhinitis after 5 months. In herds B and C, approximately 300 of 900 and 18 of 20 died of MCF following brief clinical disease. The nearest sheep were 1 mile away from herd A, but direct contact with sheep could be documented in herds B and C. Complete gross and histologic examinations were conducted on 34 animals, including all animals in herd A, and MCF was diagnosed in 31. In addition, field necropsies were performed on all dead animals in herd B and most in herd C and MCF was diagnosed on the basis of the gross lesions in most animals. Clinical signs of each animal in herd A were recorded. Illness was brief, usually 8-48 hours. Clinical signs were subtle; separation from the herd was often observed. In all 3 herds, hemorrhagic cystitis and multifocal ulceration of the alimentary tract were consistently found at necropsy. Mild lymphocytic vasculitis was present in multiple organs. Ovine herpesvirus-2 was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 71 of 105 formalin-fixed tissue specimens from 29 of 31 animals with MCF. In herd A, blood samples from 13 animals were collected at 5 time points and tested by PCR for the presence of OHV-2 viral sequences in peripheral blood leukocytes. Nine bison with a positive PCR test and 4 with negative results prior to clinical illness died of MCF.

      Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) was diagnosed in four free-ranging mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in January and February of 2003. Diagnosis was based on typical histologic lesions of lymphocytic vasculitis and PCR identification of ovine herpesvirus-2 (OHV-2) viral genetic sequences in formalin-fixed tissues. The animals were from the Uncompahgre Plateau of southwestern Colorado. Deer from these herds occasionally resided in close proximity to domestic sheep (Ovis aries), the reservoir host of OHV-2, in agricultural valleys adjacent to their winter range. These cases indicate that fatal OHV-2 associated MCF can occur in free-ranging mule deer exposed to domestic sheep that overlap their range.

      Sin Nombre virus (SNV) is the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). SNV RNA can be detected in fresh or frozen autopsy tissue samples by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and virus antigens can be identified by immunohistochemistry. A method was developed for demonstration of SNV RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues by RT-PCR. Virus genomes were detected in 8 of 12 (66.7%) fixed human tissue samples that were positive by immunohistochemistry, and RT-PCR prior to tissue fixation. By comparison with nucleotide sequences determined previously in fresh or frozen tissues of the same patients, identical genomic sequences were obtained, proving the authenticity of the PCR products. The study demonstrates that detection of SNV RNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival tissue by RT-PCR is feasible. This method allows retrospective studies on the phylogenetic epidemiology of SNV in North America.

      Foamy viruses (FVs) persist in healthy individuals of various mammalian species, including nonhuman primates. Laboratory markers of FV infection are (1) virus in throat epithelium or peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), (2) proviral DNA sequences in PBLs and various solid organs, and (3) antibodies reactive to viral antigens on Western blots, in radioimmunoprecipitation tests, and in immunofluorescence assays. Using PCR and serological tests, we readily detected FV markers in naturally infected African green monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees, as well as in accidentally infected humans. Transmission of simian foamy viruses to humans (by bite or inadvertent laboratory infection) leads to viral markers, without affecting the recipient. Reports on FV-associated clinical disorders (e.g., thyroid or neurological) have remained controversial. In this study we failed to detect, by PCR, viral sequences in the samples from 223 patients, including 16 HIV-infected Africans, 46 Graves' disease patients, and 28 patients with the de Quervain's thyroiditis. Evaluation of 2688 sera from suspected high-risk areas (e.g., Central and East Africa, or high-risk groups such as HIV-infected individuals and patients with AIDS, thyroid, and neurological disorders) did not reveal FV-specific antibodies in a single case. Previously reported FV seroprevalence in various populations has never been verified by appropriate confirmatory tests. The strain of ""human foamy virus"" has remained a unique isolate. In conclusion, FVs are unlikely--at present--to circulate in human populations.

      The pathological changes found in four Abyssinian Colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza) dying of measles are described. Warthin-Finkeldey giant cells were plentiful in the lymphoid tissue and spleen, in the mucosa of the alimentary tract and in the lungs, where they accompanied a non-suppurative pneumonia. In the alimentary tract they were most frequent in the colon when an associated colitis was present. Measles virus was recovered from the lung tissue of one animal, the virus being neutralised by both human and rhesus monkey anti-sera. This together with the close similarity between the pathological changes in human and monkey measles, supports the contention that the two diseases are one and due to the same virus.

      Two strains (UB-1 and UB-2) of rabies-related viruses were isolated from the brain of Nyctalus noctula and Vespertilio murinus captured from the hollows of tall trees on the left bank of Pripyat river in the Volynsky region of Ukrainian S.S.R. The viruses were isolated by means of intracerebral inoculation to white mice. The isolates were identified as rabies-related viruses of Duvenhage type in an indirect test of fluorescent antibodies with the panels of nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies (NC Mab) provided by Wistar Institute (Philadelphia) and by Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL, Weybridge). During the typing with the Wistar panel of NC Mab complete antigenic similarity was established between the newly isolated strain and Yuli virus. The reaction with CVL NC Mab revealed group-specific antigenic similarity between Yuli virus on one hand, Duvenhage-6 and Duvenhage-66 on the other hand, as well as between UB-1 and UB-2 and Duvenhage-26. The reaction with antibodies to clones DB-3,4,6,9, and 10 detected antigenic similarity between the viruses of chiropteric origin isolated in the U.S.S.R., North-West Europe as well in Africa, although some differences were discovered. Yuli, UB-1, and UB-2 viruses isolated in the U.S.S.R. were proved to belong to Duvenhage group of viruses (serotype 4).

      From 1992 to 2000, 976 sera, 27 blood pellets, and 91 brains were obtained from 14 bat species in 37 localities in Spain. Specific anti-European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBL1)-neutralizing antibodies have been detected in Myotis myotis, Miniopterus schreibersii, Tadarida teniotis, and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in the region of Aragon and the Balearic Islands. Positive results were also obtained by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on brain, blood pellet, lung, heart, tongue, and esophagus-larynx-pharynx of M. myotis, Myotis nattereri, R. ferrumequinum, and M. schreibersii. Determination of nucleotide sequence confirmed the presence of EBL1 RNA in the different tissues. In one colony, the prevalence of seropositive bats over time corresponded to an asymmetrical curve, with a sudden initial increase peaking at 60% of the bats, followed by a gradual decline. Banded seropositive bats were recovered during several years, indicating that EBL1 infection in these bats was nonlethal. At least one of this species (M. schreibersii) is migratory and thus could be partially responsible for the dissemination of EBL1 on both shores of the Mediterranean Sea.

      A total of 80 Neotropical bats of five species was inoculated with one of four strains of Venezuelan encephalitis (VE) virus. Virus was detected in the oropharynges of 56% of bats, and most regularly in Artibeus jamaicensis (75%). Titers of virus in oropharyngeal secretions were occasionally very high (8.5 log10 SMicLD50/ml in one A. jamaicensis). Only 2 of 123 urine samples from 50 bats and 2 of 86 fecal samples from 46 bats yielded VE virus. No contact or aerosol virus transmission from bat to bat was detected. VE virus passed transplacentally from two infected mothers to their fetuses, which were aborted. Virus did not pass from one infected mother to her nursing young.

      Plasmas of sloths and other Central Panamanian wild vertebrates were tested for plaque-reduction neutralizing (PRN) antibodies against four flaviviruses and one alpha-virus. Forty percent of 97 two-toed sloths, Choloepus hoffmanni, and 8% of 168 three-toed sloths, Bradypus variegatus, were specifically positive against St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus. The prevalence of antibody against SLE virus was considerably higher in sloths than in any other group of wild vertebrates tested, including birds, and was found mainly in adult sloths. Specific PRN antibody against yellow fever (YF) virus was found only in monkeys. A high prevalence of PRN antibody against Ilheus and Mayaro viruses was detected in agoutis, Dasyprocta punctata, and against Mayaro virus in howler monkeys, Alouatta villosa. No plasma was specifically positive against Bussuquara virus. The results are interpreted as evidence that sloths are probably not important hosts in jungle YF cycles, but may be significant amplifying hosts in tropical SLE virus cycles.

      Seven virus strains were isolated in Vero cells from whole blood samples from 80 wild-caught sloths, Bradypus variegatus and Choloepus hoffmanni, from Central Panamá. Four strains of at least two different serotypes are related to Changuinola virus; two of these were associated with prolonged or recrudescent viremias. One strain is an antigenic subtype of Punta Toro virus, and another, described here as Bradypus-4 virus, is a new, antigenically ungrouped virus. A second new virus from sloths, Utive virus, forms an antigenic complex within the Simbu serogroup with Utinga and Pintupo viruses. Tests on sequential plasma samples from radio-marked free-ranging sloths and from recently captured animals maintained in captivity showed that both species develop neutralizing antibodies following naturally acquired virus infections. Antibodies against the Changuinola and Simbu serogroup viruses are widespread in both sloth species and are especially prevalent in Choloepus, but are virtually absent in all other wild vertebrate species tested.

      A mammalian survey was conducted in Mexico (October 1994-January 1996) and in Paraguay (August 1996-March 1997); a complete specimen was collected for each bat in the survey, including primary voucher specimen, ectoparasites, karyotype, and various frozen tissues. The surveys combined provided 937 brain samples (65 bat species) for rabies diagnosis. One male Lasiurus ega, collected in Paraguay, tested positive for the rabies virus (overall prevalence rate of 0.1%). Nucleotide sequence from a 300 bp region of the rabies nucleoprotein gene was compared with sequence obtained from representative rabies virus samples in the repository at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia, USA). Rabies virus extracted from the brain material of L. ega differed by only one nucleotide from a 300 bp consensus sequence (>99% homology) derived from samples for the variant of rabies virus transmitted by Lasiurus cinereus. Lasiurus ego differed by approximately 15% for the variant transmitted by Desmodus rotundus. Phylogenetic analysis found no evidence to suggest L. ego is a reservoir for rabies antigenic variant 6. The most likely explanation for rabies in L. ega was infection following contact with a rabid L. cinereus.

      Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is becoming increasingly recognized as an important human pathogen in southern Africa. In order to determine the role of wild mammals in the natural ecology of the virus, sera from 3,772 wild mammals of 87 species and from 1,978 domestic dogs collected in South Africa and Zimbabwe between 1964 and 1985 were tested for antibody to CCHF virus by reversed passive hemagglutination inhibition (RPHI) and by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Antibody was found to be highly prevalent in large mammals in the Orders Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla such as giraffe, Giraffa camelopardalis (3/3 positive), rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simium and Diceros bicornis (7/13), eland, Taurotragus oryx (59/127), buffalo, Syncerus caffer (56/287), kudu, Tragelaphus strepsiceros (17/78), and zebra, Equus burchelli (16/93). In small mammals antibody was found in the sera of 40/293 hares, 22/1,305 rodents, and 1/74 wild carnivores, but not in 522 primates, 176 insectivores, or 19 hyrax. Antibody was also found in the sera of 118/1,978 domestic dogs. The species of wild mammal in which antibody was distributed (with highest antibody prevalence in hares and large herbivores) reflects the feeding preference of immature and adult ticks of the genus Hyalomma, suggesting that Hyalomma sp. are the principal CCHF vectors in the wild.

      Eidolon helvum bats are reservoir hosts for highly pathogenic lyssaviruses often showing limited disease upon natural infection. An enhanced antiviral interferon (IFN) response combined with reduced inflammation might be linked to the apparent virus tolerance in bats. Lyssavirus phosphoproteins inhibit the IFN response with virus strain-specific efficiency. To date, little is known regarding the lyssavirus P-dependent anti-IFN countermeasures in bats, mainly due to a lack of in vitro tools. By using E. helvum bat cell cultures in a newly established bat-specific IFN-promoter activation assay, we analyzed the IFN-ß inhibitory activity of multiple lyssavirus P in E. helvum compared to human cells. Initial virus infection studies with a recently isolated E. helvum-borne Lagos bat virus street strain from Ghana showed enhanced LBV propagation in an E. helvum lung cell line compared to human A549 lung cells at later time points suggesting effective viral countermeasures against cellular defense mechanisms. A direct comparison of the IFN-ß inhibitory activity of the LBV-GH P protein with other lyssavirus P proteins showed that LBV-GH P and RVP both strongly inhibited the bat IFN-β promotor activation (range 75-90%) in EidLu/20.2 and an E. helvum kidney cell line. Conversely, LBV-GH P blocked the activation of the human IFN-β promoter less efficiently compared to a prototypic Rabies virus P protein (range LBV P 52-68% vs RVP 71-95%) in two different human cell lines (HEK-293T, A549). The same pattern was seen for two prototypic LBV P variants suggesting an overall reduced LBV P IFN-ß inhibitory activity in human cells as compared to E. helvum bat cells. Increased IFN-ß inhibition by lyssavirus P in reservoir host cells might be a result of host-specific adaptation processes towards an enhanced IFN response in bat cells.

      The critical assessment of bovine adenoviruses (BAdV) as indicators of environmental fecal contamination requires improved knowledge of their prevalence, shedding dynamics, and genetic diversity. We examined DNA extracted from bovine and other animal waste samples collected in Wisconsin for atadenoviruses and mastadenoviruses using novel, broad-spectrum PCR primer sets. BAdV were detected in 13% of cattle fecal samples, 90% of cattle urine samples, and 100% of cattle manure samples; 44 percent of BAdV-positive samples contained both Atadenovirus and Mastadenovirus DNA. Additionally, BAdV were detected in soil, runoff water from a cattle feedlot, and residential well water. Overall, we detected 8 of 11 prototype BAdV, plus bovine, rabbit, and porcine mastadenoviruses that diverged significantly from previously reported genotypes. The prevalence of BAdV shedding by cattle supports targeting AdV broadly as indicators of the presence of fecal contamination in aqueous environments. Conversely, several factors complicate the use of AdV for fecal source attribution. Animal AdV infecting a given livestock host were not monophyletic, recombination among livestock mastadenoviruses was detected, and the genetic diversity of animal AdV is still underreported. These caveats highlight the need for continuing genetic surveillance for animal AdV and for supporting data when BAdV detection is invoked for fecal source attribution in environmental samples. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report natural BAdV excretion in urine, BAdV detection in groundwater, and recombination in AdV of livestock origin.

      Between October 1991 and February 1992, 41 of 53 known adult and subadult Ethiopian wolves (Canis simensis) in five adjacent packs in the Bale Mountains National Park, Ethiopia, died or disappeared. Brain smears from two carcasses were positive for rabies by the immunofluorescence test, and rabies virus was isolated from the brains by mouse inoculation. Based on monoclonal antibody tests on the mouse brains, we identified the virus as a minor variant of the serotype 1 rabies viruses found in domestic dogs and wild canids of Africa. Sera from two of 15 Ethiopian wolves had rabies virus neutralizing antibody.

      Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) are widespread pathogens mainly associated with benign, self-limiting, cutaneous lesions (warts). At least 8 viral types, defined by serology or nucleotide sequences of the L1 gene, have been identified to date. Different serotypes are associated with the specific type and morphology of the lesion and with particular geographical regions. This article describes the molecular identification of papillomaviruses from Brazilian cattle (n = 48) and horses (n = 1) through partial amplification and sequencing of the L1 gene. Bovine papillomavirus-1 (BPV-1) was identified in warts from 29 cattle (59%), BPV-6 from 9 cattle (18%), and BPV-2 in 8 lesions (16%). Warts of 2 cattle harbored L1 sequences of a new BPV type (BAA5), otherwise identified almost exclusively in healthy skin. The newly proposed BPV type ""BR-UEL-4"" was identified in a sarcoid tumor of a horse. Thus, the present report provides information on the main types of BPV involved in bovine papillomatosis in Brazil and reveals a new viral type associated with equine sarcoid, which to date has been attributed exclusively to BPV-1 and BPV-2.

      An approximately 8-week-old pet Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) with a 1-week history of dyspnea, hyporexia, and ataxia was submitted for necropsy. On gross examination, the hamster had multiple abdominal adhesions and enlargement of the mesenteric lymph node. Histologic evaluation revealed multicentric lymphoma of the liver, jejunum, mesenteric lymph node, testicular fat pad, and epididymis. Based on the hamster's age and the type and distribution of the lymphoma, a presumptive diagnosis of hamster polyomavirus-induced lymphoma was made. A specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed, which confirmed the diagnosis. An in situ PCR demonstrated hamster polyomavirus DNA within lymphocytes of the multicentric lymphoma and renal tubular epithelial cells and within clusters of enterocytes in the jejunum. These data are consistent with environmental dissemination of hamster polyomavirus virions through the renal tubular epithelium and into the urine and with fecal shedding of hamster polyomavirus virions; however, additional studies will be needed to confirm these observations.

      The primate polyomavirus SV40 is known to cause interstitial nephritis in primary infections and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) upon reactivation of a latent infection in SIV-infected macaques. We now describe a second central nervous system manifestation of SV40: a meningoencephalitis affecting cerebral gray matter, without demyelination, distinct from PML. Meningoencephalitis appears also to be a primary manifestation of SV40 infection and can be seen in conjunction with SV40-induced interstitial nephritis and pneumonitis. The difference in the lesions of meningoencephalitis and PML does not appear to be due to cellular tropism, as both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes are infected in PML and meningoencephalitis, as determined by in situ hybridization or immunohistochemistry for SV40 coupled with immunohistochemistry for cellular determinants. This is further supported by examination of SV40 nucleic acid sequences from the ori-enhancer and large-T-antigen regions, which reveals no tissue-or lesion-specific variation in SV40 sequences.

      Cross-species transmission of retroviruses is common in Cameroon. To determine risk for simian T-cell lymphotropic virus (STLV) transmission from nonhuman primates to hunters, we examined 170 hunter-collected dried blood spots (DBS) from 12 species for STLV. PCR with generic tax and group-specific long terminal repeat primers showed that 12 (7%) specimens from 4 nonhuman primate species were infected with STLV. Phylogenetic analyses showed broad diversity of STLV, including novel STLV-1 and STLV-3 sequences and a highly divergent STLV-3 subtype found in Cercopithecus mona and C. nictitans monkeys. Screening of peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA from 63 HTLV-seroreactive, PCR-negative hunters did not identify human infections with this divergent STLV-3. Therefore, hunter-collected DBS can effectively capture STLV diversity at the point where pathogen spillover occurs. Broad screening using this relatively easy collection strategy has potential for large-scale monitoring of retrovirus cross-species transmission among highly exposed human populations.

      An agent, serologically identical to a Wyeomyia virus obtained from mosquitoes, was isolated from a worker on the inter-American highway project in Darien Province in eastern Panama. He experienced a mild febrile illness with recovery. A significant rise in anttibody titer to this virus was demonstrated in his serum during convalescence. Neutralizing antibodies to this newly isolated strain were found in 10 of 59 blood samples from inhabitants of Darien Province. The virus is designated the Darien strain.

      Bovine leukosis associated with infection with the delta retrovirus Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is endemic in many cattle herds in the United States. Infection has been associated with immunosuppression and decreased productivity. Cases of tuberculosis in cows due to infection with Mycobacterium bovis reemerged in Michigan in 1998, and despite intensive eradication attempts, new cases of bovine tuberculosis are sporadically identified. The present report details a coinfection with BLV and M. bovis in a Holstein cow from Michigan that presented as part of a bovine tuberculosis screening program. Peripheral and visceral lymph nodes of this animal were markedly enlarged, homogeneously pale white, and bulged on the cut surface. The submandibular, mesenteric, and caudal mediastinal lymph nodes contained multifocal to coalescing caseogranulomas that ranged from 1 to 5 cm in diameter. Histologically, dense sheets of monomorphic populations of neoplastic lymphocytes obliterated the normal architecture of all lymph nodes. Caseogranulomas were characterized by central pools of amorphous degenerate eosinophilic and occasionally mineralized granular debris surrounded by thick rims of epithelioid macrophages, occasional Langhan's type giant cells, and fibrosis. Polymerase chain reaction assay was positive for BLV. Cultures of affected lymph nodes yielded growth of M. bovis.

      Rabbit coronavirus (RbCV) was apparently first encountered in 1961 when Scandinavian investigators observed occasional mortality in rabbits used to propagate the Nichols strain of Treponema pallidum. Mortality rates reached 50 percent by 1968 and 75 percent by 1970. Contaminated samples of T. pallidum were brought to the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, a World Health Organization center for the study of treponematoses. There it was established that the causative agent was filterable, the heart was the target organ, and the agent was determined by electron microscopy to be a coronavirus. Also, complement fixing antibodies to the human coronaviruses 229E (two way cross) and 0C43 (one way cross) were demonstrated in surviving rabbits. Immunofluorescent staining with anti-229E serum localized fluorescence in the interstitial tissue of the myocardium. Antiserum to RbCV cross reacted with coronaviruses of three other diseases, feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV), canine coronavirus diarrhea (CCV), and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGEV) by radioimmunoassay. In plaque neutralization tests, a slight reduction was observed against TGE and CCV but not against FIP. Antiserum to 229EV, CCV, FIPV and to a lesser degree TGEV partially blocked the clinical course of the disease and reduced mortality. Slight protection was afforded rabbits by vaccination with, in descending order of survivors, CCV, FIPV, and TGEV. Vaccination with calf diarrhea coronavirus (CDCV) provided no protection.

      Bovine enteric caliciviruses (BEC) are associated with diarrhea in young calves. The BEC strains detected in Europe form a third genogroup within the genus ""Norwalk-like viruses"" (NLV) of the family Caliciviridae. In this report, we present sequence, clinical, and histological data characterizing a novel enteropathogenic BEC strain, NB, detected in fecal specimens from calves in the United States. The complete RNA genome of the NB virus is 7,453 bases long and is organized into two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF-1 is 2,210 amino acids long and encodes a large nonstructural polyprotein contiguous with the major capsid protein (VP1), similar to the lagoviruses and ""Sapporo-like viruses"" (SLV). The conserved calicivirus motifs were identified in the nonstructural proteins. ORF-2 is located at the 3' end of the genome and encodes a small basic protein (VP2) of 225 amino acids. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions are 74 and 67 bases long, respectively. Among caliciviruses, NB virus shows amino acid identities of 14.1 to 22.6% over the entire ORF-1 nonstructural-protein sequence with NLV, SLV, vesivirus, and lagovirus strains, while the overall sequence identity of the complete NB VP-1 with other caliciviruses is low, varying between 14.6 and 26.7%. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP1 protein, including strains from all four calicivirus genera, showed the closest grouping of NB virus to be with viruses in the genus Lagovirus, which cause liver infections and systemic hemorrhage in rabbits. In gnotobiotic calves, however, NB virus elicited only diarrhea and intestinal lesions that were most severe in the upper small intestine (duodenum and jejunum), similar to the NLV BEC strains. The tissues of major organs, including the lung, liver, kidney, and spleen, had no visible microscopic lesions.

      Serum-neutralizing antibodies to both vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) and San Miguel sea lion virus (SMSV) were found in a number of animal species having an association with the southern California coastal zones. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) had antibodies to 9 VESV types (A48, C52, D53, E54, F54, G55, I55, J56, and K56). Fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) and elephant seal pups (Mirounga angustirostris) were tested for antibodies to 6 VESV types and all were negative. California gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) were tested for antibodies to 9 VESV types, and sperm whale (Physeter catodon), finback whale (Balaenoptera physalus), and sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) were tested for 6 VESV types. Among the last 4 species, antibodies were present for each VESV type except C52, and all species were positive for antibodies to 2 or more VESV types. Feral swine from both Santa Cruz Island and Santa Catalina Island were tested and antibodies were present for 8 of 9 VESV types and all SMSV types except SMSV-4. One donkey from San Miguel Island was positive for VESV I55 and 2 were positive for SMSV-2.

      A survey of wild-rodent populations has revealed that murine norovirus (MNV) is present and diverse in wild-house mice Mus musculus. This virus is genetically similar to MNV infecting show mice and previously described variants circulating in laboratory mice. The detection of MNV in wild-mouse populations suggests that MNV infection of laboratory mice and show mice (from which laboratory mice are derived) derives from contact with or their origins from wild-mouse progenitors. The survey additionally identified frequent infection of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) with genetically divergent variants of MNV. These viruses are distinct from previously described MNV variants, differing by 22-23 % over the complete genome sequence compared with a maximum of 13 % between M. musculus-derived strains. Comparison with other noroviruses reveals that the Apodemus MNV groups with MNV in genogroup V and shares the same overall genome organization, predicted lengths of proteins encoded by ORFs 1-3 and the existence of a conserved alternative reading frame in VP1 encoding a homologue of the MNV ORF4. Different Apodemus MNV isolates were as variable as MNV isolates and showed evidence for inter-isolate recombination. Our observation of species-specific associations of MNV variants in wild populations suggests that murine noroviruses have an ancient origin, a feature that they may share with other norovirus genogroups.

      Swine and free-living nonporcine species from 20 Iowa swine farms were surveyed for antibodies against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The microtitration serum neutralization test was used, and antibody titers >/= 1:8 were considered positive. The overall prevalence in 267 sows in various groups was 37.8% (range 20-86%). The prevalence in sows maintained in total confinement was significantly lower than in sows not maintained in total confinement (p = 0.01). Prevalence in sows was not associated with other herd characteristics or with abundance estimates of rats and/or mice.Free-living animals tested included 74 domestic cats (Felis domestica), 203 house mice (Mus musculus), 15 mice of the genus Peromyscus, nine Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), 34 opossums (Didelphis virginiana), 14 raccoons (Procyon lotor), and seven striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Of these, the only seropositive animals were two domestic cats.The results of this study failed to implicate the free-living species surveyed as important reservoirs of EMCV for swine, and suggested that swine themselves and/or some species not included in this survey are the main reservoir of EMCV for swine in Iowa.

      Some rotaviruses from calves, piglets, and lambs were detected by electron microscopic examination of faeces but not by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which relies on detection of group antigen. On further examination by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, these viruses had 11 segments of dsRNA, as had typical rotaviruses, but arranged in atypical patterns. From humans, three rotaviruses with atypical electrophoretypes were also detected. Gnotobiotic animals were infected with atypical calf, piglet and lamb rotaviruses, and used to provide antigen and antiserum for an immunofluorescent comparison of these rotaviruses with conventional rotaviruses and other previously described atypical rotaviruses from piglets and chickens. Two atypical rotaviruses from humans failed to infect gnotobiotic piglets. The atypical rotaviruses could be tentatively categorized into two groups serologically distinct from each other and from conventional rotaviruses, and these distinctions were consistent with electrophoretypes . The atypical chicken rotavirus may form a fourth distinct group. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that rotaviruses belong to at least four separate groups definable by serology and electrophoretype .

      This paper presents an updated list of bat species positive for rabies in Brazil. It was developed based on database research via the internet, of international and national literature and annals of the most important technical and scientific meetings related to rabies and chiroptera in Brazil from 1996 to 2009. The new list of rabies positive bats consists of 41 species, belonging to 25 genera and three families: Phyllostomidae 43.9%, Vespertilionidae 29.3% and Molossidae 26.8%. In addition, questions were raised regarding the lack of data, including sex, age, circumstances and location of bat capture and incomplete and outdated species identification. Results of genetic and antigenic studies performed on Brazilian rabies positive bats were shown.

      Four Corners (FC) or Sin Nombre virus, a hantavirus harbored by the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), is the principal etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Recently, a hantavirus, designated New York (NY) virus, isolated from a white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) captured on Shelter Island, New York, was molecularly linked to a fatal case of HPS occurring in the northeastern United States. To clarify the genetic and phylogenetic relationship between NY and FC viruses and other sigmodontine rodent-borne hantaviruses, we amplified and sequenced the entire S genomic segment of NY virus. The S segment of NY virus was 2078 nucleotides long, with an open reading frame of 1284 nucleotides in the virus complementary strand, capable of encoding a protein of 428 amino acids, and with a 752-nucleotide long 3'-noncoding region, comprised of numerous imperfect repeats. Pairwise analysis indicated that NY virus was more similar to FC virus than to other sigmodontine rodent-borne hantaviruses, differing from strains of FC virus by 16.6-17.8% and 7.0-8.2% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. As determined by the maximum parsimony and neighbor-joining methods, NY virus formed a separate lineage from FC virus and was phylogenetically distinct from hantaviruses harbored by other sigmodontine rodents. Whether or not NY and FC viruses represent distinct viral species is unclear. Further analyses of hantaviruses harbored by white-footed mice are needed to clarify the genetic diversity and evolution of Peromyscus-borne hantaviruses.

      Prospect Hill virus (PH) was isolated from a meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) in 1982, and much of its genome has been sequenced. Hantaviruses of other New World microtine rodents have not been genetically characterized. We show that another Microtus species (the California vole M. californicus) from the United States is host to a genetically distinct PH-like hantavirus, Isla Vista virus (ILV). The nucleocapsid protein of ILV differs from that of PH by 11.1% and a portion of the G2 glycoprotein differs from that of PH by 19.6%. ILV antibodies were identified in five of 33 specimens of M. californicus collected in 1975 and 1994-1995. Enzymatic amplification studies showed that 1975 and 1994-1995 ILV genomes were highly similar. Secondary infection of Peromyscus californicus was identified in Santa Barbara County, California. A long-standing enzootic of a genetically distinct hantavirus lineage is present in California voles.

      It is well known that Norovirus (NoV) and Sapovirus (SaV) identified in humans and pigs have heterogeneous genome sequences. In this study, a total of three strains of NoV and 37 strains of SaV were detected in 567 porcine fecal samples by RT-PCR, corresponding detection rates of 0.5 and 6.5%, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using amino acid sequences of the partial RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and complete capsid proteins of both viruses to determine their genogroups. Analysis with the RdRp sequences indicated that all three NoV strains HW41, DG32, and DO35 detected in this study were classified into genogroup II (GII). A further analysis with the complete capsid sequence demonstrated that the DO35 strain belonged to subgenotype b in GII-21 (GII-21b) along with the SW918 strain. A total of 26 strains out of 27 strains that were selected from the 37 porcine SaVs were classified into genogroup III when they were analyzed with the RdRp sequences. The remaining strain (DO19) was not clustered with any of the previously classified SaV strains, thereby suggesting the advent of a new genogroup virus. Additional analyses with the amino acid sequence of the capsid and the nucleotide sequence of the RdRp and capsid junction region supported the notion that the DO19 strain belonged to a novel genogroup of SaV. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to describe a novel porcine SaV belonging to an unknown genogroup in Korea.

      Sporadic sudden deaths in adult white-tailed deer occurred from November 1997 through August 1998 on an Iowa game farm. Three of the 4 deer necropsied had severe pulmonary edema, widespread mild lymphocytic vasculitis, and amphophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies in scattered endothelial cells in blood vessels in the lung and abdominal viscera. Immunohistochemistry with bovine adenovirus 5 antisera and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated adenoviral antigen and nucleocapsids, respectively, within endothelial cells. Adenovirus was isolated in cell culture from 1 of the affected deer. The isolate was neutralized by California black-tailed deer adenovirus antiserum. These findings indicate that adenovirus should be considered in the differential diagnosis of both black-tailed and white-tailed deer with pulmonary edema and/or hemorrhagic enteropathy.

      We report the case findings of Australian bat lyssavirus infection in two black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) and one little red flying fox (Pteropus scapulatus) from north Queensland between January 1995 and August 1996. Although the P. alecto case in January 1995 is the first recognised case of Australian bat lyssavirus infection in Australia, this was a retrospective diagnosis made after identification of the index case at Ballina in May 1996. Eight persons had exposure to the three bats. Serum antibodies to classical rabies virus were measured in six of these persons; the only one seropositive was a veterinarian who had previously been vaccinated against rabies. Six persons received rabies vaccine following exposure. None of the in-contact humans developed signs of lyssavirus infection. For people exposed to Australian bat lyssavirus-positive bats who have not been scratched or bitten or had mucosal contamination by these bats, we suggest a post-exposure regime of five inoculations of the human diploid cell inactivated rabies vaccine.

      In the Kyasanur Forest disease area two species of wild monkeys, Presbytis entellus and Macaca radiata, succumb to the natural infection with Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) virus (family Flaviviridae). Between October 1964 and September 1973, 1046 monkeys (860 P. entellus and 186 M. radiata) died. Of these, KFD virus was isolated from 118 P. entellus and 13 M. radiata. Maximum mortality of monkeys was reported during December through May coinciding with the season of activity of immature stages of Haemaphysalis ticks, incriminated vectors of KFD. The epizootic showed an initial spread of the disease to the areas contiguous with the original focus of infection. This was followed by the recognition of epizootics and epidemics in three new foci, removed from the original focus, by the end of 1973. It was also observed that, in certain localities in the original focus, KFD virus activity persisted over several years.

      A juvenile offshore bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) was found stranded with neurological signs and unable to swim or float unassisted. It subsequently died, succumbing to a combination of severe pneumonia and encephalitis. Morbillivirus serum neutralisation test serology was positive (titre 1:16) for cetacean morbillivirus and negative for both phocine distemper virus and canine distemper virus. There was concurrent thymic and lymph node lymphoid depletion and necrosis, together with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic acidophilic viral inclusion bodies and multinucleate syncytia within multiple organs. Paramyxovirus capsids were identified in lung sections via electron microscopy and morbillivirus antigen was demonstrated within sections of lung, thymus and brain by immunohistochemistry. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for morbillivirus nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) genes were positive and phylogenetic gene product sequence analysis revealed 98% and 94% sequence identity to dolphin morbillivirus, respectively. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a cetacean mortality due to morbillivirus infection occurring in the southern hemisphere. Morbillivirus infection should be included in the differential diagnosis of stranded live or dead cetaceans in Australian waters, particularly if animals display neurological signs.

      A quantitative reverse-transcriptase real-time PCR assay, using TaqMan chemistry, for detecting bovine ephemeral virus (BEFV) is described. Available G gene sequences of viral RNA were aligned, and primers and probes were designed to recognize the virus. To quantitate the viruses, cDNA containing the real-time amplicon was prepared with a forward primer carrying the T7 promoter sequences. Run-off transcription from the T7 promoter amplicon template was used to prepare cRNA. Ten-fold dilutions of the run-off viral transcript were used as templates for the reaction in which they served as standards to quantitate unknown viral samples. By using this system it was shown that as few as 10-100 copies of a viral genome could be detected.

      For RNA viruses, rapid viral evolution and the biological similarity of closely related host species have been proposed as key determinants of the occurrence and long-term outcome of cross-species transmission. Using a data set of hundreds of rabies viruses sampled from 23 North American bat species, we present a general framework to quantify per capita rates of cross-species transmission and reconstruct historical patterns of viral establishment in new host species using molecular sequence data. These estimates demonstrate diminishing frequencies of both cross-species transmission and host shifts with increasing phylogenetic distance between bat species. Evolutionary constraints on viral host range indicate that host species barriers may trump the intrinsic mutability of RNA viruses in determining the fate of emerging host-virus interactions.

      To clarify the pathogenic relationships between human papillomavirus (HPV) and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN), we examined 71 vaginal biopsy specimens by histopathology and immunohistochemistry and analyzed the presence of HPV DNA by blot hybridization at Tm - 40 degrees C using an HPV 58 probe (PBM-58 method). We found 27 cases of VAIN in patients with previous hysterectomy or antecedent or concomitant cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 44 cases of VAIN in patients without any abnormal findings on the cervix and the vulva. Histopathologically, 53 of 71 cases were graded as VAIN I and 15 and 3 cases were VAIN II and III, respectively, while 59 cases showed positivity for HPV capsid antigen by immunohistochemistry. Using the PBM-58 method, all 71 VAIN cases harbored a single HPV type at more than 1,000 viral copies per cell. We identified 15 different types (HPV 16, 18, 30, 31, 35, 40, 42, 43, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 58 and 66). Furthermore, we molecularly cloned 7 novel prototypes (HPV 59, 61, 62, 64, 67, 69 and 71) from VAIN I. Our results are strongly indicative that HPVs are etiologic agents of VAIN, like in the case of CIN. The distinct manifestations of HPV infection in the vagina are discussed in comparison with those in the cervix.

      Understanding the vector and nonhuman vertebrate species contributing to Zika virus (ZIKAV) transmission is critical to understanding the ecology of this emerging arbovirus and its potential to establish in new geographic areas. This minireview summarizes what is known regarding the association of bats with flaviviruses (Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) with a particular emphasis on the potential role of bats in the sylvatic transmission of ZIKAV. Key research directions that remain to be addressed are also discussed.

      Particles with properties similar to those associated with human hepatitis B were found in serum from woodchucks with chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is suggested that woodchuck hepatitis virus is a second member of a novel class of viruses represented by the human hepatitis B virus.

      Wild and feral medium-sized mammals were live trapped at two natural protected areas within the Mexico City limits to determine antibody prevalence for the most common infectious diseases (rabies, toxoplasmosis, and canine parvovirus) in dogs and cats. Mammals were trapped during the dry (March-April) and rainy seasons (July-August) of 1996 and 1997. A total of 68 individuals were captured, representing 8 species: opossums (Didelphis virginiana), ringtails (Bassariscus astutus), spotted skunks (Spilogale gracilis), weasels (Mustela frenata), rock squirrels (Spermophilus variegatus), Mexican gray squirrels (Sciurus aureogaster), feral cats (Felis catus), and feral dogs (Canis familiaris). There was marked seroprevalence for parvovirus (86.6%) and lower seroprevalences for both toxoplasma (23.9%) and rabies (17.9%). There were no significant prevalence differences among mammals in both protected areas, which were of contrasting size and isolation (i.e., small and isolated versus large and nonisolated). We suggest that high seroprevalence of these three infectious agents in wild mammals is a result of the high densities of feral dogs and cats in the two areas sampled. Feral dogs are able to maintain the infectious agents in these localities regardless of the protected area size and isolation. However, the native mammals of the small and isolated reserve are more vulnerable to infectious diseases because of small population size and genetic bottlenecks. Our results indicate that natural areas in and around Mexico City are a refugium for latent infectious agents, several of which are zoonotic. These findings suggest that conservation measures, such as eradication of feral mammals and vaccination programs, in the protected areas and surrounding areas could be beneficial.

      We describe the genetic analysis of samples from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) patients from southern and southeastern states of Brazil and rodents captured at the presumed site of infection of these patients. A total of 65 samples that were antibody-positive for Sin Nombre or Laguna Negra virus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were processed by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by using several primer combinations in the M and S genome segments. PCR products were amplified and sequenced from samples from 11 HPS patient and 7 rodent samples. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequence differences showed the cocirculation of Araraquara and Juquitiba-like viruses, previously characterized from humans. Our genetic data indicate that Araraquara virus is associated with Bolomys lasiurus (hairy-tailed Bolo mouse) and the Juquitiba-like virus is associated with Oligoryzomys nigripes (black-footed pigmy rice rat).

      Twenty three strains of simian viruses isolated from nasopharyngeal swabs and respiratory tissues of cynomolgus monkeys showing mild symptoms of respiratory disorders were classified into three groups by their biological, serological and morphological characteristics. Thirteen strains classified as group 1 were judged to be enteroviruses. Four strains of group 2 and six strains of group 3 were identified as simian adenoviruses. Yields of the ten simian adenoviruses of groups 2 and 3 were compared in three continuous cell lines after several serial passages.

      To determine reservoir hosts for Marburg virus (MARV), we examined the fauna of a mine in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The mine was associated with a protracted outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever during 1998-2000. We found MARV nucleic acid in 12 bats, comprising 3.0%-3.6% of 2 species of insectivorous bat and 1 species of fruit bat. We found antibody to the virus in the serum of 9.7% of 1 of the insectivorous species and in 20.5% of the fruit bat species, but attempts to isolate virus were unsuccessful.

      We investigated the epidemiology of the European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in Finland among free-living mountain hares (Lepus timidus) and European brown hares (Lepus europaeus). Carcasses of 297 European brown hares and 843 mountain hares submitted for postmortem examination were analyzed between 1990 and 2002. One hundred thirty-six cases of EBHS were detected during the examination, 20 cases in European brown hares and 116 in mountain hares. Liver samples from 56 histopathologically positive and 135 negative cases were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results of RT-PCR correlated well with histopathology. Cases of EBHS appeared only sporadically in a restricted area in eastern Finland during 1990-97. In 1998, the number of cases increased, and the disease spread to the north. In 1998-99, EBHS was the most common disease of mountain hares in necropsy material from northern and eastern Finland. Special features were the occurrence of the disease in areas in which European brown hares are rare and the seasonal distribution of cases, most of which appeared in spring or summer. This is the first report of an outbreak of EBHS occurring mainly among free-living mountain hares from Finland.

      Consensus primer mediated PCR protocols have the potential to amplify previously uncharacterized human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes. In a study on 500 cervicovaginal samples, we amplified four sequences (L1AE 1 to L1AE 4) that failed to hybridize to any of the available HPV type-specific oligonucleotide probes. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the sequences were derived from the L1 region of hitherto unsequenced genotypes. Comparison of phylogenetic trees based on the amplified L1 sequences with E6-derived phylogenetic trees resulted in the identification of L1AE 1 and L1AE 2 as putative novel HPV PCR genotypes. L1AE 1 was related to HPV 39, whereas L1AE 2 was related to HPV 51. The L1AE 3 and L1AE 4 sequences occupied L1-phylogenetic branches equivalent to the positions of HPV 66 and HPV 61, respectively, in an E6-phylogenetic tree.

      We determined the prevalence of infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) among small mammals in northern Italy and analyzed long-term dynamics of LCMV in a rodent population in the province of Trento. LCMV is circulating among the most widespread and common wild rodent species in this area (Apodemus flavicollis, Myodes glareolus, and Microtus arvalis); overall prevalence is 6.8%. During 2000-2006, intensive monitoring of LCMV in a population of yellow-necked mice (A. flavicollis) showed a positive correlation between prevalence of infection and rodent density. At the individual level, weight and sex appeared to correlate with antibody prevalence, which suggests that horizontal transmission of LCMV occurs principally among heavier, older males and occurs during fighting. Isolation and genetic characterization of this virus will be the crucial next steps for a better understanding of its ecology.

      Yokose virus (strain Oita-36) was isolated from the bat in Japan in 1971. In the present study, we determined complete nucleotide sequences of Yokose virus using RT-PCR and RACE techniques. Yokose virus genome consists of 10,857 nucleotides in length (accession no. AB114858), containing a single open reading frame (3425 amino acids) encoding 11 viral proteins. We deduced the boundaries of each protein in the polyprotein sequence according to the protein cleavage sites of other flaviviruses. The nucleotide sequences of the 5' and 3' nontranslated region (NTR) and amino acid sequences of individual proteins of the virus were compared with those of six other flaviviruses including Japanese encephalitis virus, dengue-2 virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Rio Bravo virus or Modoc virus. Yokose virus demonstrated the highest similarity to yellow fever virus. Yokose virus also has CS1 motif, which are well-conserved specifically in mosquito-born flaviviruses, in its 3' NTR. When a part of the NS5 amino acid sequence (345 amino acids) was compared with those of other four flaviviruses, Entebbe bat virus, Sokuluk virus, Sepik virus, and yellow fever virus, the three former viruses are more closely related to Yokose virus than yellow fever virus. Human sera from dengue-virus-infected case and yellow fever vaccine reacted with the viral proteins. Moreover, human serum from a yellow fever vaccine weakly neutralized Yokose virus. Our results suggest that there are cross-reactive antigenicities among Yokose virus and other flaviviruses.

      The biological properties of a new lymphotropic papovavirus have been described. The virus replicates only in certain human and monkey B lymphoblastoid cell lines and appears to have a strict requirement for dividing cells in order to grow. Human T or null cells do not support its growth. Serologic evidence has been presented to show that virtually all primates, including man, are infected with viruses similar or identical to the African green monkey lymphotropic papovavirus. Approximately 30% of normal adults have antibody to LPV. This antibody has been shown to be specific since it neutralizes LPV and immuno-precipitates the major viral capsid protein. Preliminary seroepidemiologic studies have not revealed any association of LPV to human disease, but further, more detailed investigations are necessary to assess its importance in humans.

      Infection by Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) species (Family Bunyaviridae, Genus Orthobunyavirus) has been detected in ewes, goats, cows, horses and humans all the way through America. However, there are no evidences of such infection in birds. To detect BUNV (CbaAr-426) infection in free ranging birds, a serological survey was carried out in Córdoba city between 2004 and 2005. Birds of 13 families presented neutralizing antibodies against BUNV (CbaAr-426), showing an increase in the seroprevalence from 6.6% to 13.8% between 2004 and 2005, respectively. Seroconversion for BUNV (CbaAr-426) was detected in Rufus hornero (Furnarius rufus) in January-February of 2005. This is the first evidence of natural infection by BUNV (CbaAr-426) in free ranging birds. The seroconversion level demonstrated active circulation of BUNV (CbaAr 426) in Córdoba city.

      Elevated exposure levels to non-human primates (NHP) and NHP bushmeat represent major risk factors for zoonotic disease transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Demography can affect personal nutritional behavior, and thus rates of contact to NHP bushmeat. Here, we analyzed demographic and NHP contact data from 504 participants of differing demographic backgrounds living in proximity to the Taï National Park in Western Côte d'Ivoire (CI) to identify factors impacting the risk of NHP exposure. Overall, participants' contact rates to NHP were high, and increased along a gradient of bushmeat processing (e.g., 7.7% hunted, but 61.9% consumed monkeys). Contact to monkeys was significantly more frequent than to chimpanzees, most likely a reflection of meat availability and hunting effort. 17.2% of participants reported previous interaction with NHP pets. Generalized linear mixed model analysis revealed significant effects of sex, country of birth or ethnicity on rates of NHP bushmeat contact, with male participants from CI being at particular risk of exposure to NHP. The presence of zoonotic pathogens in humans and NHP in Taï further highlights the risk for zoonotic disease emergence in this region. Our results are relevant for formulating prevention strategies to reduce zoonotic pathogen burden in tropical Africa.

      A 24-year-old man from rural Mississippi had a case of California encephalitis (CE) that evolved as a subacute encephalomyelitis. The incidence of CE in adults is low, especially in the southeastern United States, and to our knowledge the clinical profile of symptomatic disease in adults has not been established. The characteristics of CE and St Louis encephalitis, the usual cause of arboviral illness affecting adults in the Southeast, differ.

      From November 1991 through March 1992, we evaluated 101 free-ranging American bison (Bison bison) from Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming (USA) for exposure to infectious organisms that commonly infect cattle. No titers were detected for bluetongue virus, bovine leukemia virus, or Campylobacter fetus in these 101 bison. Detectable antibodies occurred against Anaplasma marginale (eight of 76, 11%), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (31 of 101, 31%), bovine viral diarrhea (31 of 101, 31%), bovine herpesvirus 1 (29 of 76, 38%), Leptospira interrogans icterohaemorrhagiae (four of 101, 4%), L interrogans hardjo (seven of 101, 7%), L interrogans autumnalis (one of 101, 1%), L interrogans bratislava (seven of 101, 7%), L interrogans australis (one of 101, 1%), and parainfluenza 3 virus (27 of 75, 36%). The low antibody titers and the lack of gross lesions are evidence that while previous exposure to infectious organisms may have occurred, none appeared to have active infections.

      Laboratory diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is generally performed by virus isolation in cell culture and immunofluorescent assays. Reverse transcriptase PCR is now recognized as a sensitive and specific alternative for detection of respiratory RNA viruses. A rapid real-time multiplex PCR assay was developed for the detection of influenza A and influenza B viruses, human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), PIV2, PIV3, and PIV4 in a two-tube multiplex reaction which used molecular beacons to discriminate the pathogens. A total of 358 respiratory samples taken over a 1-year period were analyzed by the multiplex assay. The incidence of respiratory viruses detected in these samples was 67 of 358 (19%) and 87 of 358 (24%) by culture and real-time PCR, respectively. Culture detected 3 influenza A virus, 2 influenza B virus, 57 RSV, 2 PIV1, and 2 PIV3 infections. All of these culture-positive samples and an additional 5 influenza A virus, 6 RSV, 2 PIV1, 1 PIV2, 1 PIV3, and 3 PIV4 infections were detected by the multiplex real-time PCR. The application of real-time PCR to clinical samples increases the sensitivity for respiratory viral diagnosis. In addition, results can be obtained within 6 h, which increases clinical relevance. Therefore, use of this real-time PCR assay would improve patient management and infection control.

      We have characterized the complete genome (8300 bp) of an isolate of Felis domesticus papillomavirus (FdPV) from a domestic cat with cutaneous papillomatosis. A BLAST homology search using the nucleotide sequence of the L1 open reading frame demonstrated that the FdPV genome was most closely related to canine oral papillomavirus (COPV). A 384 bp non-coding region (NCR) was found between the end of L1 and the beginning of E6, and a 1.3 kbp NCR was located between the end of E2 and the beginning of L2. Phylogenetic analysis placed FdPV in the E3 clade with COPV. Both viruses contain the atypical second NCR, which has no homology with sequences in existing databases.

      Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are distributed worldwide and are involved mainly in the pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections. The development and optimization of three quantitative reverse transcription real time polymerase chain reactions (RT Real Time Qt-PCRs) and an indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) for the detection and quantitation of HPIV-1, -2 and -3 in clinical samples are described. Efficiency, sensitivity, specificity, inter- and intra-assay variability and turnaround time of the two methods were compared. These assays have been validated on 131 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Based on the results obtained, the molecular methods represent a valid and rapid tool for clinical management and should be included in diagnostic panels aimed to evaluate suspected respiratory tract infections.

      Five isolations of the Alagoas serotype of vesicular stomatitis virus (Rhabdoviridae: Vesiculovirus) were made from naturally infected phlebotomine sand flies (Lutzomyia spp.) collected in Colombia. These are the first isolations of Alagoas virus from an arthropod. Replication of the virus occurred in laboratory-reared sand flies (Lutzomyia longipalpis) after inoculation. Bite and transovarial transmission of the virus was also demonstrated in experimentally infected sand flies. Alagoas virus neutralizing antibodies were found in sera of humans and animals living near the insect collection site; antibody rates among human residents of two nearby towns were 63% and 83%, respectively. Results of comparative serologic studies demonstrated that Alagoas virus is closely related antigenically to Indiana, Cocal, and Maraba viruses and that these four agents form a complex within the vesicular stomatitis virus serogroup. The antigenic similarity among these four viruses makes their differentiation difficult; it also raises doubts about the accuracy of current laboratory methods used for identifying isolates in this serogroup. A discussion follows on the significance of human antibodies to these agents and on the role of sand flies in their ecology.

      We present evidence for a novel member of the hepadnavirus family that is endemic in wild arctic ground squirrels (Spermophylus parryi kennicotti) in Alaska. This virus, designated arctic squirrel hepatitis virus (ASHV), was initially detected in the livers of animals bearing large hepatic nodules by nucleic acid hybridization with hepadnavirus probes and in plasma by cross-reactivity with antibodies to hepadnavirus surface and core antigens. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 3,302-bp-long ASHV genome was determined and compared with those of ground squirrel hepatitis virus (GSHV) and woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV); all sequences were organized into four open reading frames, designated pre-C/C, pre-S/S, pol, and X. Despite roughly equivalent variability among the three rodent hepadnaviruses (around 16% base and 19% amino acid exchanges), ASHV appeared to be more closely related to GSHV than to WHV in phylogenetic analysis. Accordingly, preliminary studies of the pathology of ASHV infection suggested that ASHV may be a less efficient oncogenic agent than WHV. About one-third of aged animals maintained in captivity, including virus-infected as well as uninfected squirrels, developed large liver nodules, consisting of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas or nonmalignant lesions characterized by drastic microvesicular steatosis. ASHV-infected arctic ground squirrels may serve as a new model with which to analyze the contribution of hepadnavirus- and host-specific determinants to liver pathology and tumorigenesis.

      Cheetah populations are diminishing rapidly in their natural habitat. One reason for their decline is thought to be a high susceptibility to (infectious) diseases because cheetahs in zoos suffer from high disease-induced mortality. Data on the health status of free-ranging cheetahs are scarce, and little is known about their exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. We determined seroprevalences to nine key viruses (feline herpesvirus 1, feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], puma lentivirus, feline leukemia virus, and rabies virus) in 68 free-ranging cheetahs on east-central Namibian farmland, 24 nonvaccinated Namibian captive cheetahs, and several other wild carnivore species and conducted necropsies of cheetahs and other wild carnivores. Eight of 11 other wild carnivores were seropositive for at least one of the viruses, including the first record of an FIV-like infection in a wild felid west of the Kalahari, the caracal (Felis caracal). Seroprevalences of the free-ranging cheetahs were below 5% for all nine viruses, which is significantly lower than seroprevalences in nonvaccinated captive cheetahs and those for five of seven viruses in previously studied free-ranging cheetahs from north-central Namibia (L. Munson, L. Marker, E. Dubovi, J. A. Spencer, J. F. Evermann, and S. J. O'Brien, J. Wildl. Dis. 40:23-31, 2004). There was no clinical or pathological evidence of infectious diseases in living or dead cheetahs. The results suggest that while free-ranging wild carnivores may be a source of pathogens, the distribution of seroprevalences across studies mirrored local human population density and factors associated with human habitation, probably reflecting contact opportunities with (nonvaccinated) domestic and feral cats and dogs. They also suggest that Namibian cheetahs respond effectively to viral challenges, encouraging consistent and sustainable conservation efforts.

      Fresh and formalin-fixed tissues and blood samples in ethylenediaminetetraacetate were collected from cattle, deer and buffalo with clinical signs suggestive of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF). In addition, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks collected from these animals and retrospectively from field cases of MCF were examined. DNA samples extracted from these samples were analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers specific for the sheep-associated (SA)- and wildebeest-associated (WA)-MCF viruses. Both the SA-MCF virus and WA-MCF virus PCR yielded positive results which were in nearly complete agreement with the histopathological diagnoses of MCF in fresh and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 29 cattle, 24 deer and three buffaloes. Some blood samples tested by the two assays indicated that some of the infected cattle were possible carriers.

      1. The characteristics of a filterable virus obtained from mice found spontaneously paralyzed and showing lesions of encephalomyelitis are described. 2. The course of the disease in mice, following intracerebral inoculation, is briefly as follows: After an incubation period varying from 7 to over 30 days a flaccid paralysis of one of the limbs appears. This paralysis usually spreads rapidly until all four limbs are affected. Young mice are more susceptible than older ones, and very young mice, less than 4 weeks of age, usually die without showing signs of paralysis. 3. Adult mice often show no signs of infection after an intracerebral inoculation of virus. A number of these mice, although showing no signs of paralysis, nevertheless have become infected, a fact which is demonstrated by recovery of the virus from the mice as well as by histopathological studies. 4. Intranasal instillation of the virus is the only other method of producing the infection. This method, however, produces paralysis in only a small percentage of the mice. Following intranasal instillation of the virus, there often develops a slight immunity to a subsequent intracerebral injection of virus. 5. The paralysis in the surviving mice recedes gradually, but a permanent residual paralysis, usually of the hind legs, is almost invariable. Such mice, however, are virus carriers, as the virus can be recovered from the spinal cord for 1 year after infection. 6. Paralyzed mice are immune to a subsequent intracerebral injection of the virus. There is evidence that neutralizing substances are present in the immune mice. A considerable proportion of the mice which have remained well after an intracerebral injection of virus are immune to a second injection. 7. The virus resists the action of 50 per cent glycerine at from 2-4 degrees C. for at least 150 days. It passes all grades of Berkefeld filters with ease. By the use of graded collodion filters, the size of the virus particle has been determined to be probably about 13 to 19 mmicro. 8. The virus of mouse encephalomyelitis is not pathogenic for rhesus monkeys. No evidence of immunological relationship with the virus of human poliomyelitis has been obtained. 9. The anatomical basis of the paralysis is an acute necrosis of the ganglion cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Isolated ganglion cells of the cerebrum also undergo necrosis. Following the acute necrosis of the ganglion cells, there is a marked neuronophagia. A perivascular infiltration is observed in the brain and spinal cord.

      The presence of antibodies against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), bovid herpesvirus 6 (BHV-6), herpesvirus of Cervidae type 1 (HVC-1), reindeer herpesvirus, bovine herpesvirus 2 (BHV-2) and bovid herpesvirus 4 (BHV-4) was investigated in wild ruminants of France and Belgium between 1981 and 1986. There were no animals serologically positive for BHV-4. Antibodies against BHV-2 were demonstrated in roe deer (Cervus capreolus) (less than 1%) and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) (1%) in France. Animals seropositive to the four related viruses (BHV-1, BHV-6, HVC-1, reindeer herpesvirus) were detected in red deer (Cervus elaphus) in France and Belgium (1% and 11%, respectively), in roe deer (less than 1%) from France, in chamois (4%) in France and in ibex (Capra ibex) (4%) from France. The presence of antibodies against HVC-1, especially in red deer from Belgium, may suggest that wild ruminants in continental Europe are now infected with this virus, which previously has been isolated only in Scotland.

      A poxvirus isolated from the respiratory tract of raccoons in a forest and swamp area near Aberdeen, Maryland, was characterized by biological, serological, and biophysical methods. The virus was shown to be related to the vaccinia-variola subgroup by serological and biophysical methods, but measurably different from the other viruses of this group by biological methods. It causes flaccid paralysis in 1-day-old suckling mice and does not grow well on CAM after two or three passages.

      A parapoxvirus has been implicated in the decline of the red squirrel in the United Kingdom. Virus was isolated from an outbreak of lethal disease in red squirrels in the north-east of England. Experimental infection of captive-bred red squirrels confirmed that this virus was the cause of the severe skin lesions observed. Electron microscopic examination of the virus showed that it had a morphology typical of parapoxviruses whilst preliminary sequence data suggested a genomic G+C composition of approximately 66 %, again similar to that found in other parapoxviruses. However Southern hybridization analysis failed to detect three known parapoxvirus genes, two of which have been found so far only in the genus parapoxvirus. Comparative sequence analysis of two other genes, conserved across the eight recognized chordopoxvirus genera, suggests that the squirrel virus represents a previously unrecognized genus of the chordopoxvirus.

      The pathological findings are described in three cases of infectious canine hepatitis in free-ranging red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in England. The foxes died after short periods of clinical illness. Mild jaundice and hepatic congestion were evident grossly. On histopathological examination, intranuclear inclusion bodies were visible in hepatocytes, in association with hepatocyte dissociation and necrosis, as well as in renal glomeruli, renal tubular epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1) was isolated from all three foxes. In a serological study, antibodies to CAV-1 were detected in tissue fluid extracts taken from 11 of 58 (19 per cent) frozen red fox carcases from England and Scotland.

      Partial genome characterisation of a non-cultivable marsupial adenovirus is described. Adenovirus-like particles were found by electron microscopy (EM) in the intestinal contents of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in New Zealand. Using degenerate PCR primers complementary to the most conserved genome regions of adenoviruses, the complete nucleotide sequence of the penton base gene, and partial nucleotide sequences of the DNA polymerase, hexon, and pVII genes were obtained. Phylogenetic analysis of the penton base gene strongly suggested that the brushtail possum adenovirus (candidate PoAdV-1) belongs to the recently proposed genus Atadenovirus. Sequence analysis of the PCR products amplified from the intestinal contents of brushtail possums originating from different geographical regions of New Zealand identified a single genotype. This is the first report of molecular confirmation of an adenovirus in a marsupial.

      A cytopathic infectious agent was isolated from the kidneys of an apparently healthy tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) that had been captured in the area around Bangkok. The infectivity was propagated in Tupaia fibroblast and kidney cell cultures. Paramyxovirus-like pleomorphic enveloped particles and helical nucleocapsids were observed by electron microscopy and accordingly the infectious agent was termed Tupaia paramyxovirus (TPMV). However, no serological cross-reactions were detected between TPMV and known paramyxoviruses. For the molecular characterization of TPMV an experimental strategy that allows the random-primed synthesis of relatively large cDNA molecules from viral genomic RNA was applied. Nucleotide sequence analysis of a TPMV-specific cDNA fragment (1544 bp) revealed two nonoverlapping partial open reading frames corresponding to paramyxoviral N and P transcription units. Using modified rapid amplification of cDNA ends techniques, a substantial contiguous portion of the viral genome (4065 nt) was elucidated including the complete N and P/V/C genes. The coding strategy of TPMV as well as significant amino acid sequence homologies clearly indicates an evolutionary relationship between TPMV and members of the genus Morbillivirus. Highest homologies were detected between TPMV and Hendra virus (equine morbillivirus), which recently emerged in Australia, causing outbreaks of fatal respiratory and neurological disease in horses and humans.

      Simple retroviruses present a unique opportunity for examining the host-virus relationship. Following exogenous infection and integration into the germ line, copies of these viruses can become fixed within the genome. The resulting endogenous proviral ""fossils"" represent a record of past retroviral infections and forms. Previous work in our laboratory has been directed at dissecting the extensive nonecotropic murine leukemia virus content of the mouse genome. One such provirus, hortulanus endogenous murine leukemia virus (HEMV), found in a single copy in the genome of Mus spicilegus, was remarkable for characteristics that suggested that it was ancient and related to the hypothetical common ancestor of murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) and other gammaretroviral species. In the present study, we have analyzed its functional properties. Transfection of a molecular clone of the HEMV provirus into mouse-derived cell lines revealed that it is replication competent. Furthermore, host range and interference studies revealed a strictly ecotropic host range and the use of a receptor distinct from those used by other classical MLVs. The identity of nucleotide sequence of the long terminal repeats (LTRs) further suggested that HEMV is a relatively recent insertion into the M. spicilegus genome at the distal end of chromosome 7. Although unique to M. spicilegus, its presence in a homozygous state in three individuals obtained from different regions implies that it has been present long enough to become fixed in this species. Exhaustive phylogenetic analysis of all regions of the HEMV genome supported the previously assigned ancestral position of HEMV relative to other MLV-related viruses. Thus, HEMV is a relatively recent introduction into the Mus germ line but is representative of a relatively ancestral MLV group.

      Foamy viruses (FVs) are complex retroviruses which have been isolated from different animal species including nonhuman primates, cattle, and cats. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a new FV isolated from blood samples of horses. Similar to other FVs, the equine foamy virus (EFV) exhibits a highly characteristic ultrastructure and induces syncytium formation and subsequent cell lysis on a large number of cell lines. Molecular cloning of EFV reveals that the general organization is that of other known FVs, whereas sequence similarity with its bovine FV counterpart is only 40%. Interestingly, EFV buds exclusively from the plasma membrane and not from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as previously shown for other FVs. The absence of the ER retrieval dilysine motif in EFV Env is likely responsible for this unexpected sorting pathway.

      On the basis of clinical signs and histological findings eight 9-month-old male rusa deer (Cervus timorensis) were diagnosed with sheep associated-malignant catarrhal fever. Following a variable course involving rectal temperatures around 40.5 degrees C, depression, inappetence, diarrhoea, corneal opacity and hypopyon all animals died or were euthanased over a 5-week period. Severe multifocal vasculitis, mainly periglomerular and in the arcuate vessels were consistent histological findings which in the past have been adequate to confirm clinical diagnosis of sheep associated-malignant catarrhal fever. A nested polymerase chain reaction test has been used to detect a sheep associated-malignant catarrhal fever PRC product, 238 base-pairs in size, in DNA extracted from lymphocyte preparations. The result supported the diagnosis of sheep associated-malignant catarrhal fever in these deer.

      We report 2 cases of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infection in field workers, possibly contracted through rodent bites. Screening for antibodies to SNV in rodents trapped in 2 seasons showed that 9.77% were seropositive. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that 2 of 79 deer mice had detectable titers of SNV RNA.

      El Moro Canyon hantavirus (ELMC, previously known as HMV-1) is associated with the western harvest mouse Reithrodontomys megalotis. The interpretation that ELMC is a novel hantavirus was based upon comparisons of the nucleotide sequence of the S genomic segment with those of other hantaviruses. We now show that the ELMC M genome, like the S genome, is genetically similar to but distinct from that of Four Corners hantavirus (FC). The ELMC M genome is 3801 nt in length and encodes a glycoprotein precursor of 1139 amino acids. The G1 and G2 genes are 71 and 73.1% identical to those of FC and the corresponding glycoproteins are 73.5 and 82.3% identical. A portion of the G1 glycoprotein of ELMC that is homologous to an important linear epitope of FC differs from the FC epitope by 10 of 31 residues. That domain and flanking sequences were expressed in Escherichia coli. G1 antibodies from 3 of 19 FC-infected patients showed cross-reactivity with ELMC by Western blot assay. The portion of the ELMC G1 antigen recognized by those antibodies is the region of homology to the FC epitope. These data support our previous interpretation that ELMC is distinct from FC and other hantaviruses.

      Surveillance for mosquito-borne viruses was conducted in Barkedji area from 1990 to 1995, following an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus in southern Mauritania. Mosquitoes, sand flies, and midges were collected from human bait and trapped by solid-state U.S. Army battery-powered CDC miniature light traps baited with dry ice or animals (sheep or chickens) at four ponds. Overall, 237,091 male and female mosquitoes representing 52 species in eight genera, 214,967 Phlebotomine sand flies, and 2,527 Culicoides were collected, identified, and tested for arboviruses in 9,490 pools (7,050 pools of female and 331 of male mosquitoes, 2,059 pools of sand flies and 50 pools of Culicoides). Viruses isolated included one Alphavirus, Babanki (BBK); six Flaviviruses, Bagaza (BAG), Ar D 65239, Wesselsbron (WSL), West Nile (WN), Koutango (KOU), Saboya (SAB); two Bunyavirus, Bunyamwera (BUN) and Ngari (NRI); two Phleboviruses, Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Gabek Forest (GF); one Orbivirus, Ar D 66707 (Sanar); one Rhabdovirus, Chandipura (CHP); and one unclassified virus, Ar D 95537. Based on repeated isolations, high field infection rates and abundance, Culex appeared to be the vectors of BAG, BBK, Ar D 65239 (BAG-like), and WN viruses, Ae. vexans and Ae. ochraceus of RVF virus, Mansonia of WN and BAG viruses, Mimomyia of WN and BAG viruses, and Phlebotomine of SAB, CHP, Ar D 95537, and GF viruses. Our data indicate that RVF virus circulated repeatedly in the Barkedji area.

      Sixty-seven benign precancerous cutaneous lesions from the ears of 51 sheep were examined for papillomavirus DNA by hybridisation to radioactively labelled or biotinylated probes of bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV 1) DNA under varying conditions of stringency. An additional 16 precancerous lesions from other cutaneous sites on 15 sheep and 15 samples of lesion-free skin from nine sheep were similarly examined. Both total genomic and subgenomic probes were used. DNA from 10 aural lesions and one vulval lesion reacted with the probe in a manner indicative of the presence of episomal papillomavirus DNA. Papillomavirus DNA was detected at low stringency in eight of the 10 aural lesions and the vulval lesions, and at high stringency in two aural lesions. Three out of the 8 aural lesions that were positive at low stringency reacted when re-tested at high stringency. Hybridisation with one of the samples of lesion-free ovine skin produced occasional equivocal signals. One particular positive lesion, an ovine aural cutaneous horn, was studied in more detail. When treated with restriction endonucleases, its restriction enzyme pattern was the same as that for BPV 2 DNA with eight of twelve enzymes and the same as that for BPV 1 DNA with two of the twelve enzymes. It was concluded that this ovine papillomavirus was more closely related to BPV 2 than to BPV 1. The possibility that it could be a subtype of BPV 2 is discussed.

      The seroprevalence of canine parvovirus (CPV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus (CAV) and canine herpesvirus (CHV) infections in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) was determined in fox sera collected between 1991 and 1995. A total of 500 sera were selected and the seroprevalences were estimated to be 13% (65 of 500 sera) for CPV, 4.4% (17 of 383 sera) for CDV, 35% (17 of 485 sera) for CAV, and 0.4% (2 of 485 sera) for CHV, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two (rural and suburban) areas under study. Parvovirus DNA sequences were amplified from tissues of free-ranging foxes and compared to those of prototype viruses from dogs and cats. We report here a parvovirus sequence indicative of a true intermediate between the feline panleukopenia virus-like viruses and the canine parvovirus-like viruses. The red fox parvoviral sequence, therefore, appears to represent a link between those viral groups. The DNA sequence together with a significant seroprevalence of parvovirus infections in foxes supports the hypothesis that the sudden emergence of canine parvovirus in the domestic dog population may have involved the interspecies transmission between wild and domestic carnivores.

      Two hundred and three sera obtained in 1993-96 from red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), lynx (Lynx lynx), brown bears (Ursus arctos) and wolverines (Gulo gulo) in Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland) were examined for the presence of anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies by a competition enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). High prevalences were found for the red foxes in Norway (7/62, 11%) and Finland (7/14, 50%). While only one of 73 (1%) lynx from Finland had anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies, a high prevalence was found in sera from the Sarek National Park in Sweden (5/17, 29%). In addition, anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies were found in one brown bear from the same area (1/45, 2%), whereas none of the 14 wolverines were seropositive. This is the first report of anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies in the brown bear and the lynx, and the first screening for such antibodies in Sweden and Finland. These results indicate that orthopoxviruses are distributed in Sweden and Finland as well as in Norway, and that the red fox and the European lynx may serve as indicator species for the presence of orthopoxviruses in the local populations of small mammals.

      Two hundred and twenty one blood samples representing eight different rodent species and the common shrew (Sorex araneus), collected in Norway between 1993 and 1995, were examined for anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies by a competition enzyme linked imunnosorbent assay (ELISA) and, when possible, an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The serological results indicated that the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and Norway lemming (Lemmus lemmus) may be reservoir species for orthopoxviruses in Norway, with antibody prevalences of 17 (12/69), 30 (24/81) and 56% (19/34), respectively. Orthopoxvirus infection in lemmings has not been reported previously. On some other small rodent species such as field voles (Microtus agrestis), common rats (Rattus norvegicus), and common shrews, seropositive individuals were detected. However, the total number of tested animals was low, and the role of these species in the epidemiology of orthopoxvirus infections remains unclear. Attempts to isolate orthopoxviruses from these small mammals failed, although orthopoxvirus specific DNA sequences were detected previously in the same animals by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The serological results were compared with and discussed in the context of the occurrence of orthopoxvirus-specific DNA sequences, and it is concluded that orthopoxviruses are widely distributed among wildlife in Norway.

      A virus (designated the Shintoku strain) which was morphologically indistinguishable from group A rotaviruses was detected in the feces of adult cows with diarrhea in Japan. The virus contained 11 segments of double-stranded RNA and had an electrophoretic migration pattern in polyacrylamide gels similar to that of other group C rotaviruses (4-3-2-2). Feces containing the bovine virus reacted with antiserum to porcine group C rotavirus (Cowden strain) but not group A or B rotaviruses in immunoelectron microscopy. The virus was adapted to serial propagation in roller tube cultures of a rhesus monkey kidney cell line (MA104) by using high concentrations of trypsin. Evidence for viral replication in MA104 cell cultures was demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy and indirect immunofluorescence by using antiserum to porcine group C rotavirus and by electrophoretic analysis of extracted viral double-stranded RNA. A significant antibody response against the isolate was detected in convalescent-phase sera of cows which excreted the virus: no increased antibody response to bovine group A rotavirus was observed. To our knowledge, this is the first isolation of a group C rotavirus from cattle.

      The HNF61 and HNF70 isolates of porcine adenovirus type 5 (PAV-5) were cultivated in PK-15 cells, and viral DNA was extracted from the infected cells by a modified Hirt procedure. The DNAs were digested by each of 9 restriction endonucleases, and fragments representing the entire genomes were cloned. Based on the sizes of the restriction enzyme fragments, the genome of each isolate was estimated to be 33.2 kb. Physical maps for the 9 restriction endonucleases were constructed. The physical maps of the two isolates were identical for 5 of the restriction endonucleases, but 4 enzymes revealed differences in restriction sites occurring mainly between map units 78 and 83, which may include the E3 region of the genome. There were no similarities between the physical maps of PAV-5 and those described for the other 4 serotypes of PAV.

      Sheeppox virus (SPPV) and goatpox virus (GTPV), members of the Capripoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae, are etiologic agents of important diseases of sheep and goats in northern and central Africa, southwest and central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Here we report the genomic sequence and comparative analysis of five SPPV and GTPV isolates, including three pathogenic field isolates and two attenuated vaccine viruses. SPPV and GTPV genomes are approximately 150 kbp and are strikingly similar to each other, exhibiting 96% nucleotide identity over their entire length. Wild-type genomes share at least 147 putative genes, including conserved poxvirus replicative and structural genes and genes likely involved in virulence and host range. SPPV and GTPV genomes are very similar to that of lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), sharing 97% nucleotide identity. All SPPV and GTPV genes are present in LSDV. Notably in both SPPV and GTPV genomes, nine LSDV genes with likely virulence and host range functions are disrupted, including a gene unique to LSDV (LSDV132) and genes similar to those coding for interleukin-1 receptor, myxoma virus M003.2 and M004.1 genes (two copies each), and vaccinia virus F11L, N2L, and K7L genes. The absence of these genes in SPPV and GTPV suggests a significant role for them in the bovine host range. SPPV and GTPV genomes contain specific nucleotide differences, suggesting they are phylogenetically distinct. Relatively few genomic changes in SPPV and GTPV vaccine viruses account for viral attenuation, because they contain 71 and 7 genomic changes compared to their respective field strains. Notable genetic changes include mutation or disruption of genes with predicted functions involving virulence and host range, including two ankyrin repeat proteins in SPPV and three kelch-like proteins in GTPV. These comparative genomic data indicate the close genetic relationship among capripoxviruses, and they suggest that SPPV and GTPV are distinct and likely derived from an LSDV-like ancestor.

      Hendra virus (HeV) was first isolated in 1994, from a disease outbreak involving at least 21 horses and two humans in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, Australia. The affected horses and humans all developed a severe but unidentified respiratory disease that resulted in the deaths of one of the human cases and the deaths or putting down of 14 of the horses. The virus, isolated by culture from a horse and the kidney of the fatal human case, was initially characterised as a new member of the genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. Comparative sequence analysis of part of the matrix protein gene of the virus and the discovery that the virus had an exceptionally large genome subsequently led to HeV being assigned to a new genus, Henipavirus, along with Nipah virus (a newly emergent virus in pigs). The regular outbreaks of HeV-related disease that have occurred in Australia since 1994 have all been characterised by acute respiratory and neurological manifestations, with high levels of morbidity and mortality in the affected horses and humans. The modes of transmission of HeV remain largely unknown. Although fruit bats have been identified as natural hosts of the virus, direct bat-horse, bat-human or human-human transmission has not been reported. Human infection can occur via exposure to infectious urine, saliva or nasopharyngeal fluid from horses. The treatment options and efficacy are very limited and no vaccine exists. Reports on the outbreaks of HeV in Australia are collated in this review and the available data on the biology, transmission and detection of the pathogen are summarized and discussed.

      Neotropical bats were collected from different life zones in Guatemala in 1983 and 1984 to determine the presence and distribution of antibody against 10 viruses. Bats were collected with mist nets at 13 sites in eight departments and 332 serum specimens were obtained for testing for neutralizing (N) antibody by the plaque-reduction neutralization test. Eighty-seven (26%) of the 332 bats from 16 (38%) of 42 bat species sampled were serologically positive for five of six arboviruses and for two other viruses tested. Antibodies against Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) variant I-A/B, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, vesicular stomatitis, Tacaribe, and Rio Bravo viruses were detected in resident species of bats. However, N antibodies against the enzootic strain of VEE (Mena II, variant I-E) or Nepuyo viruses were not detected.

      Mumps virus (MuV) strains isolated from cerebrospinal fluid and throat swabs from patients in Saitama Prefecture and Tokyo, Japan, from 1997 to 2000 were examined by analyzing the SH gene nucleotide sequence (316-nt). Eighteen of the 20 strains studied were divided into three genotypes, recognized as B, G, and H in previous reports. Two genotypes (G and H) are believed to be new in Japan. Two of the 20 strains belonged to none of the previously reported genotypes (A-I), but were closely related to two known strains, MP94-H and Loug1/UK97. We propose that the two strains identified in this study together with the previously reported strains, MP94-H and Loug1/UK97, form a new genotype, designated J, based on the divergence of the SH gene nucleotide sequences between these four strains and other strains reported (genotypes A-I). Our results also suggest that more than two genotypes circulated in Saitama Prefecture from 1997 to 1999, but only one, genotype G, was in evidence in 2000. Genotype B was earlier reported as the predominant strain in Japan, but it became undetectable by the year 2000. These results provide important epidemiological data on mumps in Japan.

      Samples from 14 free-ranging pampas deer (Ozotoceros bezoarticus celer) were collected in 1995 and 1998, at Campos del Tuyú Wildlife Reserve, Buenos Aires, Argentina. Hematology, serum chemistries, minerals and metals, and fecal parasites were analyzed. In addition, fecal ova and parasites were evaluated seasonally during 1998-2000. Serology for infectious diseases included blue-tongue, brucellosis, bovine respiratory syncytial virus infection, bovine viral diarrhea/mucosal disease, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Johne's disease (paratuberculosis), foot and mouth disease (FMD), leptospirosis (eight serovars), epizootic hemorrhagic disease, and parainfluenza-3 (PI-3). Three (21%) pampas deer had antibodies to Leptospira spp. and six (43%) to PI-3 virus. Serologic results for all other infectious agents were negative. Domestic cattle (n = 27) included in this study for comparison had antibodies to Leptospira, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and PI-3 virus (74-100% of tested animals) and one animal (4%) to Brucella sp. All cattle had antibodies to FMD virus attributable to vaccination. This study provides the first data on the health status of the southernmost sub-species of pampas deer.

      We have used an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to screen the sera and tissues of muskrats (Ondatra zibethica) caught in the northwest of Brandenburg and in the northeast of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, for hantavirus infection. Kidney and/or lung tissue from 6 (3.1%, CI = 1.1-6.5%) out of 197 muskrats were found to be positive for genomic sequences of hantavirus by RT-PCR. We could also demonstrate that 14 (5%, CI = 2.9-8.7%) out of 266 muskrat's sera available for testing contained hantavirus-specific antibodies in IFA. Thus, a total of 8% of the investigated muskrat population was found to be positive for hantavirus infection by RT-PCR and IFA. None of the animals was found positive in both tests. Further analysis of the RT-PCR amplified fragments by genomic sequencing revealed sequences mostly related to the puumala (PUU) S segment sequence of the Hällnäs B1 hantavirus strain (97-99% similarity). Our data therefore demonstrate that Ondatra zibethicus serves as an additional reservoir for puumala-like hantavirus strains in Europe. The epidemiological implications of this finding for hantavirus infection in Europe and elsewhere are discussed.

      To get an insight into Borna disease virus (BDV) epidemiology, an isolated flock of approximately 25 sheep within the region of Southeast Germany to which the disease is endemic was investigated over a 3-year observation period. BDV-specific antibodies and RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected in 12.5 (year 1), 11.5 (year 2), and 19.4% (year 3) and 1.6 (year 1), 0 (year 2), and 14.9% (year 3) of the animals, respectively. BDV persisted in asymptomatic sheep for up to 2 years. Significantly higher numbers of antibody-positive animals were detected seasonally in spring and early summer, the times when usually most of the clinical cases of Borna disease occur. In spring of the third year, numbers of antibody-positive and viral-RNA-positive animals increased significantly despite their having no obvious clinical symptoms. The removal of all antibody- and RNA-positive animals from the flock did not reduce the prevalence of BDV infections in the following year. During a 3-month observation period of three antibody-positive animals, viral RNA was repeatedly detected by reverse transcription-PCR in nasal secretions, saliva, and conjunctival fluids. Sequence analysis revealed clustered nucleotide exchanges among sheep BDV p24 genomes, which differed at five positions from the clustered nucleotide exchanges seen in horse BDV p24 genomes.

      A selection of 10 pestiviruses isolated from sheep from the Iberian Peninsula from 2001 to 2004 was characterised at the molecular level. The 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) and N(pro)-coding gene were amplified by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequenced directly from purified products. All isolates were also typed antigenically with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against representative isolates of the four recognised pestivirus species. The genetic typing placed all the isolates in a new tentative type 4 of border disease virus (BDV), which was closely related to a pestivirus recently found in Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica). Overall, the genotyping indicated a relatively wide diversity of the BDV type 4, which was best defined on the basis of N(pro) sequences. Antigenically, the isolates were recognised by two pan-pestivirus specific anti-NS3 mAbs, but only by some of the anti-glycoprotein specific mAbs raised against BDV, indicating partial antigenic overlap with other BDV isolates.

      We identified sequences from two distantly related papillomaviruses in genital warts from two Burmeister's porpoises, including a PV antigen-positive specimen, and characterized Phocoena spinipinnis papillomavirus type 1 (PsPV-1). The PsPV-1 genome comprises 7879 nt and presents unusual features. It lacks an E7, an E8 and a bona fide E5 open reading frame (ORF) and has a large E6 ORF. PsPV-1 L1 ORF showed the highest percentage of nucleotide identity (54-55 %) with human papillomavirus type 5, bovine papillomavirus type 3 (BPV-3) and Tursiops truncatus papillomavirus type 2 (TtPV-2). This warrants the classification of PsPV-1 as the prototype of the genus Omikronpapillomavirus. PsPV-1 clustered with TtPV-2 in the E6 and E1E2 phylogenetic trees and with TtPV-2 and BPV-3 in the L2L1 tree. This supports the hypothesis that PV evolution may not be monophyletic across all genes.

      A noncytopathic type 1a bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) was isolated from a free-ranging yearling female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) from northwestern Wyoming (USA). The mule deer was emaciated, weak, and salivating, and Arcanobacterium pyogenes was cultured from lung abscesses. Bovine viral diarrhea virus was isolated from lung, however, BVDV antigen was not detected by immunohistochemistry. The BVDV genotype was determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the RNA sequences from the 5'UTR and E2 genes compared with sequences of a type 1a BVDV isolated from cattle from the same area as the deer. The sequences from the deer BVDV were distinct from those of the bovine type 1a BVDV, but similar to other bovine type 1a BVDVs. Seventy-four (60%) of 124 sera collected from mule deer in this area had serum neutralizing antibody titers to type 1a BVDV of > or = 1:32. The high prevalence of seropositive mule deer and isolation of BVDV suggests that this virus circulates in the mule deer population. The isolate described in this report is the second reported BVDV isolate from free-ranging deer in North America and the first from a mule deer.

      In December 2000, an infectious disease spread through a captive breeding group of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Tanzania, killing 49 of 52 animals within 2 months. The causative agent was identified as Canine distemper virus (CDV) by means of histologic examination, virus isolation, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. This report emphasizes the importance of adequate protection against infectious diseases for the successful outcome of captive breeding programs of endangered species.

      From 28 young children in the Netherlands, we isolated a paramyxovirus that was identified as a tentative new member of the Metapneumovirus genus based on virological data, sequence homology and gene constellation. Previously, avian pneumovirus was the sole member of this recently assigned genus, hence the provisional name for the newly discovered virus: human metapneumovirus. The clinical symptoms of the children from whom the virus was isolated were similar to those caused by human respiratory syncytial virus infection, ranging from upper respiratory tract disease to severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Serological studies showed that by the age of five years, virtually all children in the Netherlands have been exposed to human metapneumovirus and that the virus has been circulating in humans for at least 50 years.

      A pig pestivirus isolate, strain H, was characterized by using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and direct sequencing of the amplicons. A duplication of 74 nucleotides was found at the 5' terminus of the 5' noncoding (NC) region, which was also found in RNA isolates from tonsils from two other pigs from the same farm. When the duplication was omitted, the 5' NC region showed 97.8% similarity to bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) strain Korevaar and 94% to BVDV strain Osloss. Furthermore, the rearrangement of the 5' NC region of strain H was maintained after passaging in different cell lines and is not common for ruminant-like pestivirus isolated from pigs. Phylogenetic analysis based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the E2 gene of strain H confirmed the findings of the 5' NC region and show that this strain belongs to the BVDVIb subgroup. These results show for the first time rearrangements in the 5' NC region of a pestivirus.

      Enteroviruses (EVs) are a genetically and antigenically diverse group of viruses infecting humans. A mostly distinct set of EV variants have additionally been documented to infect wild apes and several, primarily captive, Old World monkey (OWM) species. To investigate the prevalence and genetic characteristics of EVs infecting OWMs in the wild, fecal samples from mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) and other species collected in remote regions of southern Cameroon were screened for EV RNA. Remarkably high rates of EV positivity were detected in M. sphinx (100 of 102 screened), Cercocebus torquatus (7/7), and Cercopithecus cephus (2/4), with high viral loads indicative of active infection. Genetic characterization in VP4/VP2 and VP1 regions allowed EV variants to be assigned to simian species H (EV-H) and EV-J (including one or more new types), while seven matched simian EV-B variants, SA5 and EV110 (chimpanzee). Sequences from the remaining 70 formed a new genetic group distinct in VP4/2 and VP1 region from all currently recognized human or simian EV species. Complete genome sequences were obtained from three to determine their species assignment. In common with EV-J and the EV-A A13 isolate, new group sequences were chimeric, being most closely related to EV-A in capsid genes and to EV-B in the nonstructural gene region. Further recombination events created different groupings in 5' and 3' untranslated regions. While clearly a distinct EV group, the hybrid nature of new variants prevented their unambiguous classification as either members of a new species or as divergent members of EV-A using current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) assignment criteria.

      Simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) have been shown to infect many Old World African primate species. Thus far, no work has been published on southern African primates. In this study we investigated the genetic diversity between SIV strains from Kenyan and South African vervets (Cercopithecus aethiops pygerythrus). We amplified and sequenced a 1113 bp region of the env gene. Phylogenetic analysis of these sequences showed that all strains clustered with members of the vervet subgroup of SIVagm. The SIVs from South African vervets differed by 7% from each other and by 8-14% from the Kenyan SIV strains, while the Kenyan SIV strains differed by 10-21% from SIVagm of other east African vervets. We also isolated and sequenced, for the first time, a SIV strain from a healthy chacma baboon (Papio ursinus), caught in South Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of the env region showed the virus to be closely related to the South African vervet SIV strains, while analysis of its pol region confirmed the virus to be a SIVagm variant.

      Two biotypes or variants of rabies virus (RABV) occur in southern Africa. These variants are respectively adapted to hosts belonging to the Canidae family (the canid variant) and hosts belonging to the Herpestidae family (the mongoose variant). Due to the distinct host adaptation and differences in epidemiology and pathogenesis, it has been hypothesized that the two variants were introduced into Africa at different times. The objective of this study was to investigate the molecular phylogeny of representative RABV isolates of the mongoose variant towards a better understanding of the origins of this group. The study was based on an analysis of the full nucleoprotein and glycoprotein gene sequences of a panel of 27 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of this dataset confirmed extended evolutionary adaptation of isolates in specific geographic areas. The evolutionary dynamics of this virus variant was investigated using Bayesian methodology, allowing for rate variation among viral lineages. Molecular clock analysis estimated the age of the African mongoose RABV to be approximately 200 years old, which is in concurrence with literature describing rabies in mongooses since the early 1800 s.

      We isolated a divergent simian T-lymphotropic virus (STLV) (strain PP1664) from a wild-caught African bonobo (pygmy chimpanzee, Pan paniscus). Molecular and phylogenetic characterization of this virus show that it reliably separates from the two well-established primate T-lymphotropic virus types, HTLV-I/STLV-I (PTLV-I) and PTLV-II, and from a third type isolated from an African-born Papio hamadryas and designated by us as PTLV-L. Four of eight bonobos kept at the Antwerp Zoo, Belgium, showed an aberrant PTLV serology. We amplified and sequenced a 709 bp PTLV proviral tax/rex fragment from one of the reactive bonobos. It differs by about 25 % from the homologous nucleotide sequences of PTLV-I and PTLV-L and by about 17 % from PTLV-II. This is comparable to the differences among the three known types. Including the most divergent STLV-I strains sequenced to date, for example, strain PHSu1 sequenced here, the divergence in this region within PTLV-I is less than 11 % and within PTLV-II less than 4%. Although very divergent, this new bonobo STLV is the closest well-characterized simian relative of HTLV-II, raising the possibility of very divergent new HTLV strains. Our results show that the number of PTLV types should be considered open and that the variety of indigenous viruses in the PTLV group is greatest in Africa. Thus, as for the other primate retroviruses HIV and SIV, PTLV most probably has its origins in Africa.

      A novel hantavirus, first detected in Siberian lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus) collected near the Topografov River in the Taymyr Peninsula, Siberia (A. Plyusnin et al., Lancet 347:1835-1836, 1996), was isolated in Vero E6 cells and in laboratory-bred Norwegian lemmings (Lemmus lemmus). The virus, named Topografov virus (TOP), was most closely related to Khabarovsk virus (KBR) and Puumala viruses (PUU). In a cross focus reduction neutralization test, anti-TOP Lemmus antisera showed titers at least fourfold higher with TOP than with other hantaviruses; however, a rabbit anti-KBR antiserum neutralized TOP and KBR at the same titer. The TOP M segment showed 77% nucleotide and 88% amino acid identity with KBR and 76% nucleotide and 82% amino acid identity with PUU. However, the homology between TOP and the KBR S segment was disproportionately higher: 88% at the nucleotide level and 96% at the amino acid level. The 3' noncoding regions of KBR and the TOP S and M segments were alignable except for 113- and 58-nucleotide deletions in KBR. The phylogenetic relationships of TOP, KBR, and PUU and their respective rodent carriers suggest that an exceptional host switch took place during the evolution of these viruses; while TOP and KBR are monophyletic, the respective rodent host species are only distantly related.

      In contrast to most of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, the flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status are probably disseminated only by direct contact with excreta (saliva, urine, feces, etc.); however, as yet undescribed arthropod transmission cycles may be found for some of them. Twenty-two of these flaviviruses, including prototype and recently isolated strains, were compared. Biologic properties were defined by infectivity titrations in suckling mice and Vero, LLC-MK2, and primary Pekin duck embryo cells, and antigenic relationships were defined by complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutralization tests. An antigenic classification scheme is proposed. Antigenic and biologic properties delimit two large clusters. The first, comprising a single antigenic complex, includes those which have yet to be isolated from arthropods, but are likely to be so (Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi and Aroa viruses). The second, encompassing five antigenic complexes, is comprised of viruses which have been isolated exclusively from rodents or bats (Saboya, Carey Island, Dakar bat, Sokuluk, Bukalasa bat, Entebbe bat, Phnom Penh bat, Modoc, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, Rio Bravo, Apoi, Tamana bat and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses) but includes three viruses (Saboya, Sokuluk and Entebbe bat viruses) which may be arthropod-borne, as indicated by replication in mosquito cells in vitro.

      Following howling monkey (Alouatta caraya) deaths and yellow fever (YF) antigen detection by immunohistochemistry in the liver sample of a dead monkey in April and May 2001 in the municipalities of Garruchos and Santo Antônio das Missões, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, epidemiological field investigations were initiated. Two strains of YF virus were isolated in suckling mice from 23 Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus Dyar & Shannon mosquitoes collected from the study sites. The YF virus was isolated from this species in the 1930s in Brazil and in the 1940s in Colombia. No human cases were reported during the current epizootic outbreak. The YF virus isolation and the absence of Hg. (Haemagogus) janthinomys Dyar from the area suggest that Hg. leucocelaenus may be a secondary YF vector and play an important role in the epidemiology of this disease in the Southern Cone.

      We isolated a macropodid herpesvirus from a free-ranging eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteous) displaying clinical signs of respiratory disease and possibly neurologic disease. Sequence analysis of the herpesvirus glycoprotein G (gG) and glycoprotein B (gB) genes revealed that the virus was an alphaherpesvirus most closely related to macropodid herpesvirus 2 (MaHV-2) with 82.7% gG and 94.6% gB amino acid sequence identity. Serologic analyses showed similar cross-neutralization patterns to those of MaHV-2. The two viruses had different growth characteristics in cell culture. Most notably, this virus formed significantly larger plaques and extensive syncytia when compared with MaHV-2. No syncytia were observed for MaHV-2. Restriction endonuclease analysis of whole viral genomes demonstrated distinct restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns for all three macropodid herpesviruses. These studies suggest that a distinct macropodid alphaherpesvirus may be capable of infecting and causing disease in eastern grey kangaroos.

      A case of a 1-month-old Thoroughbred foal with dysphagia, salivation, pyrexia, oral mucosal pustules, and esophageal ulceration is reported. Swabs from the ulcerated lesions yielded Equid herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2) in virus isolation assays, and histopathology of a biopsy from the esophageal lesion identified nuclear inclusions suggestive of herpesviruses. Immunohistochemical staining with antibodies specific for EHV-2 was positive for epithelial cells in the vicinity of the ulcer but not in more distant mucosa. Electron microscopic evaluation of the biopsy showed herpesviral particles in epithelial cells. The foal recovered over 5 days of supportive and gastroprotective therapy, and the esophageal ulcers healed. Serology and immunohistochemistry indicated that this foal likely had lesions associated with EHV-2 and not EHV-1, -4, or -5.

      Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) is a γ-herpesvirus that has been isolated both from apparently healthy animals and from cattle with a variety of clinical signs, including post-partum endometritis and abortion. BoHV-4 causes either a persistent or a latent infection in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Two groups of BoVH-4 strains have been defined based on their restriction patterns: the Movar-like strains (European prototype) and the DN 599-like strains (American prototype). The purpose of the present study was to genetically characterize wild type BoHV-4 strains isolated from vaginal discharges of aborted cows in Argentina. The virus was identified by isolation and nested PCR in all vaginal discharge samples from aborted cows, either as a sole agent or in association with other pathogens. Restriction enzyme profiling and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that there is a high genetic variability among the studied field isolates. The existence of three groups of strains, which were designated as genotypes 1, 2 and 3, is described. Genotypes 1 and 2 possibly correspond to the Movar-like and DN 599-like groups, respectively, whereas Genotype 3 corresponds to a novel group. Two viral strains did not cluster into any of these three groups, indicating that other genotypes could be circulating in Argentina. These results suggest a complex epidemiological background for the Argentinean BoHV-4 strains, probably influenced by independent events of genetic drift. This hypothesis cannot be rejected based on the available data. However, there is no direct evidence supporting this possibility. Thus, it seems speculative to suggest that interspecific jumps are responsible for the observed phylogenetic grouping. On the other hand, our analyses suggest a geographical structure for the observed viral genotypes, since genotypes 1 and 2 included the European (Movar-like) and American (DN599-like) reference strains, respectively. Geographic dispersion is known to be a driver of herpes viruses diversification, and independent evolution in geographical isolated places ensures the emergence of particular mutations in each location due to genetic drift (Compans, 2007; Zong et al., 1999). Therefore, at this point, the genetic drift hypothesis is the one that requires less ad-hoc considerations and thus, to our understanding, is the one that fits to the findings from this study. The involvement of this genetic variability in the detection and pathogenesis of BoHV-4 remains to be investigated.

      Pathologic lesions were summarized in 18 free-ranging cervids (15 moose [Alces alces], two roe deer [Capreolus capreolus], and one red deer [Cervus elaphus]) diagnosed with malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) after examination at the National Veterinary Institute, Oslo 1982-2005. Eye lesions (conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, fibrin clots in the anterior eye chamber) were the most frequent gross finding. Erosive-ulcerative mucosal lesions in the nose and mouth were also commonly found. Histopathology revealed a nonpurulent vasculitis and perivasculitis in the central nervous system (CNS) typical of MCF in 16 of the cases. The diagnosis in the remaining two animals was based upon histologic eye lesions consistent with MCF (CNS not available for examination). Polymerase chain reaction was run on samples from 15 individuals for evidence of MCF-virus DNA, and ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2) DNA was detected in five moose, one roe deer, and one red deer, and caprine herpesvirus-2 (CpHV-2) DNA was detected in two moose and one roe deer. Sera from 1,000 free-ranging cervids were tested for specific antibodies to MCF-associated viruses (MCFV) by competitive inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The seroprevalences were: red deer 5%, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) 4%, roe deer 2%, and moose 0.4% (n = 250 for all four species). The results indicate that sheep and goat MCFV may cause serious disease in wild moose, roe deer, and red deer. The seropositive cervids most likely represent individuals infected with either OvHV-2 or CpHV-2, but may also reflect infections with other related MCFV.

      During July-October 2004, 19 (18 calves, 1 yearling) free-ranging musk oxen (Ovibos moschatus) at Dovre, Norway, were observed with contagious echtyma-like lesions, and 16 of them were euthanized. Six musk oxen were subjected to necropsy, histopathological and microbiological examinations. All euthanized animals had lesions consistent with contagious ecthyma presenting as wart-like, scabby lesions on the muzzle, lips, oral mucosa and limbs to a variable extent. The histopathological examination showed pustular dermatitis characterized by epidermal proliferation, reticular degeneration, degenerating keratinocytes with intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies, vesicopustules, microabscesses and multifocal ulcerations in the epidermis which was covered by a serocellular crust. Pathology and bacteriology showed evidence of secondary infections in the skin and draining lymph nodes. Electron microscopy (negative staining) of lesions from four animals detected parapoxvirus with the typical arrangement of the outer protein filaments. Parapoxvirus DNA was detected in tissue samples from two examined animals by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers from the B2L-gene. A DNA sequence of 326 nucleotides from the amplicon was compared with similar DNA sequences from parapoxvirus isolated from sheep, reindeer, musk ox and cattle. The outbreak was caused by a virus similar to other circulating orf virus variants in Norway. Antibodies against parapoxvirus were detected with a virus neutralization test in 3 of 35 musk oxen (8.6%) sampled at Dovre between 2004 and 2006. This is the first report of a severe outbreak of contagious ecthyma in free-ranging musk oxen.

      Pestiviruses were isolated from three eland (Taurotragus oryx) in Zimbabwe. The viruses were characterised by typing with monoclonal antibodies and by partial genetic sequencing. All were similar to bovine viral diarrhea viruses commonly isolated from cattle. This suggests that bovine viral diarrhea virus can spread from cattle to eland.

      Serological evidence of hepatitis E virus infection (HEV) has been observed in both humans and different animal species living in non-endemic areas, suggesting that animals could be important reservoir for virus transmission to man. Antibodies to HEV have been detected in some Brazilian population groups. Nevertheless, sporadic cases of acute HEV infection have never been reported. We collected 271 serum samples from several domestic animals and also from pig handlers from Southeast of Brazil in order to investigate the seroprevalence of HEV infection. Anti-HEV IgG was detected in cows (1.42%), dogs (6.97%), chickens (20%), swines (24.3%), and rodents (50%), as well as in pig handlers (6.3%). The recognition of swine HEV infections in pigs in many countries of the world led us to investigate a larger sample of pigs (n = 357) from the same Brazilian region with ages ranging from 1 to > 25 weeks. IgG anti-HEV was detected in 100% of 7-day old pigs. Following a gradual decline between weeks 2 and 8 (probably due to loss of maternal IgG), the prevalence then steady increased until it reached 97.3% of animals older than 25 weeks. Besides the detection of anti-HEV antibodies in different animal species, the results showed that swine HEV infection seems to be almost universal within this Brazilian pig population. This is the first report that shows evidences of HEV circulation in Brazilian animal species and pig handlers.

      Simian varicella virus (SVV) was first isolated in 1966 from African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) imported from Nairobi, Kenya, to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the United Kingdom (UK) (Clarkson et al., Arch Gesamte Virusforsch 22:219-234, 1967). SVV infection caused severe disease that resulted in a 56% case fatality rate (CFR) in the imported animals within 48 h of the appearance of a varicella-like rash (Clarkson et al., Arch Gesamte Virusforsch 22:219-234, 1967; Hemme et al., Am J Trop Med Hyg 94:1095-1099, 2016). The deceased animals presented with fever, widespread vesicular rash, and multiple hemorrhagic foci throughout the lungs, liver, and spleen (Clarkson et al., Arch Gesamte Virusforsch 22:219-234, 1967). This outbreak was quickly followed by a second outbreak in 47 patas monkeys (Erythrocebus patas) imported from Chad and Nigeria by Glaxo Laboratories (London, England, UK), which quickly spread within the facility (McCarthy et al., Lancet 2:856-857, 1968).

      Serum and peripheral blood leukocytes from wild yellow baboons (Papio hamadryas cynocephalus) were tested for the presence of STLV-1-specific antibodies and proviral DNA. Fourteen of 30 sera tested positive by radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) with HTLV-1. Among 36 DNA samples tested by PCR 15 were positive by double nested PCR for a fragment of the STLV-1 env gene, the most sensitive assay among PCR tests employed. Of 30 animals that were tested both serologically and by PCR in only 1 case were the results discordant (PCR-positive, antibody-negative). The DNA sequences from env (378 bp), pol (212 bp), and LTR (705 bp) were determined for 5, 5, and 2 Mikumi STLV-1 isolates, respectively. The DNA sequences of Mikumi STLV-1 isolates were virtually identical and phylogenetic analysis revealed that they were clearly distinct from previously published baboon STLV-1 sequences, including those STLV-1 isolates presumed to be from yellow baboons. The results of this study suggest that reliable placement of individual STLV-1 within the PTLV-1 phylogeny requires genomic sequences of STLV-1 isolates from wild animals whose taxonomic identity and geographical origin are firmly established and that the LTR is the genomic region of STLV-1 which is the most informative for cladistic analysis of these viruses.

      This study investigated the geographic distribution and prevalence of antibodies to California and Bunyamwera serogroup viruses in Native populations of Alaska, and demographic and ecologic risk factors associated with exposure. Sera (n = 1,635) from 18 communities were screened using an ELISA. All age groups were tested for antibodies to Jamestown Canyon (JC), Inkoo (INK), snowshoe hare (SSH), and Northway (NOR) viruses; persons > or = 45 years old (n = 90) from six communities were additionally tested for antibodies to Tahyna (TAH), Batai (BAT), Cache Valley (CV), and Sindbis (SIN) viruses. Thirty free-ranging mammals were tested by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) for antibodies to all eight viruses and to Getah (GET) virus. In Natives, overall antibody prevalence was 24.9% (JC = 17.6%, monotypic JC = 6.5%, INK = 11.1%, monotypic INK = 0.6%, SSH = 6.8%, monotypic SSH = 3.5%, and NOR = 6.2%). Five TAH, CV, and BAT virus exposures may be serologic cross-reactions, and no SIN virus antibodies were detected. Sindbis-like virus antibodies were found in 30% of the mammals. Most mammals had antibodies to NOR (83.3%) and California serogroup (70.0%) viruses; no GET virus exposures were found. Significant risk factors for human bunyavirus exposures were age group, ethnic-linguistic group, biotic province, climate zone, terrestrial vegetation, and presence of some ungulates and small mammals in communities. Sex was not a significant risk factor.

      Two newly recognized parvovirus species, rat parvovirus 1 (RPV-1) and rat minute virus 1 (RMV-1), were recently identified in naturally infected rats. In this study, two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed to specifically detect RPV-1 and RMV-1. The RPV-1 PCR assay amplified the expected 487-bp deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragment only in the presence of RPV-1 DNA; the RMV-1 PCR assay amplified the expected 843-bp product only from RMV-1 DNA, not from other rodent parvoviruses. The RPV-1 and the RMV-1 PCR assays detected approximately 18 and 70 copies of DNA template, respectively. These two PCR assays were shown to be sensitive, specific and rapid methods for detecting RPV-1 and RMV-1 infections in rats. These assays may also be valuable for evaluation of biological specimens for parvovirus contamination.

      Rodent parvoviruses have been documented to interfere with both in vivo and in vitro research. In this study, three rat parvoviruses distinct from previously characterized rodent parvoviruses were identified from naturally infected rats obtained from four discrete sources. These three newly recognized parvoviruses were designated rat minute virus (RMV)-1a, -1b and -1c. In this study, the genomic nucleotide sequence and the predicted amino acid sequences of proteins for each of the three RMV-1 variants and Kilham rat virus (KRV) were determined and compared with previously characterized rodent parvoviruses. The three RMV-1 variants were shown to be closely related to each other, to be distinct from but closely related to KRV and H-1 virus, and to be significantly different from the previously identified rat parvovirus isolate, RPV-1a.

      The antigenic and genetic properties of 46 hantaviruses from China, 13 from patients, 23 from rodents, and 10 from unknown hosts, were compared with those of other hantaviruses. The viruses were classified as either Hantaan (HTN) or Seoul (SEO) viruses. A phylogenetic analysis of the partial M (300 bp) and S (around 485 bp) genomes of HTN viruses identified nine distinct genetic subtypes, one consisting of isolates from Korea. The SEO viruses were divided into five genetic subtypes, although they had less variability than the HTN subtypes. There was a correlation between the subtype and province of origin for four subtypes of HTN viruses, confirming geographical clustering. Hantaan virus NC167 isolated from Niviventer confucianus and SEO virus Gou3 isolated from Rattus rattus were the basal clades in each virus. The phylogenetic trees constructed from the entire S and M segments suggested that NC167 was introduced to N. confucianus in a host-switching event. The reactivity of a panel of 35 monoclonal antibodies was almost exactly the same in NC167 and a representative HTN virus and in Gou3 and a representative SEO virus. However, there was a one-way cross-neutralization between them. These results confirm the varied nature of Murinae-associated hantaviruses in China.

      In this study, we review annual rabies data from Massachusetts from 1985 to 2006, spanning the introduction of raccoon strain rabies in 1992. Of 52,034 animals tested, 9.7% (5,049/52,034) were rabid, representing 26 of over 67 species submitted. Bats were the most common rabid animals prior to 1992 (50 of 52), but raccoons (Procyon lotor) became the most common rabies-positive species upon arrival of raccoon strain rabies virus (38.2%, 2,728 of 7,138 tested), followed by striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis, 34.4%, 1,489 of 4,332), bats (5.3%, 427 of 8,053), foxes (red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and gray fox, Urocyon cinereoargenteus, 16.3%, 135 of 827), cats (0.8%, 136 of 18,050), and woodchucks (Marmota monax, 5.7%, 82 of 1,446). Cats were the most frequently tested animal (34.7%). Raccoon strain rabies spread from two foci of introduction with an initial epizootic phase of 4 yr, by which time most of the state was affected. In 1992, there was a transition from enzootic bat rabies, with little spillover to other animals, to terrestrial rabies associated with raccoon strain virus. Although raccoons were most affected by the raccoon strain virus, there was spillover to other species, particularly to skunks. The eastern United States raccoon rabies epizootic led to a marked increase in submissions for rabies testing and the number of positive animals detected; however, bat rabies cases remained at their previous levels. Wild animal rabies presents a significant threat to humans and domestic/companion animals and increased costs related to increased demand for rabies testing, postexposure prophylaxis as well as euthanasia of valuable domestic animals.

      Virological testing and monitoring is a fundamental part of quality control of experimental animals. However, there are few papers regarding the spectrum and status of natural infection in wild tree shrews with human and animal pathogenic viruses. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent adsorption assay (ELISA), we tested sixty wild tree shrews captured from Qinglong, an outskirt region of Kunming, Yunnan Province, China for eleven viruses, including herpes simplex virus, coxsackie virus, influenza virus, HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, dengue virus, hemorrhagic fever virus and measles virus. Our results showed that, in the serum samples, 22/60 (36.7%) and 1/60 (1.67%) were antibody positive for herpes simplex virus and coxsackie virus, respectively, and 4/60 (6.7%) were antigen positive for rotavirus in the feces. The remaining species of viruses were negative in these tree shrews. Based on these results, we propose that herpes simplex virus, coxsackie virus and cotavirus should be listed as top priority for routine virological monitoring of tree shrews.

      We review the literature and discuss control options regarding foot and mouth disease (FMD) in wildlife around the world. There are more than 100 species of wild, feral, laboratory, or domesticated animals that have been infected naturally or experimentally with FMD virus. Apart from the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in sub-Saharan Africa, wildlife has not been demonstrated to play a significant role in the maintenance of FMD. More often, wildlife are passively infected when outbreaks of FMD occur in domestic livestock, and, in some wild ungulates, infection results in severe disease. Efforts to control FMD in wildlife may not be successful when the disease is endemic in livestock and may cause more harm to wildlife, human livelihoods, and domestic animals. Currently in sub-Saharan Africa, the complete eradication of FMD on a subcontinental scale in the near term is not possible, given the presence of FMD-infected African buffalo and the existence of weak veterinary infrastructures in some FMD-endemic countries. Therefore efforts to control the disease should be aimed at improved vaccines and improved use of vaccines, improved livestock management practices, and utilization of programs that can help in disease control such as the FMD Progressive Control Program and regulatory frameworks that facilitate trade such zonation, compartmentalization, and commodity-based trade. Though not meeting the definition of wildlife used in this review, feral domestic animals warrant a special concern with regard to FMD control.

      Natural infection with Machupo and Latino viruses occurs only in the cricetine rodent Calomys callosus. Machupo virus induces fatal infection in suckling mice and hamsters, and in adult guinea-pigs, marmosets, and rhesus monkeys. Latino virus kills only suckling hamsters; it produces chronic but non-viraemic infection in Calomys rodents.Machupo virus, in contrast, induces a viraemic immunotolerant infection in suckling Calomys, and a split response in animals more than 9 days of age. Tolerant infection is associated with haemolytic anaemia and splenomegaly, lesions not observed in animals able to clear viraemia and produce circulating neutralizing antibodies. Experimental increase in the fraction of tolerant response was obtained by decreasing the virus dose or by phenotypic inbreeding of rodents. Long-term effects of tolerant infection included mild runting, decreased survival time, and almost total sterility among females, largely caused by fatal virus infection of embryos.

      Sera obtained from wild ungulates, carnivores, and rodents in Colorado were tested for neutralizing (N) antibody against vesicular stomatitis, New Jersey serotype (VSNJ), virus to determine their involvement in the 1982 Colorado VSNJ epizootic in domestic animals. Viremic and N antibody responses of two local rodent species to a 1982 Colorado isolate of VSNJ were determined in the laboratory. The rodents produced only weak viremias, but all developed N antibody. N antibody prevalences for VSNJ in sera from wild ungulates was sufficiently high to indicate their involvement during the epizootic. In addition, the demonstration of N antibody in elk (Cervus elaphus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) prior to the epizootic in cattle and horses suggests that an enzootic cycle may exist in Colorado.

      A total of 474 specimens from 157 rodents caught at the military training area of Boletice in the south of the Czech Republic from May to November 1999 were screened for TBEV by nested PCR. TBEV-specific RNA was amplified from lung, kidney, and spleen derived from one Clethrionomys glareolus in the first RT-PCR round. Sequence analysis revealed a 100% identity to the TBEV strain Neudoerfl. TBEV presence in the sample was confirmed by mouse brain passage of backup samples and cell culture. The results support the observation that hantaviruses and TBEV transmission can occur sympatrically in the same rodent population.

      In a survey of seven species of wild rodents (n = 423) collected between October 1993 and March 1994 from the three principal ecological biomes of North Carolina (USA), we found hantavirus antibodies in seven (2%) of 301 Peromyscus spp. Hantavirus antibodies were detected in P. leucopus and P. maniculatus captured from mountain and coastal island biomes. Three mice were positive for Sin Nombre virus, while four others had antibodies to Seoul virus or a related agent. Two mice serologically positive for Sin Nombre virus were collected from inside a private mountain domicile. We conclude that the risk of human exposure to hantaviruses in North Carolina resembles that for most other areas of the continental United States.

      A wildlife sanctuary presented an adult female cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.), age unknown, to the Colorado State University Pathology service for postmortem examination. Gross examination revealed numerous pigmented wartlike lesions arising from the skin of the head surrounding the ears, eyes, nares, mouth, and dorsum. Masses were firm, friable, and easily detached from the underlying skin. Differential diagnoses included Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus, Rabbit fibroma virus, and Myxoma virus. Histological examination revealed multiple papillary masses lined by stratified squamous epithelial cells with central cores of fibrovascular connective tissue and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis. Cells of the Stratum spinosum were frequently swollen with abundant perinuclear, cytoplasmic, clearing, and occasional intranuclear basophilic, glassy, spherical inclusions up to 3 microm in diameter. The lesions were consistent with Cottontail rabbit papillomavirus infection. Papilloma virus antigens were identified by immunohistochemistry. In addition, papillomavirus particles were identified by transmission electron microscopy within Langerhans cells of the epidermis, suggesting a unique mechanism for systemic dissemination of the virus. The present case report highlights the finding of viral particles within the Langerhans cells and suggests a novel mechanism of pathogenesis.

      A serological survey was conducted in 1985-1987 to determine the presence of infection for Hantavirus in the general population in Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia, as well as among rodent-exposed laboratory workers in Argentina. Out of 748 individuals tested by immunofluorescence 20 proved positive for Hantaan virus 76/118 strain of whom 16 also reacted against Seoul virus 80/39 strain and 2 against Puumala virus Sotkamo strain. Ten out of 72 Argentine laboratory workers were positive for the first 2 viruses by ELISA, immunofluorescence and/or plaque reduction neutralization test, in 4 of whom recent infection was demonstrated by IgM antibody presence. Inapparent Hantavirus infection was thus demonstrated for the first time in 2.7% of regional inhabitants, together with 13.9% among rodent-exposed laboratory workers. Our data established the existence of human Hantavirus infection nearly 10 years before the recognition of clinical cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina.

      The orthoreoviruses are segmented RNA viruses that infect diverse vertebrate host species. While the most common human orthoreovirus, Mammalian Reovirus, is not typically associated with significant disease, the majority of Orthoreovirus species have been shown to cause significant and often fatal disease in reptiles, birds, and primates. There is significant potential for jumping species. A consensus nested-PCR method was designed for investigation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene of Orthoreovirus and Aquareovirus. This protocol was used to obtain sequencing template from reoviruses of three different vertebrate classes. Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis found that all viruses analyzed clustered in the genus Orthoreovirus, that reptile reoviruses formed three distinct clusters, and that an African grey parrot reovirus clustered with Nelson Bay virus from bats. This PCR method may be useful for obtaining templates for initial sequencing of novel orthoreoviruses from diverse vertebrate hosts.

      A virus was isolated from aborted dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) fetuses during an abortion storm in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Laboratory investigations showed the causative agent to be indistinguishable from equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), a picornavirus. Two pregnant dromedaries experimentally infected with the camel virus isolate both aborted and an identical virus was reisolated from both fetuses, thus confirming the diagnosis. The extremely high prevalence of antibody (>90 %) and the high titres recorded against ERAV in the dromedary herd clearly showed that ERAV does infect dromedaries. Unlike horses, where ERAV targets the upper respiratory tract, in dromedaries the target organ appears to be the genital tract.

      Adenoviruses (AdVs) broadly infect vertebrate hosts, including a variety of nonhuman primates (NHPs). In the present study, we identified AdVs in NHPs living in their natural habitats, and through the combination of phylogenetic analyses and information on the habitats and epidemiological settings, we detected possible horizontal transmission events between NHPs and humans. Wild NHPs were analyzed with a pan-primate AdV-specific PCR using a degenerate nested primer set that targets the highly conserved adenovirus DNA polymerase gene. A plethora of novel AdV sequences were identified, representing at least 45 distinct AdVs. From the AdV-positive individuals, 29 nearly complete hexon genes were amplified and, based on phylogenetic analysis, tentatively allocated to all known human AdV species (Human adenovirus A to Human adenovirus G [HAdV-A to -G]) as well as to the only simian AdV species (Simian adenovirus A [SAdV-A]). Interestingly, five of the AdVs detected in great apes grouped into the HAdV-A, HAdV-D, HAdV-F, or SAdV-A clade. Furthermore, we report the first detection of AdVs in New World monkeys, clustering at the base of the primate AdV evolutionary tree. Most notably, six chimpanzee AdVs of species HAdV-A to HAdV-F revealed a remarkably close relationship to human AdVs, possibly indicating recent interspecies transmission events.

      While hemoplasma infections in domestic cats are well studied, almost no information is available on their occurrence in wild felids. The aims of the present study were to investigate wild felid species as possible reservoirs of feline hemoplasmas and the molecular characterization of the hemoplasma isolates. Blood samples from the following 257 wild felids were analyzed: 35 Iberian lynxes from Spain, 36 Eurasian lynxes from Switzerland, 31 European wildcats from France, 45 lions from Tanzania, and 110 Brazilian wild felids, including 12 wild felid species kept in zoos and one free-ranging ocelot. Using real-time PCR, feline hemoplasmas were detected in samples of the following species: Iberian lynx, Eurasian lynx, European wildcat, lion, puma, oncilla, Geoffroy's cat, margay, and ocelot. ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum"" was the most common feline hemoplasma in Iberian lynxes, Eurasian lynxes, Serengeti lions, and Brazilian wild felids, whereas ""Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis"" was the most prevalent in European wildcats; hemoplasma coinfections were frequently observed. Hemoplasma infection was associated with species and free-ranging status of the felids in all animals and with feline leukemia virus provirus-positive status in European wildcats. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16S rRNA and the partial RNase P gene revealed that most hemoplasma isolates exhibit high sequence identities to domestic cat-derived isolates, although some isolates form different subclusters within the phylogenetic tree. In conclusion, 9 out of 15 wild felid species from three different continents were found to be infected with feline hemoplasmas. The effect of feline hemoplasma infections on wild felid populations needs to be further investigated.

      Although foamy viruses (Spumaviruses) have repeatedly been isolated from both healthy and diseased cats, cattle, and primates, the primary mode of transmission of those common viruses remains undefined. A database of the feline foamy virus (FeFV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibody status, age, and sex of 389 domestic cats presented to veterinarians was assembled. A similar database for 66 feral (wild) cats was also assembled. That FeFV antibody status reflects infection was validated by PCR. Both FeFV and FIV infection rates were found to gradually increase with age, and over 70% of cats older than 9 years were seropositive for FeFV. In domestic cats, the prevalence of FeFV infection was similar in both sexes. In feral cats, FeFV infection was more prevalent in female cats than in male cats. Although both FeFV and FIV have been reported to be transmitted by biting, the patterns of infection observed are more consistent with an interpretation that transmission of these two retroviruses is not the same. The prevalence of FIV infection is highest in nondesexed male cats, the animals most likely to display aggressive behavior. The gradual increase in the proportion of FeFV-infected animals is consistent with transmission of foamy viruses by intimate social contact between animals and less commonly by aggressive behavior.

      Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), a fatal viral disease of cattle and other large ruminants, has a worldwide distribution. There are two forms of the disease, one of which, is caused by Alcelaphine herpesvirus-1 (AHV-1) and is derived from wildebeest. The other form is associated with domestic sheep and is caused by ovine herpesvirus-2 (OHV-2). The disease in Indonesia is sheep-associated with the preferred livestock of this area, Balinese cattle (Bos javanicus) and water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), both highly susceptible to SA-MCF. The incidence in these species is thought to be high but the prevalence and economic losses attributable to SA-MCF have been difficult to assess. a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, based on a cloned OHV-2 gene sequence, was successfully applied to the detection of OHV-2 DNA in normal sheep and animals affected with SA-MCF. OHV-2 DNA was detected in eleven confirmed cases of SA-MCF and in the peripheral blood leucocyte (PBL) fraction of six latently infected sheep. These findings have confirmed that the PCR can be of value in establishing a diagnosis of MCF and that the aetiological agent of MCF in Indonesia is OHV-2. The amplification of DNA from the PBL of goats suggests that they are infected with a similar or identical herpesvirus.

      The Erve virus is suspected to cause severe headache in humans, lasting several days (thunderclap headache). Mice are characterized as a probable reservoir for the Erve virus. We tested 396 wild mice for Erve virus using an immunofluorescence test and found Erve virus antibodies in five cases, showing that small mammals form a reservoir for Erve virus. If ticks are the vector for the virus, a coincidence with borreliosis should exist. We were unable to confirm this in a homogeneous cohort of 955 young men, 62 of whom tested positive for borreliosis. This group did not test positive significantly more often in the immunofluorescence test than a gender- and age-matched control group.

      In a zoological collection, four black bears (Ursus americanus) died from neurological disease within six months. Independently in a geographically different zoo, two Thomson's gazelles (Eudorcas thomsoni) and 18 guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus f. dom.) suffered from neurological disorders. In addition, guinea pigs showed abortions and stillbirths. All affected animals displayed a non suppurative meningoencephalitis with intranuclear inclusion bodies. Immunohistology demonstrated equine herpes virus antigen and ultrastructurally herpes viral particles were detected. Virus isolation and molecular analysis identified neurotropic equine herpesvirus (EHV) 1 strains in both epizootics. There is serological evidence of a possible virus transmission from other equids to the affected animals. Cross-species transmission of EHV-1 should be considered in the management of captive wild equids and ungulates, particularly with respect to fatal disease in irreplaceable species.

      The human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) types 1 and 2 originated independently and are related to distinct lineages of simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLV-1 and STLV-2, respectively). These facts, along with the finding that HTLV-1 diversity appears to have resulted from multiple cross-species transmissions of STLV-1, suggest that contact between humans and infected nonhuman primates (NHPs) may result in HTLV emergence. We investigated the diversity of HTLV among central Africans reporting contact with NHP blood and body fluids through hunting, butchering, and keeping primate pets. We show that this population is infected with a wide variety of HTLVs, including two previously unknown retroviruses: HTLV-4 is a member of a phylogenetic lineage that is distinct from all known HTLVs and STLVs; HTLV-3 falls within the phylogenetic diversity of STLV-3, a group not previously seen in humans. We also document human infection with multiple STLV-1-like viruses. These results demonstrate greater HTLV diversity than previously recognized and suggest that NHP exposure contributes to HTLV emergence. Our discovery of unique and divergent HTLVs has implications for HTLV diagnosis, blood screening, and potential disease development in infected persons. The findings also indicate that cross-species transmission is not the rate-limiting step in pandemic retrovirus emergence and suggest that it may be possible to predict and prevent disease emergence by surveillance of populations exposed to animal reservoirs and interventions to decrease risk factors, such as primate hunting.

      Wild populations of nonhuman primates live in regions of sylvatic arbovirus transmission. To assess the status of arbovirus transmission in Bornean forests and the susceptibility of wild orangutans to arboviral infection, blood samples of wild orangutans, semi-captive orangutans, and humans were examined. Samples were tested by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to viruses representing three families (Flaviviridae, Alphaviridae, and Bunyaviridae), including dengue-2, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Langat, Tembusu, Sindbis, Chikungunya, and Batai viruses. Both wild and semi-captive orangutan groups as well as local human populations showed serologic evidence of arbovirus infection. The presence of neutralizing antibodies among wild orangutans strongly suggests the existence of sylvatic cycles for dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and sindbis viruses in North Borneo. The present study demonstrates that orangutans are susceptible to arboviralinfections in the wild, although the impact of arboviral infections on this endangered ape remain unknown.

      We isolated Cowpox virus (CPXV) from the ulcerative eyelid lesions of a 14-year-old girl, who had cared for a clinically ill wild rat that later died. CPXV isolated from the rat (Rattus norvegicus) showed complete homology with the girl's virus. Our case is the first proven rat-to-human transmission of cowpox.

      Amongst the 60 viral species reported to be associated with bats, 59 are RNA viruses, which are potentially important in the generation of emerging and re-emerging infections in humans. The prime examples of these are the lyssaviruses and Henipavirus. The transmission of Nipah, Hendra and perhaps SARS coronavirus and Ebola virus to humans may involve intermediate amplification hosts such as pigs, horses, civets and primates, respectively. Understanding of the natural reservoir or introductory host, the amplifying host, the epidemic centre and at-risk human populations are crucial in the control of emerging zoonosis. The association between the bat coronaviruses and certain lyssaviruses with particular bat species implies co-evolution between specific viruses and bat hosts. Cross-infection between the huge number of bat species may generate new viruses which are able to jump the trans-mammalian species barrier more efficiently. The currently known viruses that have been found in bats are reviewed and the risks of transmission to humans are highlighted. Certain families of bats including the Pteropodidae, Molossidae, Phyllostomidae, and Vespertilionidae are most frequently associated with known human pathogens. A systematic survey of bats is warranted to better understand the ecology of these viruses.

      Three isolates of bovine astrovirus, one from the United Kingdom and two from the United States, possessed common antigens by immunofluorescence and strain-specific antigens by neutralization and were designated as two, and probably three, distinct serotypes. The isolate US2, despite being a different serotype, possessed the same restrictive cell tropism and cytopathology as previously reported for isolate US1, of the M cells of the dome epithelium of the Peyer's patches. Serotyping of 16 field isolates indicated the presence of more undefined serotypes.

      Seventeen counties in northern California experienced epizootics of high mortality in the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) population during the latter half of 1993. Thirteen deer submitted to the California Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System as part of this natural die-off had systemic adenovirus infection. Pulmonary edema was present in all 13 deer. Erosions, ulceration, and abscessation of the upper alimentary tract occurred in 7/13 deer. Four of 13 deer had hemorrhagic enteritis. All 13 deer had widespread systemic vasculitis with endothelial intranuclear inclusions. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody directed against bovine adenovirus type 5 bound to antigen in endothelial cells. Adenovirus was identified by transmission electron microscopy within the nuclei of endothelial cells in 6/6 deer examined. An adenovirus was isolated from lung homogenates of one deer that were cultured on black-tailed deer pulmonary artery endothelial cells. With the exception of the intranuclear inclusions evident on histologic evaluation, gross and histologic changes were similar to those described for bluetongue virus infection and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus infection in white-tailed deer. Nine additional deer were emaciated and had pharyngeal abscesses with focal vasculitis, which may represent the chronic affects of previous nonfatal adenovirus infection.

      A total of 1,385 stool specimens were collected from children with diarrhea at two hospitals in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in 1994 and 1995, and screened for rotavirus by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of viral RNA. Group A rotavirus was detected with high frequency; 56.5% (87/154) and 40.8% (502/1,231) of the specimens collected in 1994 and 1995, respectively, were positive for rotavirus. Assignment of G serotype and P type (VP4 genotype) of group A rotavirus by ELISA with monoclonal antibodies and/or PCR, respectively, showed that strains of G2-P[4] and G1-P[8] specificity were predominant in 1994 and in 1995, respectively. In contrast, a single strain was found to have a P[9] type specificity, and no G4 strain was detected. Unusual combinations of RNA pattern-subgroup-G serotype-P type, such as long pattern-subgroup I-G1-P[8], short pattern-subgroup II-G3-P[4] and short pattern-subgroup I-G1-P[4], were detected in four specimens. Nucleotide sequences of the VP8* and/or NSP5 genes from two Chinese P[8] strains 470 and 582 and one Chinese P[9] strain 512 as well as five Japanese P[9] strains (K8, AU1, M318, 0264, and 0265) were determined and compared with the published sequences of the corresponding gene. In the phylogenetic tree of VP8* sequences of P[9] strains, which formed two clusters each having strain K8 or AU-1 as the representative strain, the Chinese P[9] strain was found in the cluster represented by AU-1, although it was most distantly related to other strains. While NSP5 sequences of human strains with P[9] specificity were related to simian and bovine strains, that of Chinese P[8] strains was most closely related to those of porcine strains. A single group C rotavirus (No. 208) was detected. Nucleotide sequences of its VP4, VP6, VP7, and NSP4 genes were very similar to those of group C human rotaviruses detected worldwide.

      Rodents were trapped in the Benue-Plateau and North-Eastern States of Nigeria where Lassa fever had been reported in previous years. Eight Lassa virus strains were isolated from tissues and blood of rodents identified in the field as being of 3 different species: Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus, and Mus minutoides. All the infected rodents were collected in village habitats. These isolations indicate the presence of Lassa virus in wild rodents in Nigeria during periods when no human infections were evident.Prior studies in Sierra Leone have indicated that a single rodent species, M. natalensis, may be the important reservoir host of Lassa virus. Since the present study indicates that other rodent species may be involved as well, the ecology of Lassa virus may be more complicated than was heretofore supposed. In view of the importance of determining the geographic and species range of rodent hosts of Lassa virus, and because of the problems inherent in rodent identification under austere field conditions, it is urgent that further studies be conducted in the same areas of Nigeria to confirm these findings.

      The complete sequence of adeno-associated virus type 1 (AAV-1) was defined. Its genome of 4,718 nucleotides demonstrates high homology with those of other AAV serotypes, including AAV-6, which appears to have arisen from homologous recombination between AAV-1 and AAV-2. Analysis of sera from nonhuman and human primates for neutralizing antibodies (NAB) against AAV-1 and AAV-2 revealed the following. (i) NAB to AAV-1 are more common than NAB to AAV-2 in nonhuman primates, while the reverse is true in humans; and (ii) sera from 36% of nonhuman primates neutralized AAV-1 but not AAV-2, while sera from 8% of humans neutralized AAV-2 but not AAV-1. An infectious clone of AAV-1 was isolated from a replicated monomer form, and vectors were created with AAV-2 inverted terminal repeats and AAV-1 Rep and Cap functions. Both AAV-1- and AAV-2-based vectors transduced murine liver and muscle in vivo; AAV-1 was more efficient for muscle, while AAV-2 transduced liver more efficiently. Strong NAB responses were detected for each vector administered to murine skeletal muscle; these responses prevented readministration of the same serotype but did not substantially cross-neutralize the other serotype. Similar results were observed in the context of liver-directed gene transfer, except for a significant, but incomplete, neutralization of AAV-1 from a previous treatment with AAV-2. Vectors based on AAV-1 may be preferred in some applications of human gene therapy.

      Poxvirus infections affecting the skin of cats are extremely rare in North America, in contrast to Europe where cowpox virus is well recognized as an accidental pathogen in cats that hunt small rodents. The virus or viruses responsible for the anecdotal cases in North America have never been characterized. This paper reports a case of raccoonpox infection in a Canadian cat. Biopsy of the initial ulcerative lesion on the forepaw revealed ballooning degeneration of surface and follicular keratinoctyes. Infected cells contained large eosinophilic type A inclusions. Electron microscopic examination revealed virions of an orthopoxvirus, subsequently identified as raccoonpox by polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing. The cat made a full recovery.

      Tioman virus, a relatively new paramyxovirus, was isolated from fruit bats (Pteropus species) on Tioman Island, Malaysia, in 2001. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies to T. virus in island inhabitants, by use of comparative ELISA and serum neutralization assays. Of the 169 human sera analyzed, 5 (approximately 3.0%) were positive for T. virus, by comparative ELISA. Of these 5 sera, 3 (1.8% of the total) had neutralizing antibodies against T. virus, suggesting previous infection of this study population by this virus or a similar virus.

      Aichi virus was isolated in Vero cells from 5 (2.3%) of 222 Pakistani children with gastroenteritis but none was found in 91 healthy children. Aichi virus was also isolated from 5 (0.7%) of 722 Japanese travelers returned from tours to Southeast Asian countries and complained of gastrointestinal symptoms at the quarantine station of Nagoya International Airport in Japan. Of 5 Japanese travelers, 3 were returning from Indonesia, and 2 from Thailand or Malaysia. These results indicate that Aichi virus or a similar agent is endemic in Southeast Asian countries and is a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms in children in these areas or in Japanese travelers who visit there.

      We found serological evidence of infection with Prospect Hill virus, a Hantaan-like virus isolated from meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), in microtine and cricetid rodents trapped in Maryland, West Virginia, Minnesota and California, USA. Fluorescent antibodies were detected in sera from M. pennsylvanicus (74/277), M. californicus (39/185), Clethrionomys gapperi (5/51), Peromyscus maniculatus (4/22) and P. truei (1/11). Sera from seropositive P. maniculatus contained neutralizing antibodies against Prospect Hill virus, confirming that infection with Prospect Hill virus or antigenically related viruses is not restricted to microtine rodents in the USA. Despite the widespread distribution of Prospect Hill virus in indigenous rodents, the recent demonstration that American mammalogists are only rarely infected supports the view that the overall risk of Prospect Hill virus infection in man is low.

      Three strains of nephropathia epidemica (NE) virus were isolated from lung tissues of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and a grey-sided vole (C. rufocanus) trapped in Västerbotten county, Sweden. Two of these isolates were serially passaged in seronegative laboratory-bred bank voles. Experimentally infected animals developed a subclinical infection characterized by virus persistence, particularly in lung tissue. Attempts to infect other species of colonized rodents with NE virus and to isolate NE virus from acute phase patient blood were unsuccessful. The serial propagation of NE virus in colonized bank voles provides opportunities to study experimental infection in its reservoir rodent host.

      In 1999, two viruses were isolated from blood samples of sentinel cattle in the Western part of Japan. The physiochemical and morphological properties of these viruses indicated that they belonged to the family Bunyaviridae. Sequence analysis of the S segment indicates that the two viruses are closely related to Sathuperi virus (SATV). The N-terminal 168 amino acid of the G2 protein of the M segment was highly homologous with that of SATV (98.2%). Given these results, we conclude that the newly isolated viruses are closest to SATV, which was initially isolated in India and Nigeria over 30 years ago.

      Six virus isolations were made from Culicoides biting midges and blood samples of sentinel cattle in Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures, the southern part of Japan, in 2002. Serological and genetical tests identified these viruses as isolates of Shamonda virus (SHAV), which belongs to the Simbu group of the genus Orthobunyavirus of the family Bunyaviridae. Initially, SHAV was isolated from cattle and Culicoides biting midges in Nigeria in the 1960s, and its presence has not been reported until this study. The present results indicate a wider distribution of SHAV than previously assumed.

      A total of 804 goat sera were collected from 144 goat farms in five regions of South Korea during a period between 2005 and 2006 and screened for the antibodies of viral pathogens in ruminants. The individual seropositive rates for each virus were 13.7% (110/804) for bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), 9.5% (76/804) for bovine parainfluenza type-3 virus (PI-3V), 5.5% (44/804) for Akabane virus (AKAV), 13.3% (107/804) for Aino virus (AINV), 2.0% (16/804) for Chuzan virus (CHUV) and 1.0% (8/804) for bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Compared with other areas, Chungcheong Province showed higher seropositive rates of 13.6% for PI-3V, 22.3% for AKAV and 28.2% for AINV. The results indicate that among the six viral diseases, BHV-1 infection is quite prevalent, while BCoV infection is less prevalent on domestic goat farms in Gyeongsang and Jeonla Provinces.

      In August 2008, forty dogs out of 400 developed oral warts in a breeding farm in Korea. Canine oral papilloma infection is a common disease in dogs. However, there has been no report of an outbreak of canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) in a group of dogs or in dog breeding farms in Korea, and the genetic analysis of COPV in Korea has yet to be performed. This study diagnosed canine oral papilloma from the oral samples of these dogs based on histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry. Polymerase chain reaction was applied to amplify the corresponding products using preexisting primer sets for COPV and a universal human papillomavirus targeting L1 gene. Further genetic analysis of the major viral capsid gene L1 confirms the sequences of Korean COPV, which shows a close relationship to previously reported COPV. This study describes the histopathological and immunohistochemical characteristics of canine oral papilloma in a group of breeding dogs in Korea and discloses the complete L1 gene sequences of Korean COPV.

      A novel parvovirus was identified in Manchurian chipmunks inhabiting Korea. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in sera from 4 animals among 62 apparently healthy chipmunks. Electron microscopic examination of the HBsAg-positive sera revealed virus-like spherical particles 20-22 nm in diameter. Extraction of nucleic acid under annealing conditions from the serum samples containing virus-like particles yielded a single species of DNA molecule with the electrophoretic mobility of 5.6-kb double-stranded DNA. Four overlapping clones that encompassed almost the full-length viral genome, except both ends, were obtained. By sequencing these clones, we determined the sequence of 5097 nucleotides of the viral DNA. Two open reading frames were identified, with the left side open reading frame encoding a putative nonstructural protein and the right side open reading frame encoding a putative capsid protein. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed significant homology to parvovirus B19 and simian parvovirus, but showed little homology to other mammalian autonomous parvoviruses or adeno-associated viruses. These observations indicate that the virus isolated from Manchurian chipmunks is a novel parvovirus and may be a potentially useful animal model of human B19 infection as a new member of the Erythrovirus genus of the Parvoviridae.

      Wolves (Canis lupus) were captured in three areas of Interior Alaska (USA). Four hundred twenty-five sera were tested for evidence of exposure to canine coronavirus by means of an indirect fluorescent antibody procedure. Serum antibody prevalence averaged 70% (167/240) during the spring collection period and 25% (46/185) during the autumn collection period. Prevalence was 0% (0/42) in the autumn pup cohort (age 4-5 mo), and 60% (58/97) in the spring pup cohort (age 9-10 mo). Prevalence was lowest in the Eastern Interior study area. A statistical model indicates that prevalence increased slightly each year in all three study areas. These results indicate that transmission occurs primarily during the winter months, antibody decay is quite rapid, and reexposure during the summer is rare.

      Blood samples were collected from seven species of free-ranging ungulates in Alaska. Sera were tested for evidence of exposure to malignant catarrhal fever viruses (MCFV) by means of a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibody prevalences were as follows: muskox (Ovibos moschatus) 100 positive samples of 104 tested (96%); Dall sheep (Ovis dalli) 212 of 222 (95%); elk (Cervus elaphus) 14 of 51 (27%); bison (Bison bison) 34 of 197 (17%); caribou (Rangifer tarandus) nine of 232 (4%); Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) one of 49 (2%); and moose (Alces alces) three of 219 (1%). Antibody prevalence in a bison population from the Interior was stable over a 5 yr period. These results indicate that at least one virus in the MCF group is enzootic in Dall sheep and muskox in Alaska. Lower antibody prevalences in the other species in this survey suggest that MCFV are latent or subclinical in these free-ranging ruminants. Whole blood samples were collected from 14 Dall sheep and subjected to a polymerase chain reaction assay. Fragments of ovine herpesvirus-2 DNA were detected in six of the samples. The significance of these findings for the health of free-ranging ungulates in Alaska is unknown.

      Small mammals were trapped in northeastern Alberta, Canada during 1976. Blood samples from these animals were tested for virus by inoculation of suckling mice. Blood clots from two deer mice yielded isolates of the same virus. The virus was related antigenically to a number of flaviviruses which have been isolated from mammals in Central America and North America and was related most closely to Modoc virus. Physical, chemical, and biological properties of the virus were similar also to those of Modoc virus. It did not produce illness or death in deer mice inoculated in the laboratory. Neutralization tests indicated that 1/38 (3%) red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), 3/35 (9%) least chipmunks (Eutamius minimus), 13/109 (12%) deer mice, and 3/50 (6%) humans were infected naturally. This is the first reported evidence of infection of red squirrels and chipmunks with a Modoc-like virus. These data extend the range of Modoc-like viruses northward by 1,500 km and comprise the first isolate from mammals in the boreal forest of Canada.

      Borna disease virus (BDV) is a non-cytolytic, neurotropic RNA virus that can infect many vertebrate species, including humans. To date, BDV infection has been reported in a range of animal species across a broad global geographic distribution. However, a systematic epidemiological survey of BDV infection in domesticated animals in China has yet to be performed. In current study, BDV RNA and antibodies in 2353 blood samples from apparently healthy animals of eight species (horse, donkey, dog, pig, rabbit, cattle, goat, sheep) from three areas in western China (Xinjiang province, Chongqing municipality, and Ningxia province) were assayed using reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) and ELISA assay. Brain tissue samples from a portion of the BDV RNA- and/or antibody-positive animals were subjected to RT-qPCR and western blotting. As a result, varying prevalence of BDV antibodies and/or RNA was demonstrated in various animal species from three areas, ranging from 4.4 % to 20.0 %. Detection of BDV RNA and/or antibodies in Chongqing pigs (9.2 %) provided the first known evidence of BDV infection in this species. Not all brain tissue samples from animals whose blood was BDV RNA and/or antibody positive contained BDV RNA and protein. This study provides evidence that BDV infection among healthy domestic animal species is more widespread in western China than previously believed.

      The identification and characterization of bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 (BVDV-2) strain SD-06 isolated from cattle in China is reported. We performed sequence analysis of 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) and E2 sequences and the identity at the nucleotide and amino acid level indicated that the isolate was closely related to BVDV-2. The BVDV-2 strain New York'93 showed the highest sequence homology with the isolate SD-06. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate SD-06 belonged to BVDV-2a subtype. Furthermore, immunofluorescence assay with the monoclonal antibody specific for BVDV-2 glycoprotein E2 confirmed this identification. Thus, the strain SD-06 was the first isolate of BVDV-2 identified in China.

      Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is one of the most important of the known viral respiratory pathogens of both young and adult cattle. However BPIV3 has not been detected or isolated in China prior to this study. In 2008, four BPIV3 strains were isolated with MDBK cells from cattle in China and characterized by RT-PCR, nucleotide sequence analysis, transmission electron microscope observation, hemadsorption and hemagglutination tests. Nucleotide phylogenetic analysis of partial hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene for four isolates and the complete genome for the SD0835 isolate implicated that the four Chinese BPIV3 strains were distinct from the previously reported genotype A (BPIV3a) and genotype B (BPIV3b) and might be a potentially new genotype, which was tentatively classified as genotype C (BPIV3c). This is the first study to report the isolation and genetic characterization of BPIV3 from cattle in China.

      The yatapoxvirus genus contains three members: tanapox virus (TPV), yaba-like disease virus (YLDV) and yaba monkey tumor virus (YMTV), two of which (TPV and YLDV) may infect humans. However, only a very small number of patients have been diagnosed with TPV outside Africa. Given the increased international travel and the similarity of clinical signs during the early stages of a TPV/YLDV infection as compared to diseases caused by agents of potential biological warfare, such as smallpox, monkeypox, tularemia and anthrax, the rapid and reliable recognition of a TPV/YLDV infection is crucial. A real-time PCR assay using TaqManchemistry was developed in order to identify unambiguously TPV/YLDV. Primers and probe targeting a 101bp region of the PstI L fragment of TPV, initial optimisations steps were carried out with YLDV DNA as template. Using probit regression analysis, the lower limit of detection was calculated to be ca. 8 copies per assay. A total of five TPV strains, one YDLV strain and scab-derived DNA from a patient with a TPV infection yielded specific amplification, whereas the DNA of YMTV was not amplified. Various viral and bacterial pathogens (n=29) associated with rash-causing illnesses were not detected using this assay.

      Phylogenetic relationships of rabies viruses recovered from black-backed jackals (Canis mesomelas) and domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in northern South Africa were investigated to determine whether the black-backed jackal is an emerging maintenance host species for rabies in this region. A panel of 123 rabies viruses obtained from the two host species between 1980 and 2006 were characterised by nucleotide sequencing of the cytoplasmic domain of the glycoprotein gene and the non-coding G-L intergenic region. Through phylogenetic analysis a viral cluster specific to black-backed jackals and spanning a 5-year period was delineated in western Limpopo. Virus strains associated with domestic dogs prevail in densely populated communal areas in north-eastern Limpopo and in south and eastern Mpumalanga. The data presented in this study indicated the likelihood that black-backed jackals are capable of sustaining rabies cycles independent of domestic dogs. It is proposed that wildlife rabies control strategies, in synergy with domestic animal vaccination should be considered for effective control of rabies in South Africa.
