"Cryptosporidium spp. are protozoan parasites that infect perhaps all vertebrate animals, with a subset of species and genotypes that function as food- and waterborne pathogens. The objective of this work was to collate the Cryptosporidium species and genotypes from common wild rodents on the west coast of the USA and update the information regarding the zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium from these ubiquitous wild species. Representative sequences of the 18S rRNA gene for a unique set of Cryptosporidium isolates obtained from deer mice, house mice, mountain beavers, yellow-bellied marmot, long-tailed vole, California ground squirrels, Belding's ground squirrels, and a golden-mantled ground squirrel in GenBank were selected for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic and BLAST analysis indicated that 4 (18%) of the 22 unique Cryptosporidium sequences from these wild rodent species were 99.75% to 100% identical to known zoonotic species (C. parvum, C. ubiquitum, C. xiaoi), suggesting that a minority of these representative Cryptosporidium isolates could have a public health impact through food and waterborne routes of human exposure. These zoonotic isolates were shed by deer mice and a yellow-bellied marmot from California, and from a mountain beaver trapped in Oregon. In addition, the group of unique Cryptosporidium isolates from deer mice and ground dwelling squirrels exhibited considerable DNA diversity, with multiple isolates appearing to be either host-limited or distributed throughout the various clades within the phylogenetic tree representing the various Cryptosporidium species from host mammals. These results indicate that only a subset of the unique Cryptosporidium genotypes and species obtained from wild rodents on the US west coast are of public health concern; nevertheless, given the geographic ubiquity of many of these host species and often high density at critical locations like municipal watersheds or produce production fields, prudent pest control practices are warranted to minimize the risks of water- and foodborne transmission to humans.

"The order Rodentia comprises more than 2000 species divided into 3 groups based on anatomic and functional differences of the masseter muscle. Myomorph and sciuromorph species have elodont incisors and anelodont cheek teeth, unlike hystrichomorph species which have full anelodont dentition. Diseases of incisors and cheek teeth of rat-like and squirrel-like rodents result in a wide variety of symptoms and clinical signs. Appropriate diagnostic testing and imaging techniques are required to obtain a definitive diagnosis, formulate a prognosis, and develop a treatment plan. A thorough review of elodontoma, odontoma, and pseudo-odontoma is provided, including treatment of pseudo-odontomas in prairie dogs.

"The vomiting (emetic) reflex is documented in numerous mammalian species, including primates and carnivores, yet laboratory rats and mice appear to lack this response. It is unclear whether these rodents do not vomit because of anatomical constraints (e.g., a relatively long abdominal esophagus) or lack of key neural circuits. Moreover, it is unknown whether laboratory rodents are representative of Rodentia with regards to this reflex. Here we conducted behavioral testing of members of all three major groups of Rodentia; mouse-related (rat, mouse, vole, beaver), Ctenohystrica (guinea pig, nutria), and squirrel-related (mountain beaver) species. Prototypical emetic agents, apomorphine (sc), veratrine (sc), and copper sulfate (ig), failed to produce either retching or vomiting in these species (although other behavioral effects, e.g., locomotion, were noted). These rodents also had anatomical constraints, which could limit the efficiency of vomiting should it be attempted, including reduced muscularity of the diaphragm and stomach geometry that is not well structured for moving contents towards the esophagus compared to species that can vomit (cat, ferret, and musk shrew). Lastly, an in situ brainstem preparation was used to make sensitive measures of mouth, esophagus, and shoulder muscular movements, and phrenic nerve activity-key features of emetic episodes. Laboratory mice and rats failed to display any of the common coordinated actions of these indices after typical emetic stimulation (resiniferatoxin and vagal afferent stimulation) compared to musk shrews. Overall the results suggest that the inability to vomit is a general property of Rodentia and that an absent brainstem neurological component is the most likely cause. The implications of these findings for the utility of rodents as models in the area of emesis research are discussed.

"The role of missense changes in BRCA1 in breast cancer susceptibility has been difficult to establish. We used comparative evolutionary methods to identify potential functionally important amino acid sites in exon 11 and missense changes likely to disrupt gene function, aligning sequences from 57 eutherian mammals and categorizing amino acid sites by degree of conservation. We used Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to determine relationships among orthologs and identify codons evolving under positive selection. Most conserved residues occur in a region with the highest concentration of protein-interacting domains. Rapidly evolving residues are concentrated in the RAD51-interacting domain, suggesting that selection is acting most strongly on the role of BRCA1 in DNA repair. Investigation of the functional role of missense changes in breast-cancer susceptibility should focus on 38 missense changes in conserved and 3 in rapidly evolving regions of exon 11.

"The high polymorphism of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes is generally considered to be a result of pathogen-mediated balancing selection. Such selection may operate in the form of heterozygote advantage, and/or through specific MHC allele-pathogen interactions. Specific MHC allele-pathogen interactions may promote polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), or selection that varies in time and/or space because of variability in the composition of the pathogen community (fluctuating selection; FS). In addition, divergent allele advantage (DAA) may act on top of these forms of balancing selection, explaining the high sequence divergence between MHC alleles. DAA has primarily been thought of as an extension of heterozygote advantage. However, DAA could also work in concert with NFDS though this is yet to be tested explicitly. To evaluate the importance of DAA in pathogen-mediated balancing selection, we surveyed allelic polymorphism of MHC class II DQB genes in wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and tested for associations between DQB haplotypes and infection by Borrelia afzelii, a tick-transmitted bacterium causing Lyme disease in humans. We found two significant associations between DQB haplotypes and infection status: one haplotype was associated with lower risk of infection (resistance), while another was associated with higher risk of infection (susceptibility). Interestingly, allelic divergence within individuals was higher for voles with the resistance haplotype compared to other voles. In contrast, allelic divergence was lower for voles with the susceptibility haplotype than other voles. The pattern of higher allelic divergence in individuals with the resistance haplotype is consistent with NFDS favouring divergent alleles in a natural population, hence selection where DAA works in concert with NFDS.

"Ten strains, BG-AF3-A(T), pH52_RY, WF-MT5-A(T), BG-MG3-A, Lr3000(T), RRLNB_1_1, STM3_1(T), STM2_1, WF-MO7-1(T) and WF-MA3-C, were isolated from intestinal or faecal samples of rodents, pheasant and primate. 16S rRNA gene analysis identified them as Limosilactobacillus reuteri. However, average nucleotide identity and digital DNA-DNA hybridization values based on whole genomes were below 95 and 70 %, respectively, and thus below the threshold levels for bacterial species delineation. Based on genomic, chemotaxonomic and morphological analyses, we propose five novel species with the names Limosilactobacillus balticus sp. nov. (type strain BG-AF3-A(T)=DSM 110574(T)=LMG 31633(T)), Limosilactobacillus agrestis sp. nov. (type strain WF-MT5-A(T)=DSM 110569(T)=LMG 31629(T)), Limosilactobacillus albertensis sp. nov. (type strain Lr3000(T)=DSM 110573(T)=LMG 31632(T)), Limosilactobacillus rudii sp. nov. (type strain STM3_1(T)=DSM 110572(T)=LMG 31631(T)) and Limosilactobacillus fastidiosus sp. nov. (type strain WF-MO7-1(T)=DSM 110576(T)=LMG 31630(T)). Core genome phylogeny and experimental evidence of host adaptation of strains of L. reuteri further provide a strong rationale to consider a number of distinct lineages within this species as subspecies. Here we propose six subspecies of L. reuteri: L. reuteri subsp. kinnaridis subsp. nov. (type strain AP3(T)=DSM 110703(T)=LMG 31724(T)), L. reuteri subsp. porcinus subsp. nov. (type strain 3c6(T)=DSM 110571(T)=LMG 31635(T)), L. reuteri subsp. murium subsp. nov. (type strain lpuph1(T)=DSM 110570(T)=LMG 31634(T)), L. reuteri subsp. reuteri subsp. nov. (type strain F 275(T)=DSM 20016(T)=ATCC 23272(T)), L. reuteri subsp. suis subsp. nov. (type strain 1063(T)=ATCC 53608(T)=LMG 31752(T)) and L. reuteri subsp. rodentium subsp. nov. (type strain 100-23(T)=DSM 17509(T)=CIP 109821(T)).

"Quantifying hair cortisol has become popular in wildlife ecology for its practical advantages for evaluating stress. Before hair cortisol levels can be reliably interpreted, however, it is key to first understand the intrinsic factors explaining intra- and inter-specific variation. Bats are an ecologically diverse group of mammals that allow studying such variation. Given that many bat species are threatened or have declining populations in parts of their range, minimally invasive tools for monitoring colony health and identifying cryptic stressors are needed to efficiently direct conservation efforts. Here we describe intra- and inter-specific sources of variation in hair cortisol levels in 18 Neotropical bat species from Belize and Mexico. We found that fecundity is an important ecological trait explaining inter-specific variation in bat hair cortisol. Other ecological variables such as colony size, roost durability and basal metabolic rate did not explain hair cortisol variation among species. At the individual level, females exhibited higher hair cortisol levels than males and the effect of body mass varied among species. Overall, our findings help validate and accurately apply hair cortisol as a monitoring tool in free-ranging bats.

"Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular Apicomplexan parasite with a broad range of intermediate hosts, including humans and rodents. Rodents are considered to be reservoirs of infection for their predators, including cats, felids, pigs, and wild boars. We conducted a multi-site, long-term study on T. gondii in northeastern Poland. The study aimed to monitor the seroprevalence of T. gondii in the four abundant vole species found in the region (Myodes glareolus, Microtus arvalis, Microtus agrestis, and Alexandromys oeconomus) and to assess the influence of both extrinsic (year of study and study site) and intrinsic (host sex and host age) factors on seroprevalence. A bespoke enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect antibodies against T. gondii. We examined 577 rodent individuals and detected T. gondii antibodies in the sera of all four rodent species with an overall seroprevalence of 5.5% [4.2-7.3] (3.6% [2.6-4.9] for M. glareolus and 20% [12-30.9] for M. arvalis, M. agrestis, and A. oeconomus). Seroprevalence in bank voles varied significantly between host age and sex. Seroprevalence increased with host age and was higher in females than males. These results contribute to our understanding of the distribution and abundance of T. gondii in voles in Poland and confirm that T. gondii also circulates in M. glareolus and M. arvalis, M. agrestis and A. oeconomus. Therefore, they may potentially play a role as reservoirs of this parasite in the sylvatic environment.

"BACKGROUND: During the last decades a northward and upward range shift has been observed among many organisms across different taxa. In the northern hemisphere, ticks have been observed to have increased their latitudinal and altitudinal range limit. However, the elevational expansion at its northern distribution range remains largely unstudied. In this study we investigated the altitudinal distribution of the exophilic Ixodes ricinus and endophilic I. trianguliceps on two mountain slopes in Norway by assessing larval infestation rates on bank voles (Myodes glareolus). METHODS: During 2017 and 2018, 1325 bank voles were captured during the spring, summer and autumn at ten trapping stations ranging from 100 m to 1000 m.a.s.l. in two study areas in southern Norway. We used generalized logistic regression models to estimate the prevalence of infestation of both tick species along gradients of altitude, considering study area, collection year and season, temperature, humidity and altitude interactions as extrinsic variables, and host body mass and sex as intrinsic predictor variables. RESULTS: We found that both I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps infested bank voles at altitudes up to 1000 m.a.s.l., which is a substantial increase in altitude compared to previous findings for I. ricinus in this region. The infestation rates declined more rapidly with increasing altitude for I. ricinus compared to I. trianguliceps, indicating that the endophilic ecology of I. trianguliceps may provide shelter from limiting factors tied to altitude. Seasonal effects limited the occurrence of I. ricinus during autumn, but I. trianguliceps was found to infest rodents at all altitudes during all seasons of both years. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides new insights into the altitudinal distribution of two tick species at their northern distribution range, one with the potential to transmit zoonotic pathogens to both humans and livestock. With warming temperatures predicted to increase, and especially so in the northern regions, the risk of tick-borne infections is likely to become a concern at increasingly higher altitudes in the future.

"Most small rodent populations in the world have fascinating population dynamics. In the northern hemisphere, voles and lemmings tend to show population cycles with regular fluctuations in numbers. In the southern hemisphere, small rodents tend to have large amplitude outbreaks with less regular intervals. In the light of vast research and debate over almost a century, we here discuss the driving forces of these different rodent population dynamics. We highlight ten questions directly related to the various characteristics of relevant populations and ecosystems that still need to be answered. This overview is not intended as a complete list of questions but rather focuses on the most important issues that are essential for understanding the generality of small rodent population dynamics.

"During recent years, China has become a hotspot for the domestication of mandarin fish, and this is of great commercial value. Although the food preference of domesticated mandarin fish has been studied, little is known about genes regulating their growth. We raised hybrid mandarin fish on artificial feed for 3 months, the results showed that the survival rate of hybrid mandarin fish was 60.00%. Their total length and body weight were 18.34 ±0.43 cm and 100.44 ±4.87 g. The absolute length and weight gain rates were 0.14 cm/d and 1.08 g/d, respectively. Finally, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to identify potential genes and pathways activated in response to growth performance. The transcriptome analysis generated 68, 197 transcripts and 45,871 unigenes. Among them, 1025 genes were up-regulated and 593 genes were down-regulated between the fast- and slow-growth fish. Finally, we obtained 32 differentially expressed genes, which were mainly related to fatty acid biosynthesis (e.g. FASN and ACACB), collecting duct acid secretion (e.g. ATP6E and KCC4), cell cycle (e.g. CDC20 and CCNB), and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system (IGFBP1). These pathways might be related to the growth of hybrid mandarin fish. In addition, more potential single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in the fast-growth fish than in the slow-growth fish. The results suggest that the interaction of metabolism and abundant alleles might determine the growth of hybrid mandarin fish after food conversion.

"Scarcely investigated in terms of small mammals, kitchen gardens and homesteads form a subset of environments. Using results of snap trapping, we present the first data on small mammal species diversity, gender and age structure, relative abundance, body fitness, and reproduction parameters in these commensal habitats (kitchen gardens, homestead gardens, houses, and outbuildings). We expected that (i) house mice should be the dominant species in buildings, while striped field mice should be dominant in gardens, (ii) body condition should be the highest in buildings, (iii) body condition should increase in the autumn, irrespective of the habitat, and (iv) breeding failures in the form of disrupted pregnancies should be observed. Not all of the predictions were confirmed. From the seven recorded species, gardens and outbuildings were dominated by yellow-necked mice, while bank voles dominated in buildings where food was available. The number of recorded species and diversity index increased during the autumn months. The body condition was highest in rodents that were trapped in gardens. It decreased towards winter, with the exception of the striped field mouse. Breeding disturbances were recorded in all of the most numerous species, comprising 16.7-100% of all observed pregnancies.

"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-based mating rules can evolve as a way to avoid inbreeding or to increase offspring immune competence. While the role of mating preference in shaping the MHC diversity in vertebrates has been acknowledged, its impact on individual MHC diversity has not been considered. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate how simple mating rules favouring MHC-dissimilar partners affect the evolution of the number of MHC variants in individual genomes, accompanying selection for resistance to parasites. We showed that the effect of such preferences could sometimes be dramatic. If preferences are aimed at avoiding identical alleles, the equilibrium number of MHC alleles is much smaller than under random mating. However, if the mating rule minimizes the ratio of shared to different alleles in partners, MHC number is higher than under random mating. Additionally, our simulations revealed that a negative correlation between the numbers of MHC variants in mated individuals can arise from simple rules of MHC-disassortative mating. Our results reveal unexpected potential of MHC-based mating preferences to drive MHC gene family expansions or contractions and highlight the need to study the mechanistic basis of such preferences, which is currently poorly understood.

"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is an important arbovirus, which is found across large parts of Eurasia and is considered to be a major health risk for humans. Like any other arbovirus, TBEV relies on complex interactions between vectors, reservoir hosts, and the environment for successful virus circulation. Hard ticks are the vectors for TBEV, transmitting the virus to a variety of animals. The importance of these animals in the lifecycle of TBEV is still up for debate. Large woodland animals seem to have a positive influence on virus circulation by providing a food source for adult ticks; birds are suspected to play a role in virus distribution. Bank voles and yellow-necked mice are often referred to as classical virus reservoirs, but this statement lacks strong evidence supporting their highlighted role. Other small mammals (e.g., insectivores) may also play a crucial role in virus transmission, not to mention the absence of any suspected reservoir host for non-European endemic regions. Theories highlighting the importance of the co-feeding transmission route go as far as naming ticks themselves as the true reservoir for TBEV, and mammalian hosts as a mere bridge for transmission. A deeper insight into the virus reservoir could lead to a better understanding of the development of endemic regions. The spatial distribution of TBEV is constricted to certain areas, forming natural foci that can be restricted to sizes of merely 500 square meters. The limiting factors for their occurrence are largely unknown, but a possible influence of reservoir hosts on the distribution pattern of TBE is discussed. This review aims to give an overview of the multiple factors influencing the TBEV transmission cycle, focusing on the role of virus reservoirs, and highlights the questions that are waiting to be further explored.

"In recent years, it has become evident that a generational gap has developed in the community of arbovirus research. This apparent gap is due to the dis-investment of training for the next generation of arbovirologists, which threatens to derail the rich history of virus discovery, field epidemiology, and understanding of the richness of diversity that surrounds us. On the other hand, new technologies have resulted in an explosion of virus discovery that is constantly redefining the virosphere and the evolutionary relationships between viruses. This paradox presents new challenges that may have immediate and disastrous consequences for public health when yet to be discovered arboviruses emerge. In this review we endeavor to bridge this gap by providing a historical context for the work being conducted today and provide continuity between the generations. To this end, we will provide a narrative of the thrill of scientific discovery and excitement and the challenges lying ahead.

"MHC genes, which code for proteins responsible for presenting pathogen-derived antigens to the host immune system, show remarkable copy-number variation both between and within species. However, the evolutionary forces driving this variation are poorly understood. Here, we use computer simulations to investigate whether evolution of the number of MHC variants in the genome can be shaped by the number of pathogen species the host population encounters (pathogen richness). Our model assumed that while increasing a range of pathogens recognised, expressing additional MHC variants also incurs costs such as an increased risk of autoimmunity. We found that pathogen richness selected for high MHC copy number only when the costs were low. Furthermore, the shape of the association was modified by the rate of pathogen evolution, with faster pathogen mutation rates selecting for increased host MHC copy number, but only when pathogen richness was low to moderate. Thus, taking into account factors other than pathogen richness may help explain wide variation between vertebrate species in the number of MHC genes. Within population, variation in the number of unique MHC variants carried by individuals (INV) was observed under most parameter combinations, except at low pathogen richness. This variance gave rise to positive correlations between INV and host immunocompetence (proportion of pathogens recognised). However, within-population variation in host immunocompetence declined with pathogen richness. Thus, counterintuitively, pathogens can contribute more to genetic variance for host fitness in species exposed to fewer pathogen species, with consequences to predictions from ""Hamilton-Zuk"" theory of sexual selection.

"We analysed a fragment (247 bp) of cytochrome b of mitochondrial DNA sequenced using 353 samples of yellow-necked mice Apodemus flavicollis trapped in seven forests and along three woodlot transects in north-eastern Poland. Our aims were to identify the phylogeographic pattern and mtDNA structure of the population and to evaluate the role of environmental conditions in shaping the spatial pattern of mtDNA diversity. We found out that three European haplogroups occurred sympatrically in north-eastern Poland. Inferences based on mtDNA haplotype distribution and frequency defined five subpopulations. The mtDNA-based structure of mice significantly correlated with winter temperature: frequency of Haplogroup 1 was positively, and that of Haplogroup 3 negatively correlated to mean temperature of January in the year of trapping. Synthesis of the published pan-European data on the species phylogeography also showed that the possibly 'thermophilous' Haplogroup 1 has the westernmost occurrence, whereas the more 'cold-resistant' Haplogroup 3 occurs much further to north-east than the other haplogroups. The observed patter may be a byproduct of the tight coevolution with nuclear genes, as we have earlier found that - in mice population in NE Poland - the spatial pattern of nuclear DNA was best explained by January temperature. Alternatively, the observed association of mitochondrial genetic variation with temperature is possible to be adaptive as cytochrome b is involved in the process of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation.

"Xin Dai, Ling-Yu Zhou, Jie-Xia Cao, Yan-Qi Zhang, Feng-Ping Yang, Ai-Qin Wang, Wan-Hong Wei, and Sheng-Mei Yang (2018) Population density is well known to influence animal physiology and behavior. How population density affects the aggressive behavior of the Brandt's vole (Lasiopodomys brandtii) is, however, little known. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of group density on physiologic responses and aggressive behavior of male Brandt's voles and their potential underlying neuro-mechanism. The results show that increasing group density led to elevated serum corticosterone levels and increased spleen weight; it also induced more male-male aggressive behavior. By contrast, it had a negative effect on body growth and the weight of testis and epididymis. Aging also increased male-male aggressive behavior. Higher density reduced mRNA levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5HT1A), and 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5HT1B) in the amygdala and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Our results demonstrate that higher population density can intensify stress reactions and male-male aggressive behavior in Brandt's voles at the price of inhibiting body growth and reproduction. Serotonergic systems in the amygdala and the DRN may take part in the control of aggressive behavior among male voles. Our results provide novel insights into the neuro-mechanism underlying the influence of population density on aggressive behavior in Brandt's vole, and imply that aggressive behavior may play an important role in the population fluctuation of the animal.

"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne diseases pose a major threat in public health. The epidemiological dynamics of these diseases depends on the tick vector species and their hosts, as well as the geographical distribution and ecology of both. Among many possible hosts for ticks, small mammals have a major role in the development of immature stages of several tick species. Small mammals are also important reservoir hosts for several pathogenic agents and possible reservoirs for Anaplasma phagocytophilum. In this context, the aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in small mammal species in Romania. RESULTS: A total of 791 small mammals of 31 species were tested by PCR, targeting the rrs gene for detection of A. phagocytophilum DNA. Positive results were obtained in 20 small mammals: five Apodemus flavicollis (6.49%), three Sorex araneus (9.09%), three A. uralensis (4.84%), two A. sylvaticus (3.92%), and one of each Spermophilus cittelus (7.14%), Microtus agrestis (3.85%), Sorex minutus (3.85%), Muscardinus avellanarius (3.13%), Crocidura suaveolens (2.44%), Mus spicilegus (2%) and M. arvalis (1.75%). CONCLUSIONS: Eleven small mammal species were found to be carriers of A. phagocytophilum, suggesting a possible involvement of these species in its epidemiology. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. phagocytophilum in S. minutus, C. suaveolens, M. spicilegus, M. avellanarius and S. citellus.

"BACKGROUND: A well-functioning immune defence is crucial for fitness, but our knowledge about the immune system and its complex interactions is still limited. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are involved in T-cell mediated adaptive immune responses, but MHC is also highly upregulated during the initial innate immune response. The aim of our study was therefore to determine to what extent the highly polymorphic MHC is involved in interactions of the innate and adaptive immune defence and if specific functional MHC alleles (FA) or heterozygosity at the MHC are more important. METHODS: To do this we used captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to survey MHC diversity and immune function controlling for several environmental factors. MHC class I alleles were identified using parallel amplicon sequencing and to mirror immune function, several immunological tests that correspond to the innate and adaptive immunity were conducted. RESULTS: Our results reveal that MHC was linked to all immune tests, highlighting its importance for the immune defence. While all innate responses were associated with one single FA, adaptive responses (cell-mediated and humoral) were associated with several different alleles. DISCUSSION: We found that repeated injections of an antibody in nestlings and adults were linked to different FA and hence might affect different areas of the immune system. Also, individuals with a higher number of different FA produced a smaller secondary response, indicating a disadvantage of having numerous MHC alleles. These results demonstrate the complexity of the immune system in relation to the MHC and lay the foundation for other studies to further investigate this topic.

"BACKGROUND: Vertical transmission is one of the transmission routes for Babesia microti, the causative agent of the zoonotic disease, babesiosis. Congenital Babesia invasions have been recorded in laboratory mice, dogs and humans. The aim of our study was to determine if vertical transmission of B. microti occurs in naturally-infected reservoir hosts of the genus Microtus. METHODS: We sampled 124 common voles, Microtus arvalis; 76 root voles, M. oeconomus and 17 field voles, M. agrestis. In total, 113 embryos were isolated from 20 pregnant females. Another 11 pregnant females were kept in the animal house at the field station in Urwitałt until they had given birth and weaned their pups (n = 62). Blood smears and/or PCR targeting the 550 bp 18S rRNA gene fragment were used for the detection of B. microti. Selected PCR products, including isolates from females/dams and their embryos/pups, were sequenced. RESULTS: Positive PCR reactions were obtained for 41% (89/217) of the wild-caught voles. The highest prevalence of B. microti was recorded in M. arvalis (56/124; 45.2%), then in M. oeconomus (30/76; 39.5%) and the lowest in M. agrestis (3/17; 17.7%). Babesia microti DNA was detected in 61.4% (27/44) of pregnant females. Vertical transmission was confirmed in 81% (61/75) of the embryos recovered from Babesia-positive wild-caught pregnant females. The DNA of B. microti was detected in the hearts, lungs and livers of embryos from 98% of M. arvalis, 46% of M. oeconomus and 0% of M. agrestis embryos from Babesia-positive females. Of the pups born in captivity, 90% were born to Babesia-positive dams. Babesia microti DNA was detected in 70% (35/50) of M. arvalis and 83% (5/6) of M. oeconomus pups. Congenitally acquired infections had no impact on the survival of pups over a 3-week period post partum. Among 97 B. microti sequences, two genotypes were found. The IRU1 genotype (Jena-like) was dominant in wild-caught voles (49/53; 92%), pregnant females (9/11; 82%) and dams (3/5; 60%). The IRU2 genotype (Munich-like) was dominant among B. microti positive embryos (20/27; 74%) and pups (12/17; 71%). CONCLUSION: A high rate of vertical transmission of the two main rodent genotypes of B. microti was confirmed in two species of naturally infected voles, M. arvalis and M. oeconomus.

"Tick-borne diseases are considered as emerging infectious diseases in humans and animals in China. In this study, Ixodes persulcatus (n = 1699), Haemaphysalis concinna (n = 412), Haemaphysalis longicornis (n = 390), Dermacentor nuttalli (n = 253), and Dermacentor silvarum (n = 204) ticks were collected by flagging from northeastern China, and detected for infection with Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Babesia, and Hepatozoon spp. by using nested polymerase chain reaction assays and sequencing analysis. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected in all tick species, i.e., I. persulcatus (9.4%), H. longicornis (1.9%), H. concinna (6.5%), D. nuttalli (1.7%), and D. silvarum (2.3%); Anaplasma bovis was detected in H. longicornis (0.3%) and H. concinna (0.2%); Ehrlichia muris was detected in I. persulcatus (2.5%) and H. concinna (0.2%); Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis was only detected in I. persulcatus (0.4%). The Ehrlichia variant (GenBank access number KU921424), closely related to Ehrlichia ewingii, was found in H. longicornis (0.8%) and H. concinna (0.2%). I. persulcatus was infected with Babesia venatorum (1.2%), Babesia microti (0.6%), and Babesia divergens (0.6%). Additionally, four Babesia sequence variants (GenBank access numbers 862303-862306) were detected in I. persulcatus, H. longicornis, and H. concinna, which belonged to the clusters formed by the parasites of dogs, sheep, and cattle (B. gibsoni, B. motasi, and B. crassa). Two Hepatozoon spp. (GenBank access numbers KX016028 and KX016029) associated with hepatozoonosis in Japanese martens were found in the collected ticks (0.1-3.1%). These findings showed the genetic variability of Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Babesia, and Hepatozoon spp. circulating in ticks in northeastern China, highlighting the necessity for further research of these tick-associated pathogens and their role in human and animal diseases.

"Silicon has generally not been considered essential for plant growth, although it is well recognized that many plants, particularly Poaceae, have substantial plant tissue concentrations of this element. Recently, however, the International Plant Nutrition Institute [IPNI] (2015), Georgia, USA has listed it as a ""beneficial substance"". This reflects that numerous studies have now established that silicon may alleviate both biotic and abiotic stress. This paper explores the existing knowledge and recent advances in elucidating the role of silicon in plant defense against biotic stress, particularly against arthropod pests in agriculture and attraction of beneficial insects. Silicon confers resistance to herbivores via two described mechanisms: physical and biochemical/molecular. Until recently, studies have mainly centered on two trophic levels; the herbivore and plant. However, several studies now describe tri-trophic effects involving silicon that operate by attracting predators or parasitoids to plants under herbivore attack. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that silicon-treated, arthropod-attacked plants display increased attractiveness to natural enemies, an effect that was reflected in elevated biological control in the field. The reported relationships between soluble silicon and the jasmonic acid (JA) defense pathway, and JA and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) suggest that soluble silicon may enhance the production of HIPVs. Further, it is feasible that silicon uptake may affect protein expression (or modify proteins structurally) so that they can produce additional, or modify, the HIPV profile of plants. Ultimately, understanding silicon under plant ecological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular contexts will assist in fully elucidating the mechanisms behind silicon and plant response to biotic stress at both the bi- and tri-trophic levels.

"Dermacentor reticulatus is a hard tick species with extraordinary biological features. It has a high reproduction rate, a rapid developmental cycle, and is also able to overcome years of unfavourable conditions. Dermacentor reticulatus can survive under water for several months and is cold-hardy even compared to other tick species. It has a wide host range: over 60 different wild and domesticated hosts are known for the three active developmental stages. Its high adaptiveness gives an edge to this tick species as shown by new data on the emergence and establishment of D. reticulatus populations throughout Europe. The tick has been the research focus of a growing number of scientists, physicians and veterinarians. Within the Web of Science database, more than a fifth of the over 700 items published on this species between 1897 and 2015 appeared in the last three years (2013-2015). Here we attempt to synthesize current knowledge on the systematics, ecology, geographical distribution and recent spread of the species and to highlight the great spectrum of possible veterinary and public health threats it poses. Canine babesiosis caused by Babesia canis is a severe leading canine vector-borne disease in many endemic areas. Although less frequently than Ixodes ricinus, D. reticulatus adults bite humans and transmit several Rickettsia spp., Omsk haemorrhagic fever virus or Tick-borne encephalitis virus. We have not solely collected and reviewed the latest and fundamental scientific papers available in primary databases but also widened our scope to books, theses, conference papers and specialists colleagues' experience where needed. Besides the dominant literature available in English, we also tried to access scientific literature in German, Russian and eastern European languages as well. We hope to inspire future research projects that are necessary to understand the basic life-cycle and ecology of this vector in order to understand and prevent disease threats. We conclude that although great strides have been made in our knowledge of the eco-epidemiology of this species, several gaps still need to be filled with basic research, targeting possible reservoir and vector roles and the key factors resulting in the observed geographical spread of D. reticulatus.

"BACKGROUND: Long-term field studies of parasite communities are rare but provide a powerful insight into the ecological processes shaping host-parasite interactions. The aim of our study was to monitor long-term trends in the haemoparasite communities of spiny mice (Acomys dimidiatus) and to identify the principal factors responsible for changes over a 12 year period. METHODS: To this end we sampled four semi-isolated populations of mice (n = 835) in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 in four dry montane valleys (wadis) located in the Sinai Massif, Egypt. RESULTS: Overall 76.2 % of spiny mice carried at least one of the five haemoparasite genera (Babesia, Bartonella, Haemobartonella, Hepatozoon, Trypanosoma) recorded in the study. Prevalence of haemoparasites varied significantly between the sites with the highest overall prevalence in Wadi Tlah and the lowest in W. El Arbaein, and this changed significantly with time. In the first two surveys there was little change in prevalence, but by 2008, when the first signs of a deepening drought in the region had become apparent, prevalence began to drift downwards, and by 2012 prevalence had fallen to the lowest values recorded from all four sites over the entire 12-year period. The overall mean species richness was 1.2 ± 0.03, which peaked in 2004 and then dropped by more than 50 % by 2012. Species richness was highest among mice from Wadi Tlah and peaked in age class 2 mice (young adults). Site was the most significant factor affecting the prevalence of individual parasite species, with Trypanosoma acomys and Hepatozoon sp. occurring mainly in two wadis (W. Tlah & W. Gharaba). In four of the five genera recorded in the study we observed a significant drop in prevalence or/and abundance since 2004, the exception being Hepatozoon sp. CONCLUSIONS: During the 12-year-long period of study in the Sinai, we observed dynamic changes and possibly even cycles of prevalence and abundance of infections which differed depending on parasite species. Although the exact reasons cannot be identified at this time, we hypothesize that the effects of a 15-year-long scarcity of rainfall in the local environment and a fall in host densities over the period of study may have been responsible for a drop in transmission rates, possibly by a negative impact on vector survival.

"The SAG2 vaccine (RABIGEN® SAG2) is a modified live attenuated rabies virus vaccine, selected from the SAD Bern strain in a two-step process of amino acid mutation using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. The strain is genetically stable and does not spread in vivo or induce a persistent infection. Its absence of residual pathogenicity was extensively demonstrated in multiple target and non target species (such as wild carnivores and rodent species), including non-human primates. The efficacy of SAG2 baits was demonstrated according to the EU requirements for the red fox and raccoon dog. The use of safe and potent rabies vaccines such as SAG2 largely contributed to the elimination of rabies in Estonia, France, Italy and Switzerland. Importantly, these countries were declared free of rabies after few years of oral vaccination campaigns with SAG2 baits distributed with an appropriate strategy. The excellent tolerance of the SAG2 vaccine has been confirmed in the field since its first use in 1993. No safety issues have been reported, and in particular no vaccine-induced rabies cases were diagnosed, after the distribution of more than 20 million SAG2 baits in Europe.

"Leptospirosis is an acute, febrile disease occurring in humans and animals worldwide. Leptospira spp. are usually transmitted through direct or indirect contact with the urine of infected reservoir animals. Among wildlife species, rodents act as the most important reservoir for both human and animal infection. To gain a better understanding of the occurrence and distribution of pathogenic leptospires in rodent and shrew populations in Germany, kidney specimens of 2973 animals from 11 of the 16 federal states were examined by PCR. Rodent species captured included five murine species (family Muridae), six vole species (family Cricetidae) and six shrew species (family Soricidae). The most abundantly trapped animals were representatives of the rodent species Apodemus flavicollis, Clethrionomys glareolus and Microtus agrestis. Leptospiral DNA was amplified in 10% of all animals originating from eight of the 11 federal states. The highest carrier rate was found in Microtus spp. (13%), followed by Apodemus spp. (11%) and Clethrionomys spp. (6%). The most common Leptospira genomospecies determined by duplex PCR was L. kirschneri, followed by L. interrogans and L. borgpetersenii; all identified by single locus sequence typing (SLST). Representatives of the shrew species were also carriers of Leptospira spp. In 20% of Crocidura spp. and 6% of the Sorex spp. leptospiral DNA was detected. Here, only the pathogenic genomospecies L. kirschneri was identified.

"Pathogen evasion of the host immune system is a key force driving extreme polymorphism in genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Although this gene family is well characterized in structure and function, there is still much debate surrounding the mechanisms by which MHC diversity is selectively maintained. Many studies have investigated relationships between MHC variation and specific pathogens, and have found mixed support for and against the hypotheses of heterozygote advantage, frequency-dependent or fluctuating selection. Few, however, have focused on the selective effects of multiple parasite types on host immunogenetic patterns. Here, we examined relationships between variation in the equine MHC gene, ELA-DRA, and both gastrointestinal (GI) and ectoparasitism in plains zebras (Equus quagga). Specific alleles present at opposing population frequencies had antagonistic effects, with rare alleles associated with increased GI parasitism and common alleles with increased tick burdens. These results support a frequency-dependent mechanism, but are also consistent with fluctuating selection. Maladaptive GI parasite 'susceptibility alleles' were reduced in frequency, suggesting that these parasites may play a greater selective role at this locus. Heterozygote advantage, in terms of allele mutational divergence, also predicted decreased GI parasite burden in genotypes with a common allele. We conclude that an immunogenetic trade-off affects resistance/susceptibility to parasites in this system. Because GI and ectoparasites do not directly interact within hosts, our results uniquely show that antagonistic parasite interactions can be indirectly modulated through the host immune system. This study highlights the importance of investigating the role of multiple parasites in shaping patterns of host immunogenetic variation.

"Dispersal, the tendency for organisms to reproduce away from their parents, influences many evolutionary and ecological processes, from speciation and extinction events, to the coexistence of genotypes within species or biological invasions. Understanding how dispersal evolves is crucial to predict how global changes might affect species persistence and geographical distribution. The factors driving the evolution of dispersal have been well characterized from a theoretical standpoint, and predictions have been made about their respective influence on, for example, dispersal polymorphism or the emergence of dispersal syndromes. However, the experimental tests of some theories remain scarce partly because a synthetic view of theoretical advances is still lacking. Here, we review the different ingredients of models of dispersal evolution, from selective pressures and types of predictions, through mathematical and ecological assumptions, to the methods used to obtain predictions. We provide perspectives as to which predictions are easiest to test, how theories could be better exploited to provide testable predictions, what theoretical developments are needed to tackle this topic, and we place the question of the evolution of dispersal within the larger interdisciplinary framework of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

"Long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) can have beneficial effects against fat deposition, cardiovascular diseases, and liver steatosis. We investigated how diets based on lard (predominantly saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids) or flaxseed oil (rich in 18:3n-3) affect liver fat-% and fatty acid profiles of tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus). We also studied potential participation of hyaluronan (HA) in the pathology of fatty liver and whether the development and recovery of fasting-induced steatosis are influenced by n-3 PUFA. The dietary fatty acid composition was manifested in the liver fatty acid signatures. Fasting for 18 h induced macrovesicular steatosis and the liver fat-% increased to 22% independent of the preceding diet. Fasting-induced steatosis did not involve inflammation or connective tissue activation indicated by the absence of both leukocyte accumulation and increased HA. Food deprivation modified the liver fatty acid signatures to resemble more closely the diets. Fasting reduced the proportions of long-chain n-3 PUFA in both dietary regimes and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios in the lard-fed voles. Decreases in long-chain n-3 PUFA may promote lipid accumulation by modulating the expression of lipid-metabolizing genes. Dietary 18:3n-3 did not prevent the development or attenuate the manifestation of steatosis in the fasted voles or promote the recovery.

"The bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum has for decades been known to cause the disease tick-borne fever (TBF) in domestic ruminants in Ixodes ricinus-infested areas in northern Europe. In recent years, the bacterium has been found associated with Ixodes-tick species more or less worldwide on the northern hemisphere. A. phagocytophilum has a broad host range and may cause severe disease in several mammalian species, including humans. However, the clinical symptoms vary from subclinical to fatal conditions, and considerable underreporting of clinical incidents is suspected in both human and veterinary medicine. Several variants of A. phagocytophilum have been genetically characterized. Identification and stratification into phylogenetic subfamilies has been based on cell culturing, experimental infections, PCR, and sequencing techniques. However, few genome sequences have been completed so far, thus observations on biological, ecological, and pathological differences between genotypes of the bacterium, have yet to be elucidated by molecular and experimental infection studies. The natural transmission cycles of various A. phagocytophilum variants, the involvement of their respective hosts and vectors involved, in particular the zoonotic potential, have to be unraveled. A. phagocytophilum is able to persist between seasons of tick activity in several mammalian species and movement of hosts and infected ticks on migrating animals or birds may spread the bacterium. In the present review, we focus on the ecology and epidemiology of A. phagocytophilum, especially the role of wildlife in contribution to the spread and sustainability of the infection in domestic livestock and humans.

"BACKGROUND: Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exhibit high levels of variability, which is believed to have arisen through pathogen-mediated selection. We investigated the relationship between parasite load and genetic diversity at selectively neutral, non-coding markers (microsatellites) and adaptive genetic variation at a functionally important part of the MHC in six independent natural populations of Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) from two regions of the Xilingol Grassland area of Inner Mongolia. RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty-two voles were screened for gastrointestinal parasites, and were assessed for genetic variation. Parasite screening was done through non-invasive fecal egg counts, while allelic diversity was determined via single-stranded conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing. We detected eight distinct helminth egg morphotypes. A total of 10 microsatellite loci were genotyped and 19 unique MHC class II B alleles were isolated. The rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) exceeded the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS) at putative antigen binding sites of DRB. Neutral and adaptive genetic diversity differed between the six vole populations. To test the main pathogen-driven selection hypotheses for the maintenance of host MHC diversity and parasite species-specific co-evolutionary effects, multivariate approaches (generalized linear mixed models) were used to test for associations between the MHC class II DRB genotype and infections with nematodes. We found no evidence for heterozygote advantage, and overall heterozygosity was lower than expected in the MHC alleles. We identified an association between the parasite load and specific MHC alleles in the voles, and this pattern varied between geographic regions. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that MHC variability in Brandt's voles is maintained by rare allele advantage and fluctuating selection, but the data failed to show any heterozygote advantage effect. Our results add to a growing body of evidence showing that the mode and relative strength of pathogen-driven selection acting on MHC diversity varies within specific wild populations. In addition, our study contributes to the understanding of what maintains MHC diversity, of host-pathogen coevolution and of how genetic diversity is maintained in voles.

"Genetic variation at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is vitally important for wildlife populations to respond to pathogen threats. As natural populations can fluctuate greatly in size, a key issue concerns how population cycles and bottlenecks that could reduce genetic diversity will influence MHC genes. Using 454 sequencing, we characterized genetic diversity at the DRB Class II locus in montane voles (Microtus montanus), a North American rodent that regularly undergoes high-amplitude fluctuations in population size. We tested for evidence of historic balancing selection, recombination, and gene duplication to identify mechanisms maintaining allelic diversity. Counter to our expectations, we found strong evidence of purifying selection acting on the DRB locus in montane voles. We speculate that the interplay between population fluctuations and gene duplication might be responsible for the weak evidence of historic balancing selection and strong evidence of purifying selection detected. To further explore this idea, we conducted a phylogenetically controlled comparative analysis across 16 rodent species with varying demographic histories and MHC duplication events (based on the maximum number of alleles detected per individual). On the basis of phylogenetic generalized linear model-averaging, we found evidence that the estimated number of duplicated loci was positively related to allelic diversity and, surprisingly, to the strength of purifying selection at the DRB locus. Our analyses also revealed that species that had undergone population bottlenecks had lower allelic richness than stable species. This study highlights the need to consider demographic history and genetic structure alongside patterns of natural selection to understand resulting patterns of genetic variation at the MHC.

"Tularemia is a serious, potentially life threatening zoonotic disease. The causative agent, Francisella tularensis, is ubiquitous in the Northern hemisphere, including Alaska, where it was first isolated from a rabbit tick (Haemophysalis leporis-palustris) in 1938. Since then, F. tularensis has been isolated from wildlife and humans throughout the state. Serologic surveys have found measurable antibodies with prevalence ranging from < 1% to 50% and 4% to 18% for selected populations of wildlife species and humans, respectively. We reviewed and summarized known literature on tularemia surveillance in Alaska and summarized the epidemiological information on human cases reported to public health officials. Additionally, available F. tularensis isolates from Alaska were analyzed using canonical SNPs and a multi-locus variable-number tandem repeats (VNTR) analysis (MLVA) system. The results show that both F. t. tularensis and F. t. holarctica are present in Alaska and that subtype A.I, the most virulent type, is responsible for most recently reported human clinical cases in the state.

"Recent studies have highlighted both the positive and negative impacts of species invasions. Most of these studies have been conducted on either immobile invasive plants or sessile fauna found at the base of food webs. Fewer studies have examined the impacts of vagile invasive consumers on native competitors. This is an issue of some importance given the controlling influence that consumers have on lower order plants and animals. Here, we present results of laboratory experiments designed to assess the impacts of unintended aquaculture releases of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), in estuaries of the Gulf of Mexico, on the functionally similar redspotted sunfish (Lepomis miniatus). Laboratory choice tests showed that tilapia prefer the same structured habitat that native sunfish prefer. In subsequent interspecific competition experiments, agonistic tilapia displaced sunfish from their preferred structured habitats. When a piscivore (largemouth bass) was present in the tank with both species, the survival of sunfish decreased. Based on these findings, if left unchecked, we predict that the proliferation of tilapia (and perhaps other aggressive aquaculture fishes) will have important detrimental effects on the structure of native food webs in shallow, structured coastal habitats. While it is likely that the impacts of higher trophic level invasive competitors will vary among species, these results show that consequences of unintended releases of invasive higher order consumers can be important.

"Ghrelin is a 28-amino-acid peptide that displays a strong growth hormone- (GH-) releasing activity through the activation of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). The first studies about role of ghrelin were focused on its orexigenic ability, but despite indisputable pharmacological data, the evidence for a physiological role for ghrelin in the control of appetite is much less clear. Mice with targeted deletion of either ghrelin or the GHSR exhibit an essentially normal metabolic phenotype when fed a regular chow diet, suggesting that ghrelin may have a redundant role in the regulation of food intake. RNAs for ghrelin as well as GHSR are expressed in the pancreas of rats and humans and several studies propose that ghrelin could have an important function in glucose homeostasis and insulin release, independent of GH secretion. Low plasma ghrelin levels are associated with elevated fasting insulin levels and insulin resistance, suggesting both physiological and pathophysiological roles for ghrelin. For this reason, at least theoretically, ghrelin and/or its signalling manipulation could be useful for the treatment or prevention of diseases of glucose homeostasis such as type 2 diabetes.

"One probable cost of dispersing to a new breeding habitat is unfamiliarity with local conditions such as the whereabouts of food or the habits of local predators, and consequently immigrants may have lower probabilities of survival than more experienced residents. Within a breeding season, estimated daily survival probabilities of cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) at colonies in southwestern Nebraska were highest for birds that had always nested at the same site, followed by those for birds that had nested there in some (but not all) past years. Daily survival probabilities were lowest for birds that were naïve immigrants to a colony site and for yearling birds that were nesting for the first time. Birds with past experience at a colony site had monthly survival 8.6% greater than that of naïve immigrants. All colonies where experienced residents did better than immigrants were smaller than 750 nests in size, and in colonies greater than 750 nests, naïve immigrants paid no survival costs relative to experienced residents. Removal of nest ectoparasites by fumigation resulted in higher survival probabilities for all birds, on average, and diminished the differences between immigrants and past residents, probably by improving bird condition to the extent that effects of past experience were relatively less important and harder to detect. The greater survival of experienced residents could not be explained by condition or territory quality, suggesting that familiarity with a local area confers survival advantages during the breeding season for cliff swallows. Colonial nesting may help to moderate the cost of unfamiliarity with an area, likely through social transfer of information about food sources and enhanced vigilance in large groups.

"Plasma biochemical and hematologic values are important parameters for assessing animal health and experimental results. Although normal reference values for many rodent species have been published, there is a dearth of similar information for the genus Microtus. In addition, most studies use a mean and standard deviation to establish reference intervals, but doing so is not the recommendation of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (formerly the National Committee on Clinical Laboratory Standards) or the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. The purpose of this study was to establish normal reference parameters for plasma biochemistry and hematology in mature pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) by using the nonparametric rank percentile method as recommended by the 2 laboratory medicine organizations mentioned. Samples of cardiac blood from a closed colony of pine voles were collected at euthanasia and evaluated under rodent settings on 2 automated hematology analyzers from 2 different manufacturers and on the same type of automated biochemistry analyzer. There were no sex-associated clinically significant differences between the sexes; younger animals had a lower hematocrit, higher mean corpuscular volume, and lower mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration than did older animals. Only platelet counts differed when comparing hematologic values from different analyzers. Relative to rats and mice, pine voles have a lower mean corpuscular volume and higher red blood cell count, higher blood urea nitrogen, much higher alanine aminotransferase, and lower glucose and phosphorous concentrations. Hematology and plasma biochemical results obtained in this study are considered representative for healthy adult laboratory pine voles under similar environmental conditions.

"Morphological traits can be highly variable over time in a particular geographical area. Different selective pressures shape those traits, which is crucial in evolutionary biology. Among these traits, insect wing morphometry has already been widely used to describe phenotypic variability at the inter-specific level. On the contrary, fewer studies have focused on intra-specific wing morphometric variability. Yet, such investigations are relevant to study potential convergences of variation that could highlight micro-evolutionary processes. The recent sampling and sequencing of three solitary bees of the genus Melitta across their entire species range provides an excellent opportunity to jointly analyse genetic and morphometric variability. In the present study, we first aim to analyse the spatial distribution of the wing shape and centroid size (used as a proxy for body size) variability. Secondly, we aim to test different potential predictors of this variability at both the intra- and inter-population levels, which includes genetic variability, but also geographic locations and distances, elevation, annual mean temperature and precipitation. The comparison of spatial distribution of intra-population morphometric diversity does not reveal any convergent pattern between species, thus undermining the assumption of a potential local and selective adaptation at the population level. Regarding intra-specific wing shape differentiation, our results reveal that some tested predictors, such as geographic and genetic distances, are associated with a significant correlation for some species. However, none of these predictors are systematically identified for the three species as an important factor that could explain the intra-specific morphometric variability. As a conclusion, for the three solitary bee species and at the scale of this study, our results clearly tend to discard the assumption of the existence of a common pattern of intra-specific signal/structure within the intra-specific wing shape and body size variability.

"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented public health, and social and economic challenges. It remains unclear whether seasonal changes in ambient temperature will alter spreading trajectory of the COVID-19 epidemic. The probable mechanism on this is still lacking. This review summarizes the most recent research data on the effect of ambient temperature on the COVID-19 epidemic characteristic. The available data suggest that (i) mesophilic traits of viruses are different due to their molecular composition; (ii) increasing ambient temperature decreases the persistence of some viruses in aquatic media; (iii) a 1°C increase in the average monthly minimum ambient temperatures (AMMAT) was related to a 0.72% fewer mammalian individuals that would be infected by coronavirus; (iv) proportion of zoonotic viruses of mammals including humans is probably related to their body temperature difference; (v) seasonal divergence between the northern and southern hemispheres may be a significant driver in determining a waved trajectory in the next 2 years. Further research is needed to understand its effects and mechanisms of global temperature change so that effective strategies can be adopted to curb its natural effects. This paper mainly explores possible scientific hypothesis and evidences that local communities and authorities should consider to find optimal solutions that can limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus.

"The number of documented American orthohantaviruses has increased significantly over recent decades, but most fundamental research has remained focused on just two of them: Andes virus (ANDV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV). The majority of American orthohantaviruses are known to cause disease in humans, and most of these pathogenic strains were not described prior to human cases, indicating the importance of understanding all members of the virus clade. In this review, we summarize information on the ecology of under-studied rodent-borne American orthohantaviruses to form general conclusions and highlight important gaps in knowledge. Information regarding the presence and genetic diversity of many orthohantaviruses throughout the distributional range of their hosts is minimal and would significantly benefit from virus isolations to indicate a reservoir role. Additionally, few studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying transmission routes and factors affecting the environmental persistence of orthohantaviruses, limiting our understanding of factors driving prevalence fluctuations. As landscapes continue to change, host ranges and human exposure to orthohantaviruses likely will as well. Research on the ecology of neglected orthohantaviruses is necessary for understanding both current and future threats to human health.

"This article reviews the literature on the circadian rhythms of body temperature and whole-organism metabolism. The two rhythms are first described separately, each description preceded by a review of research methods. Both rhythms are generated endogenously but can be affected by exogenous factors. The relationship between the two rhythms is discussed next. In endothermic animals, modulation of metabolic activity can affect body temperature, but the rhythm of body temperature is not a mere side effect of the rhythm of metabolic thermogenesis associated with general activity. The circadian system modulates metabolic heat production to generate the body temperature rhythm, which challenges homeothermy but does not abolish it. Individual cells do not regulate their own temperature, but the relationship between circadian rhythms and metabolism at the cellular level is also discussed. Metabolism is both an output of and an input to the circadian clock, meaning that circadian rhythmicity and metabolism are intertwined in the cell.

"Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of Chagas disease, usually transmitted by triatomine vectors. An estimated 20 to 30% of infected individuals develop potentially lethal cardiac or gastrointestinal disease. Sylvatic transmission cycles exist in the southern United States, involving 11 triatomine vector species and infected mammals such as rodents, opossums, and dogs. Nevertheless, imported chronic T. cruzi infections in migrants from Latin America vastly outnumber locally acquired human cases. Benznidazole is now FDA approved, and clinical and public health efforts are under way by researchers and health departments in a number of states. Making progress will require efforts to improve awareness among providers and patients, data on diagnostic test performance and expanded availability of confirmatory testing, and evidence-based strategies to improve access to appropriate management of Chagas disease in the United States.

"Multiple species of viruses circulate in wild mammals, some of them potentially causing zoonosis. Most of the suspected viral zoonotic diseases affecting human patients remain unidentified with regard to their aetiological agent. The aim of this study is to summarize the state of knowledge of the viral richness associated with wild mammals in Mexico throughout 1900-2018 and their relationship with human cases. We compiled two databases, one of them containing all available published studies on potentially zoonotic viruses in wild mammals and another with human cases related to zoonotic viruses. The database on wild mammals covers the period of 1900-2018; the human case database spans 2000-2013. We calculated the richness of viral potential zoonotic agents and evaluated their geographical distribution. We found 262 records of 42 potential zoonotic viral species associated with 92 wild mammal species in 28 states across Mexico. Records of human viral cases were only found in 29 states, which did not overlap with the reports in wild mammals. We detected 25.6% (42/164) of viral zoonotic agents reported worldwide. This analysis opens a relevant topic of discussion for public health attention.

"Arboviruses are often maintained in complex cycles involving vertebrates such as mammals or birds and blood-feeding mosquitoes. However, the role of wildlife hosts in their emergence or re-emergence in human populations has received little attention. The recent emergence of Zika virus in America, and previous occurrences of chikungunya and dengue, forces us to confront a potential new disease-emergence phenomenon. Using a spatial data mining framework to identify potential biotic interactions, based on the degree of co-occurrence between different species, we identified those mammal species with the highest potential for establishing mammal-vector interactions, considering as principal vector Aedes aegypti. Seven of the top ten identified mammal species with highest potential were bats, with two of them having previously been confirmed as positive hosts for dengue in Mexico. We hope that this will raise interest of Mexican public health authorities and academic institutions to assess the role of wild hosts in the maintenance and spread of arboviruses.

"Zoonoses are an important class of infectious diseases. An important element determining the impact of a zoonosis on domestic animal and human health is host range. Although for particular zoonoses some host species have been identified, until recently there have been no methods to predict those species most likely to be hosts or their relative importance. Complex inference networks infer potential biotic interactions between species using their degree of geographic co-occurrence, and have been posited as a potential tool for predicting disease hosts. Here we present the results of an interdisciplinary, empirical study to validate a model based on such networks for predicting hosts of Leishmania (L.) mexicana in Mexico. Using systematic sampling to validate the model predictions we identified 22 new species of host (34% of all species collected) with the probability to be a host strongly dependent on the probability of co-occurrence of vector and host. The results confirm that Leishmania (L.) mexicana is a generalist parasite but with a much wider host range than was previously thought. These results substantially change the geographic risk profile for Leishmaniasis and provide insights for the design of more efficient surveillance measures and a better understanding of potential dispersal scenarios.

"Invasive species may impact pathogen transmission by altering the distributions and interactions among native vertebrate reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors. Here, we examined the direct and indirect effects of the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) on the native tick, small mammal and pathogen community in southeast Texas. Using a replicated large-scale field manipulation study, we show that small mammals were more abundant on treatment plots where S. invicta populations were experimentally reduced. Our analysis of ticks on small mammal hosts demonstrated a threefold increase in the ticks caught per unit effort on treatment relative to control plots, and elevated tick loads (a 27-fold increase) on one common rodent species. We detected only one known human pathogen (Rickettsia parkeri), present in 1.4% of larvae and 6.7% of nymph on-host Amblyomma maculatum samples but with no significant difference between treatment and control plots. Given that host and vector population dynamics are key drivers of pathogen transmission, the reduced small mammal and tick abundance associated with S. invicta may alter pathogen transmission dynamics over broader spatial scales.

"The evolutionary relationships between Peromyscus, Habromys, Isthmomys, Megadontomys, Neotomodon, Osgoodomys, and Podomys are poorly understood. In order to further explore the evolutionary boundaries of Peromyscus and compare potential taxonomic solutions for this diverse group and its relatives, we conducted phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1-I2), beta fibrinogen (Fgb-I7), interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (Rbp3), and cytochrome-b (Cytb). Phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes produced similar topologies although levels of nodal support varied. The best-supported topology was obtained by combining nuclear and mitochondrial sequences. No monophyletic Peromyscus clade was supported. Instead, support was found for a clade containing Habromys, Megadontomys, Neotomodon, Osgoodomys, Podomys, and Peromyscus suggesting paraphyly of Peromyscus and confirming previous observations. Our analyses indicated an early divergence of Isthmomys from Peromyscus (approximately 8 million years ago), whereas most other peromyscine taxa emerged within the last 6 million years. To recover a monophyletic taxonomy from Peromyscus and affiliated lineages, we detail 3 taxonomic options in which Habromys, Megadontomys, Neotomodon, Osgoodomys, and Podomys are retained as genera, subsumed as subgenera, or subsumed as species groups within Peromyscus. Each option presents distinct taxonomic challenges, and the appropriate taxonomy must reflect the substantial levels of morphological divergence that characterize this group while maintaining the monophyletic relationships obtained from genetic data.

"Many birds and mammals drastically reduce their energy expenditure during times of cold exposure, food shortage, or drought, by temporarily abandoning euthermia, i.e. the maintenance of high body temperatures. Traditionally, two different types of heterothermy, i.e. hypometabolic states associated with low body temperature (torpor), have been distinguished: daily torpor, which lasts less than 24 h and is accompanied by continued foraging, versus hibernation, with torpor bouts lasting consecutive days to several weeks in animals that usually do not forage but rely on energy stores, either food caches or body energy reserves. This classification of torpor types has been challenged, suggesting that these phenotypes may merely represent extremes in a continuum of traits. Here, we investigate whether variables of torpor in 214 species (43 birds and 171 mammals) form a continuum or a bimodal distribution. We use Gaussian-mixture cluster analysis as well as phylogenetically informed regressions to quantitatively assess the distinction between hibernation and daily torpor and to evaluate the impact of body mass and geographical distribution of species on torpor traits. Cluster analysis clearly confirmed the classical distinction between daily torpor and hibernation. Overall, heterothermic endotherms tend to be small; hibernators are significantly heavier than daily heterotherms and also are distributed at higher average latitudes (∼35°) than daily heterotherms (∼25°). Variables of torpor for an average 30 g heterotherm differed significantly between daily heterotherms and hibernators. Average maximum torpor bout duration was >30-fold longer, and mean torpor bout duration >25-fold longer in hibernators. Mean minimum body temperature differed by ∼13°C, and the mean minimum torpor metabolic rate was ∼35% of the basal metabolic rate (BMR) in daily heterotherms but only 6% of BMR in hibernators. Consequently, our analysis strongly supports the view that hibernators and daily heterotherms are functionally distinct groups that probably have been subject to disruptive selection. Arguably, the primary physiological difference between daily torpor and hibernation, which leads to a variety of derived further distinct characteristics, is the temporal control of entry into and arousal from torpor, which is governed by the circadian clock in daily heterotherms, but apparently not in hibernators.

"Hantaan virus was discovered in Korea during the 1970s while other similar viruses were later reported in Asia and Europe. There was no information about hantavirus human infection in the Americas until 1993 when an outbreak was described in the United States. This event promoted new studies to find hantaviruses in the Americas. At first, many studies were conducted in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay, while other Latin American countries began to report the presence of these agents towards the end of the 20th century. More than 30 hantaviruses have been reported in the Western Hemisphere with more frequent cases registered in the southern cone (Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil). However there was an important outbreak in 2000 in Panama and some rare events have been described in Peru, Venezuela and French Guiana. Since hantaviruses have only recently emerged as a potential threat in the tropical zones of the Americas, this review compiles recent hantavirus reports in Central America, the Caribbean islands and the northern region of South America. These studies have generated the discovery of new hantaviruses and could help to anticipate the presentation of possible future outbreaks in the region.

"Rodent species are routinely presented to veterinary hospitals for wellness checks and different illnesses. When rodents are presented to the veterinarian for diagnosis and treatment, they deserve the same thorough approach that any other domestic species receives. The purpose of this article is to provide readers a review of the current information regarding examination, diagnosis, and treatment of some of the most common conditions for which rodent patients are presented. This article will cover 5 of the most common rodent species presented to veterinarians: guinea pigs, chinchillas, rats, mice, and hamsters.
"
"This chapter focuses on mice and rats, and provides detailed information that may be useful for veterinarians treating these animals. Mice are continuous, polyestrous rodents that should be bred in polygamous or monogamous setups because of the males' aggressive territoriality behavior. When breeding mice that have been housed in a polygamous ratio, there may be one male with two to six females. Females are removed from a polygamous cage before parturition, whereas the monogamous pair is maintained together with the young until weaning. Mice are maintained in environments that are similar to other small rodents but require a thorough cleaning of their cage more often because of their malodorous urine. Ventilation is essential for small rodent housing to prevent irritation of the respiratory tract from ammonia vapors generated by urine. Quarantining is important when a new animal is being introduced into a setting in which there is an established group. As with other animals, a 30-day quarantine period is recommended, along with a physical examination and fecal parasite check. To maintain oversight of breeding animals' health and reduce the exposure of young animals to infectious disease and parasites, routine screening of representative animals within the colony is recommended. In very large colonies, special caging, food, and water may be necessary to prevent exposure to disease organisms.

"One hundred DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene of 44 species of deer mice (Peromyscus (sensu stricto), 1 of Habromys, 1 of Isthmomys, 2 of Megadontomys, and the monotypic genera Neotomodon, Osgoodomys, and Podomys were used to develop a molecular phylogeny for Peromyscus. Phylogenetic analyses (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference) were conducted to evaluate alternative hypotheses concerning taxonomic arrangements (sensu stricto versus sensu lato) of the genus. In all analyses, monophyletic clades were obtained that corresponded to species groups proposed by previous authors; however, relationships among species groups generally were poorly resolved. The concept of the genus Peromyscus based on molecular data differed significantly from the most current taxonomic arrangement. Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian trees depicted strong support for a clade placing Habromys, Megadontomys, Neotomodon, Osgoodomys, and Podomys within Peromyscus. If Habromys, Megadontomys, Neotomodon, Osgoodomys, and Podomys are regarded as genera, then several species groups within Peromyscus (sensu stricto) should be elevated to generic rank. Isthmomys was associated with the genus Reithrodontomys; in turn this clade was sister to Baiomys, indicating a distant relationship of Isthmomys to Peromyscus. A formal taxonomic revision awaits synthesis of additional sequence data from nuclear markers together with inclusion of available allozymic and karyotypic data.

"The United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases lists four RNA viral families as the prime etiologic agents for viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF): (1) the Arenaviridae (Argentine, Bolivian, Brazilian, and Venezuelan 10.1016/j.idc.2006.02.001hemorrhagic fevers; and Lassa fever); (2) the Bunyaviridae (Hantavirus genus, Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) from the Nairovirus genus, and Rift Valley fever virus from the Phlebovirus genus) [1]; (3) the Filoviridae (Ebola and Marburg viruses); and (4) Flaviviridae (dengue and yellow fever) [2]. References 3 through 13 list the most important characteristics and classify the Arenaviridae viruses, Bunyaviridae viruses, Filoviridae viruses, and Flaviviridae viruses, respectively."
"Leishmaniasis are neglected diseases caused by several species of Leishmania that affect humans and many domestic and wild animals with a worldwide distribution. The objectives of this review are to identify wild animals naturally infected with zoonotic Leishmania species as well as the organs infected, methods employed for detection and percentage of infection. A literature search starting from 1990 was performed following the PRISMA methodology and 161 reports were included. One hundred and eighty-nine species from ten orders (i.e., Carnivora, Chiroptera, Cingulata, Didelphimorphia, Diprotodontia, Lagomorpha, Eulipotyphla, Pilosa, Primates and Rodentia) were reported to be infected, and a few animals were classified only at the genus level. An exhaustive list of species; diagnostic techniques, including PCR targets; infected organs; number of animals explored and percentage of positives are presented. L. infantum infection was described in 98 wild species and L. (Viania) spp. in 52 wild animals, while L. mexicana, L. amazonensis, L. major and L. tropica were described in fewer than 32 animals each. During the last decade, intense research revealed new hosts within Chiroptera and Lagomorpha. Carnivores and rodents were the most relevant hosts for L. infantum and L. (Viannia) spp., with some species showing lesions, although in most of the studies clinical signs were not reported.

"The equine encephalitis viruses, Venezuelan (VEEV), East (EEEV) and West (WEEV), belong to the genus alphavirus, family Togaviridae and still represent a threat for human and animal public health in the Americas. In both, these infections are characterized by high viremia, rash, fever, encephalitis and death. VEEV encephalitis is similar, clinically, to other arboviral diseases, such as dengue, Zika or chikungunya. Most of the alphaviruses are transmitted between vertebrates and mosquitoes. They are able to replicate in a wide number of hosts, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibian and arthropods. The VEEV has enzootic and epizootic transmission cycles. At the enzootic one, enzootic strains (subtype I, serotypes D-F and serotypes II-VI) are continuously circulating between mosquitoes and wild rodents in tropical forests and mangroves of the Americas. The main reseroivrs are wild rodent species of the subfamily Sigmodontinae. However, bats can be also accidental reservoirs of VEEV. In this article, we reviewed the main features, epidemiology, clinical aspects and the current perspectives of the VEEV.

"Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) has been assessed according to the criteria of the Animal Health Law (AHL), in particular criteria of Article 7 on disease profile and impacts, Article 5 on the eligibility of VEE to be listed, Article 9 for the categorisation of VEE according to disease prevention and control rules as in Annex IV and Article 8 on the list of animal species related to VEE. The assessment has been performed following a methodology composed of information collection and compilation, expert judgement on each criterion at individual and, if no consensus was reached before, also at collective level. The output is composed of the categorical answer, and for the questions where no consensus was reached, the different supporting views are reported. Details on the methodology used for this assessment are explained in a separate opinion. According to the assessment performed, it is inconclusive whether VEE is eligible to be listed for Union intervention as laid down in Article 5(3) of the AHL because there was no full consensus on the criterion 5 A(v). Consequently, since it is inconclusive whether VEE can be considered eligible to be listed for Union intervention as laid down in Article 5(3) of the AHL, the assessment on compliance of VEE with the criteria as in Sections 4 and 5 of Annex IV to the AHL, for the application of the disease prevention and control rules referred to in points (d) and (e) of Article 9(1), and which animal species can be considered to be listed for VEE according to Article 8(3) of the AHL is also inconclusive.

"Peptides with transmitter-like characteristics are being found in many brain areas. The application of immunocytochemical and radioimmunoassay methods has contributed much to the clarification of these neuronal systems. Here we report the development of a rat monoclonal antibody produced by a hybrid myeloma and its application to the study of one of these peptides, substance P. The hybrid clone, isolated after fusion of mouse myeloma cells with hyperimmune rat spleen cells, allowed us to obtain a standardized and permanent source of monoclonal substance P antibodies in a culture cell system. This antibody recognizes the COOH-terminal part of substance P in radioimmunoassay down to 10-20 fmol. It does not crossreact with other known mammalian brain peptides tested. By immunofluorescence the antibody was shown to bind specifically and with a remarkably low background to nerve terminals and cell bodies located in clearly defined nuclear organizations of the central nervous system.

"Cancer is a prevalent cause of mortality around the world. Aberrated activation of Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway promotes tumorigenesis. Natural agents, including phytochemicals, exhibit potent anticancer activities via various mechanisms. However, the therapeutic potency of phytoconstituents as inhibitors of JAK/STAT signaling against cancer has only come into focus in recent days. The current review highlights phytochemicals that can suppress the JAK/STAT pathway in order to impede cancer cell growth. Various databases, such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, SpringerLink, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched using relevant keywords. Once the authors were in agreement regarding the suitability of a study, a full-length form of the relevant article was obtained, and the information was gathered and cited. All the complete articles that were incorporated after the literature collection rejection criteria were applied were perused in-depth and material was extracted based on the importance, relevance, and advancement of the apprehending of the JAK/STAT pathway and their relation to phytochemicals. Based on the critical and comprehensive analysis of literature presented in this review, phytochemicals from diverse plant origins exert therapeutic and cancer preventive effects, at least in part, through regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Nevertheless, more preclinical and clinical research is necessary to completely comprehend the capability of modulating JAK/STAT signaling to achieve efficient cancer control and treatment.

"Indigofera tinctoria and Scoparia dulcis are being widely used in Indian folk medicine for the treatment of various disorders. Environmental noise pollution is thought to be an important factor for many health problems and it causes immune abnormalities. In the present study immune-regulating potential of I. tinctoria and S. dulcis aqueous extracts on innate and adaptive immune system of wistar albino rats was evaluated during normal and chronic noise induced stress conditions. The results demonstrated that both I. tinctoria and S. dulcis aqueous extracts (200 mg/kg b.w) showed immunostimulant effect on both innate and adaptive immune response of wistar albino rat compared to control group under normal condition. The noise stress (100 dB for 1 h, 20 days) induced animals showed suppressive effects on immune response by decreasing macrophage phagocytosis, antibody secretion by spleen cells, humoral immune response, proliferation of lymphocytes, cytotoxicity, TNF α expression, granzyme B and perforin expression in splenic NK cells. Similarly, noise stress also caused DNA damage in tissues. However, the suppressed effects induced by noise stress on rat immune system were significantly prevented by oral administration of both I. tinctoria and S. dulcis aqueous extracts. Considering all these results it is suggested that the selected medicinal plant's aqueous extracts have the potential to prevent the effects of noise stress induced rat immune system and explore a strong immunostimulant potential applicable to clinical practices.

"BACKGROUND: Some observations and reports show that people with high consumption of Solanum aethiopicum (African garden egg) have relief in arthritic pains and swelling. We aimed at assessing the effect of methanol extract of Solanum aethiopicum in experimentally induced inflammation using leukocyte mobilization and vascular permeability tests in rats and human red blood cell (HRBC) membrane stabilization as studies. METHODS: Twenty five (25) adult Wistar rats of either sex (120 g - 200 g) divided into five groups of five rats each were used for each of the animal models. Groups 2, 3 and 4 were administered varied doses of the extract (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), while groups 1 (vehicle control) and 5 (treatment control) received normal saline and indomethacin (50 mg/kg) respectively. Vascular permeability was induced by the intra-peritoneal injection of 1 ml of acetic acid and monitored using 0.5 ml intravenous injection of 1% Evans blue solution. Leukocyte mobilization was induced by the intra-peritoneal injection of 0.5 ml of 3% agar suspension in normal saline. Heat and hypotonicity induced heamolysis of HRBC membrane was used to assess membrane stabilization. RESULTS: The methanol extracts of garden egg significantly and dose dependently reduced (p≤0.05) the acetic acid induced vascular permeability and agar induced leukocyte mobilization in rats. The percentage inhibitions of induced vascular permeability were 21 ± 3.39, 25 ±1.92 and 60 ± 3.81 for the 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of the extract while the inhibitions of the agar induced leucocyte migration were 23 ± 2.17, 26 ± 1.58 and 32 ± 1.58 for the 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg of the extract respectively. The extract also, at doses of 100, 200, 400, 600 and 800 μg/ml significantly inhibited heat induced lysis of the human red cell membrane with values of 66.46 ± 2.89, 65.14 ± 4.58, 46.53 ± 2.52, 61.88 ± 4.51and 86.67 ± 3.06 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that methanol extract of Solanum aethiopicum has anti-inflammatory properties and can reduce inflammatory injury and tissue damage.

"In semi-arid environments, aperiodic rainfall pulses determine plant production and resource availability for higher trophic levels, creating strong bottom-up regulation. The influence of climatic factors on population vital rates often shapes the dynamics of small mammal populations in such resource-restricted environments. Using a 21-year biannual capture-recapture dataset (1993 to 2014), we examined the impacts of climatic factors on the population dynamics of the brush mouse (Peromyscus boylii) in semi-arid oak woodland of coastal-central California. We applied Pradel's temporal symmetry model to estimate capture probability (p), apparent survival (φ), recruitment (f), and realized population growth rate (λ) of the brush mouse and examined the effects of temperature, rainfall, and El Niño on these demographic parameters. The population was stable during the study period with a monthly realized population growth rate of 0.993 ± SE 0.032, but growth varied over time from 0.680 ± 0.054 to 1.450 ± 0.083. Monthly survival estimates averaged 0.789 ± 0.005 and monthly recruitment estimates averaged 0.175 ± 0.038. Survival probability and realized population growth rate were positively correlated with rainfall and negatively correlated with temperature. In contrast, recruitment was negatively correlated with rainfall and positively correlated with temperature. Brush mice maintained their population through multiple coping strategies, with high recruitment during warmer and drier periods and higher survival during cooler and wetter conditions. Although climatic change in coastal-central California will likely favor recruitment over survival, varying strategies may serve as a mechanism by which brush mice maintain resilience in the face of climate change. Our results indicate that rainfall and temperature are both important drivers of brush mouse population dynamics and will play a significant role in predicting the future viability of brush mice under a changing climate.

"Land-use change has a direct impact on species survival and reproduction, altering their spatio-temporal distributions. It acts as a selective force that favours the abundance and diversity of reservoir hosts and affects host-pathogen dynamics and prevalence. This has led to land-use change being a significant driver of infectious diseases emergence. Here, we predict the presence of rodent taxa and map the zoonotic hazard (potential sources of harm) from rodent-borne diseases in the short and long term (2025 and 2050). The study considers three different land-use scenarios based on the shared socioeconomic pathways narratives (SSPs): sustainable (SSP1-Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6), fossil-fuelled development (SSP5-RCP 8.5) and deepening inequality (SSP4-RCP 6.0). We found that cropland expansion into forest and pasture may increase zoonotic hazards in areas with high rodent-species diversity. Nevertheless, a future sustainable scenario may not always reduce hazards. All scenarios presented high heterogeneity in zoonotic hazard, with high-income countries having the lowest hazard range. The SSPs narratives suggest that opening borders and reducing cropland expansion are critical to mitigate current and future zoonotic hazards globally, particularly in middle- and low-income economies. Our study advances previous efforts to anticipate the emergence of zoonotic diseases by integrating past, present and future information to guide surveillance and mitigation of zoonotic hazards at the regional and local scale. This article is part of the theme issue 'Infectious disease macroecology: parasite diversity and dynamics across the globe'.

"The microbiome shapes many host traits, yet the biology of microbiomes challenges traditional evolutionary models. Here, we illustrate how integrating the microbiome into quantitative genetics can help untangle complexities of host-microbiome evolution. We describe two general ways in which the microbiome may affect host evolutionary potential: by shifting the mean host phenotype and by changing the variance in host phenotype in the population. We synthesize the literature across diverse taxa and discuss how these scenarios could shape the host response to selection. We conclude by outlining key avenues of research to improve our understanding of the complex interplay between hosts and microbiomes.

"Wildlife rehabilitation is a publicly popular practice, though not without controversy. State wildlife agencies frequently debate the ecological impact of rehabilitation. By analyzing case records, we can clarify and quantify the causes for rehabilitation, species involved, and treatment outcomes. This data would aid regulatory agencies and rehabilitators in making informed decisions, as well as gaining insight into causes of species mortality. In New York State, the Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) has licensed rehabilitators since 1980 and annual reporting is required. In this study, we analyzed 58,185 individual wildlife cases that were attended by New York rehabilitators between 2012 and 2014. These encompassed 30,182 (51.9%) birds, 25,447 (43.7%) mammals, 2,421 (4.2%) reptiles, and 75 (0.1%) amphibians. We identified patterns among taxonomic representation, reasons for presentation to a rehabilitation center, and animal disposition. Major causes of presentation were trauma (n = 22,156; 38.1%) and orphaning (n = 21,679; 37.3%), with habitat loss (n = 3,937; 6.8%), infectious disease (n = 1,824; 3.1%), and poisoning or toxin exposure (n = 806; 1.4%) playing lesser roles. The overall release rate for animals receiving care was 50.2% while 45.3% died or were euthanized during the rehabilitation process. A relatively small number (0.3%) were permanently non-releasable and placed in captivity; 4.1% had unknown outcomes. A comparable evaluation in 1989 revealed that wildlife submissions have increased (annual mean 12,583 vs 19,395), and are accompanied by a significant improvement in release (50.2% in the study period vs 44.4% in 1989) (χ2(1) = 90.43, p < 0.0001). In this manuscript, we aim to describe the rehabilitator community in New York State, and present the causes and outcomes for rehabilitation over a three-year period.

"Here, we introduce a novel 'evolution of protein domains' (EvoProDom) model for describing the evolution of proteins based on the 'mix and merge' of protein domains. We assembled and integrated genomic and proteomic data comprising protein domain content and orthologous proteins from 109 organisms. In EvoProDom, we characterized evolutionary events, particularly, translocations, as reciprocal exchanges of protein domains between orthologous proteins in different organisms. We showed that protein domains that translocate with highly frequency are generated by transcripts enriched in trans-splicing events, that is, the generation of novel transcripts from the fusion of two distinct genes. In EvoProDom, we describe a general method to collate orthologous protein annotation from KEGG, and protein domain content from protein sequences using tools such as KoFamKOAL and Pfam. To summarize, EvoProDom presents a novel model for protein evolution based on the 'mix and merge' of protein domains rather than DNA-based evolution models. This confers the advantage of considering chromosomal alterations as drivers of protein evolutionary events.

"Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) spirochetes are likely an overlooked cause of disease in Latin America. In Panama, the pathogens were first reported to cause human disease in the early 1900s. Recent collections of Ornithodoros puertoricensis from human dwellings in Panama prompted our interest to determine whether spirochetes still circulate in the country. Ornithodoros puertoricensis ticks were collected at field sites around the City of Panama. In the laboratory, the ticks were determined to be infected with TBRF spirochetes by transmission to mice, and we report the laboratory isolation and genetic characterization of a species of TBRF spirochete from Panama. Since this was the first isolation of a species of TBRF spirochete from Central America, we propose to designate the bacteria as Borrelia puertoricensis sp. nov. This is consistent with TBRF spirochete species nomenclature from North America that are designated after their tick vector. These findings warrant further investigations to assess the threat B. puertoricensis sp. nov. may impose on human health.

"The distribution and availability of microbes in the environment has an important effect on the composition of the gut microbiome of wild vertebrates. However, our current knowledge of gut-environmental interactions is based principally on data from the host bacterial microbiome, rather than on links that establish how and where hosts acquire their gut mycobiome. This complex interaction needs to be clarified. Here, we explored the relationship between the gut fungal communities of Tibetan macaques (Macaca thibetana) and the presence of environmental (plant and soil) fungi at two study sites using the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and next generation sequencing. Our findings demonstrate that the gut, plant and soil fungal communities in their natural habitat were distinct. We found that at both study sites, the core abundant taxa and ASVs (Amplicon Sequence Variants) of Tibetan macaques' gut mycobiome were present in environmental samples (plant, soil or both). However, the majority of these fungi were characterized by a relatively low abundance in the environment. This pattern implies that the ecology of the gut may select for diverse but rare environmental fungi. Moreover, our data indicates that the gut mycobiome of Tibetan macaques was more similar to the mycobiome of their plant diet than that present in the soil. For example, we found three abundant ASVs (Didymella rosea, Cercospora, and Cladosporium) that were present in the gut and on plants, but not in the soil. Our results highlight a relationship between the gut mycobiome of wild primates and environmental fungi, with plants diets possibly contributing more to seeding the macaque's gut mycobiome than soil fungi.

"Laboratory mice have long been an invaluable tool in biomedical science and have made significant contributions in research into life-threatening diseases. However, the translation of research results from mice to humans often proves difficult due to the incomplete nature of laboratory animal-based research. Hence, there is increasing demand for complementary methods or alternatives to laboratory mice that can better mimic human physiological traits and potentially bridge the translational research gap. Under these circumstances, the natural/naturalized mice including ""wild"", ""dirty"", ""wildling"", and ""wilded"" systems have been found to better reflect some aspects of human pathophysiology. Here, we discuss the pros and cons of the laboratory mouse system and contemplate how wild mice and wild microbiota are able to help in refining such systems to better mimic the real-world situation and contribute to more productive translational research.

"AIM: Given that salamanders have experienced large shifts in their distributions over time, we determined how each species of Plethodon in the Pacific Northwest would respond to climate change. We incorporated several greenhouse scenarios both on a species-by-species basis, and also using phylogenetic groups, with the aim to determine the best course of action in managing land area to conserve diversity in this group. LOCATION: Pacific Northwest of the United States (northern CA, OR, WA, ID, and MT). MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Western Plethodon salamanders. METHODS: Species distribution models were estimated using MaxEnt for the current time period and for several future climate scenarios using bioclimatic data layers. We used several methods to quantify the change in habitat suitability over time from the models. We explored aspects of the climate layers to determine whether we can expect a concerted response to climate change due to similarity in ecological niche or independent responses that could be harder to manage. RESULTS: The distribution of western Plethodon salamander species is strongly influenced by precipitation and less so by temperature. Species responses to climate change resulted in both increases and decreases in predicted suitable habitat, though most species ranges do not contract, especially when taken as a phylogenetic group. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: While some established habitats may become more or less climatically suitable, the overall distribution of species in this group is unlikely to be significantly affected. Clades of Plethodon species are unlikely to be in danger of extirpation despite the possibility that individual species may be threatened as a result of limited distributions. Grouping species into lineages with similar geographic ranges can be a viable method of determining conservation needs. More biotic and dispersal information is needed to determine the true impact that changes in climate will have on the distribution of Plethodon species.

"The study of ancient DNA is revolutionizing our understanding of paleo-ecology and the evolutionary history of species. Insects are essential components in many ecosystems and constitute the most diverse group of animals. Yet they are largely neglected in ancient DNA studies. We report the results of the first targeted investigation of insect ancient DNA to positively identify subfossil insects to species, which includes the recovery of endogenous content from samples as old as ~ 34,355 ybp. Potential inhibitors currently limiting widespread research on insect ancient DNA are discussed, including the lack of closely related genomic reference sequences (decreased mapping efficiency) and the need for more extensive collaborations with insect taxonomists. The advantages of insect-based studies are also highlighted, especially in the context of understanding past climate change. In this regard, insect remains from ancient packrat middens are a rich and largely uninvestigated resource for exploring paleo-ecology and species dynamics over time.

"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), appears to be capable of infecting different mammalian species. Recent detections of this virus in pet, zoo, wild, and farm animals have compelled inquiry regarding the zoonotic (animal-to-human) and reverse zoonotic (human-to-animal) transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of COVID-19 pandemic evolving into a panzootic. It is important to monitor the global spread of disease and to assess the significance of genomic changes to support prevention and control efforts during a pandemic. An understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology provides opportunities to prevent the risk of repeated re-infection of humans and requires a robust One Health-based investigation. This review paper describes the known properties and the existing gaps in scientific knowledge about the zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmissibility of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease it causes.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has re-focused attention on mechanisms that lead to zoonotic disease spillover and spread. Commercial wildlife trade, and associated markets, are recognized mechanisms for zoonotic disease emergence, resulting in a growing global conversation around reducing human disease risks from spillover associated with hunting, trade, and consumption of wild animals. These discussions are especially relevant to people who rely on harvesting wildlife to meet nutritional, and cultural needs, including those in Arctic and boreal regions. Global policies around wildlife use and trade can impact food sovereignty and security, especially of Indigenous Peoples. We reviewed known zoonotic pathogens and current risks of transmission from wildlife (including fish) to humans in North American Arctic and boreal biomes, and evaluated the epidemic and pandemic potential of these zoonoses. We discuss future concerns, and consider monitoring and mitigation measures in these changing socio-ecological systems. While multiple zoonotic pathogens circulate in these systems, risks to humans are mostly limited to individual illness or local community outbreaks. These regions are relatively remote, subject to very cold temperatures, have relatively low wildlife, domestic animal, and pathogen diversity, and in many cases low density, including of humans. Hence, favorable conditions for emergence of novel diseases or major amplification of a spillover event are currently not present. The greatest risk to northern communities from pathogens of pandemic potential is via introduction with humans visiting from other areas. However, Arctic and boreal ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes through climate warming, habitat encroachment, and development; all of which can change host and pathogen relationships, thereby affecting the probability of the emergence of new (and re-emergence of old) zoonoses. Indigenous leadership and engagement in disease monitoring, prevention and response, is vital from the outset, and would increase the success of such efforts, as well as ensure the protection of Indigenous rights as outlined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Partnering with northern communities and including Indigenous Knowledge Systems would improve the timeliness, and likelihood, of detecting emerging zoonotic risks, and contextualize risk assessments to the unique human-wildlife relationships present in northern biomes.

"Surveillance of U.S. domestic dogs for exposure to vector-borne pathogens can identify regions of transmission that are relevant for human and animal health. Working dogs with high levels of outdoor exposure may be sensitive indicators of local risk, owing to increased contact with vectors. We randomly selected 476 high-value government working dogs from 40 states to determine the prevalence of infection with Dirofilaria immitis and Rickettsia spp., and exposure to Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Borrelia burgdorferi, and identify risk factors for positivity. Additionally, we tested 100 of these dogs from Texas for Leishmania spp. where sand fly vectors occur. Previously published Trypanosoma cruzi infection data on these dogs were used to identify coinfection or co-exposures. Infection prevalence was 0.84% for D. immitis, and all dogs were negative for Rickettsia spp. DNA. Seroprevalence of each pathogen was: B. burgdorferi 0.84%, Ehrlichia spp. 1.3%, Anaplasma spp. 1.5%, Leishmania spp. 2.0%, and T. cruzi 12.2%. Coinfection or co-exposure took place in four (0.84%) dogs. In bivariable analysis, we found that D. immitis-positive and Ehrlichia-seropositive dogs were significantly older than negative dogs (p < 0.05). Furthermore, seroprevalence of Anaplasma spp. was significantly higher among dogs in the Northeast United States relative to other areas of the country (4.7% vs. ≤1.4%; p = 0.041). Although autochthonous Leishmania infections have been described in the United States, the cases reported herein may represent imported Leishmania infection. Most federal working dogs are bred in Europe, where the parasite is endemic and congenitally transmitted. Serological cross-reaction between T. cruzi and Leishmania spp. complicates diagnosis. In this study, the use of multiple testing strategies in a comparative complementary manner provided evidence for these dogs' true exposures. Comprehensive surveillance for vector-borne pathogens in dogs can improve clinician awareness and target prevention and treatment in a One Health manner.

"The great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus), widely distributed in Asia, is a natural reservoir for Yersinia pestis, Leishmania donovani and some species of helminths. In this study, 188 great gerbils were sampled in Alataw City and Manas County, northwestern China, and tested for the presence of Theileria, Hepatozoon and Taenia species by molecular methods. Theileria sp., named as ""Candidatus Theileria xinjiangensis"", was detected in heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney of 6.9% rodents. Six genotypes of ""Taenia sp. Rhombomys opimus"", which were close to Taenia laticollis (87.3-94.0% identities), were detected in cyst liquid of 5.3% rodents. ""Hepatozoon ayorgbor-like"" haemogregarines was detected in spleens of 1.6% rodents. To our best knowledge, Candidatus Theileria xinjiangensis, Hepatozoon ayorgbor-like and genotypes of ""Taenia sp. Rhombomys opimus"" were found for the first time in the great gerbil. These results extend our knowledge on the diversity and pathogenesis of Theileria, Hepatozoon and Taenia species.

"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 likely emerged from a wildlife source with transmission to humans followed by rapid geographic spread throughout the globe and severe impacts on both human health and the global economy. Since the onset of the pandemic, there have been many instances of human-to-animal transmission involving companion, farmed and zoo animals, and limited evidence for spread into free-living wildlife. The establishment of reservoirs of infection in wild animals would create significant challenges to infection control in humans and could pose a threat to the welfare and conservation status of wildlife. We discuss the potential for exposure, onward transmission and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in an initial selection of wild mammals (bats, canids, felids, mustelids, great apes, rodents and cervids). Dynamic risk assessment and targeted surveillance are important tools for the early detection of infection in wildlife, and here we describe a framework for collating and synthesising emerging information to inform targeted surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife. Surveillance efforts should be integrated with information from public and veterinary health initiatives to provide insights into the potential role of wild mammals in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

"Microbiome is known to play an important role in the health of organisms and different factors such as diet have been associated with modifications in microbial communities. Differences in the microbiota composition of wild and captive animals has been evaluated; however, variation during a reintroduction process in primates has never been reported. Our aim was to identify changes in the bacterial composition of three individuals of reintroduced woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagothricha) and the variables associated with such changes. Fecal samples were collected and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to determine gut microbial composition and functionality. Individual samples from released individuals showed a higher microbial diversity after being released compared to before liberation, associated with changes in their diet. Beta diversity and functionality analysis showed separation of samples from released and captive conditions and the major factor of variation was the moment of liberation. This study shows that intestinal microbiota varies depending on site conditions and is mainly associated with diet diversity. The intake of food from wild origin by released primates may promote a positive effect on gut microbiota, improving health, and potentially increasing success in reintroduction processes.

"Leishmaniasis, a chronic and persistent intracellular protozoal infection caused by many different species within the genus Leishmania, is an unfamiliar disease to most North American providers. Clinical presentations may include asymptomatic and symptomatic visceral leishmaniasis (so-called Kala-azar), as well as cutaneous or mucosal disease. Although cutaneous leishmaniasis (caused by Leishmania mexicana in the United States) is endemic in some southwest states, other causes for concern include reactivation of imported visceral leishmaniasis remotely in time from the initial infection, and the possible long-term complications of chronic inflammation from asymptomatic infection. Climate change, the identification of competent vectors and reservoirs, a highly mobile populace, significant population groups with proven exposure history, HIV, and widespread use of immunosuppressive medications and organ transplant all create the potential for increased frequency of leishmaniasis in the U.S. Together, these factors could contribute to leishmaniasis emerging as a health threat in the U.S., including the possibility of sustained autochthonous spread of newly introduced visceral disease. We summarize recent data examining the epidemiology and major risk factors for acquisition of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, with a special focus on implications for the United States, as well as discuss key emerging issues affecting the management of visceral leishmaniasis.

"Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) instability within genes can induce genetic variation. The SSR signatures remain largely unknown in different clades within Euarchontoglires, one of the most successful mammalian radiations. Here, we conducted a genome-wide characterization of microsatellite distribution patterns at different taxonomic levels in 153 Euarchontoglires genomes. Our results showed that the abundance and density of the SSRs were significantly positively correlated with primate genome size, but no significant relationship with the genome size of rodents was found. Furthermore, a higher level of complexity for perfect SSR (P-SSR) attributes was observed in rodents than in primates. The most frequent type of P-SSR was the mononucleotide P-SSR in the genomes of primates, tree shrews, and colugos, while mononucleotide or dinucleotide motif types were dominant in the genomes of rodents and lagomorphs. Furthermore, (A)n was the most abundant motif in primate genomes, but (A)n, (AC)n, or (AG)n was the most abundant motif in rodent genomes which even varied within the same genus. The GC content and the repeat copy numbers of P-SSRs varied in different species when compared at different taxonomic levels, reflecting underlying differences in SSR mutation processes. Notably, the CDSs containing P-SSRs were categorized by functions and pathways using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes annotations, highlighting their roles in transcription regulation. Generally, this work will aid future studies of the functional roles of the taxonomic features of microsatellites during the evolution of mammals in Euarchontoglires.

"Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases that continue to affect >1 billion people, with these diseases disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations and territories. Climate change is having an increasing impact on public health in tropical and subtropical areas and across the world and can affect disease distribution and transmission in potentially diverse ways. Improving our understanding of how climate change influences NTDs can help identify populations at risk to include in future public health interventions. Articles were identified by searching electronic databases for reports of climate change and NTDs between 1 January 2010 and 1 March 2020. Climate change may influence the emergence and re-emergence of multiple NTDs, particularly those that involve a vector or intermediate host for transmission. Although specific predictions are conflicting depending on the geographic area, the type of NTD and associated vectors and hosts, it is anticipated that multiple NTDs will have changes in their transmission period and geographic range and will likely encroach on regions and populations that have been previously unaffected. There is a need for improved surveillance and monitoring to identify areas of NTD incursion and emergence and include these in future public health interventions.

"Geographic patterns of within-species genomic diversity are shaped by evolutionary processes, life history and historical and contemporary factors. New genomic approaches can be used to infer the influence of such factors on the current distribution of infraspecific lineages. In this study, we evaluated the genomic and morphological diversity as well as the genetic structure of the C(4) grass Panicum hallii across its complex natural distribution in North America. We sampled extensively across the natural range of P. hallii in Mexico and the USA to generate double-digestion restriction-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequence data for 423 individuals from 118 localities. We used these individuals to study the divergence between the two varieties of P. hallii, P. hallii var. filipes and P. hallii var. hallii as well as the genetic diversity and structure within these groups. We also examined the possibility of admixture in the geographically sympatric zone shared by both varieties, and assessed distribution shifts related with past climatic fluctuations. There is strong genetic and morphological divergence between the varieties and consistent genetic structure defining seven genetic clusters that follow major ecoregions across the range. South Texas constitutes a hotspot of genetic diversity with the co-occurrence of all genetic clusters and admixture between the two varieties. It is likely a recolonization and convergence point of populations that previously diverged in isolation during fragmentation events following glaciation periods.

"Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is a tick-borne, zoonosis of adults and children caused by genospecies of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The ailment, widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, continues to increase globally due to multiple environmental factors, coupled with increased incursion of humans into habitats that harbor the spirochete. B. burgdorferi sensu lato is transmitted by ticks from the Ixodes ricinus complex. In North America, B. burgdorferi causes nearly all infections; in Europe, B. afzelii and B. garinii are most associated with human disease. The spirochete's unusual fragmented genome encodes a plethora of differentially expressed outer surface lipoproteins that play a seminal role in the bacterium's ability to sustain itself within its enzootic cycle and cause disease when transmitted to its incidental human host. Tissue damage and symptomatology (i.e., clinical manifestations) result from the inflammatory response elicited by the bacterium and its constituents. The deposition of spirochetes into human dermal tissue generates a local inflammatory response that manifests as erythema migrans (EM), the hallmark skin lesion. If treated appropriately and early, the prognosis is excellent. However, in untreated patients, the disease may present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly involving the central nervous system, joints, or heart. A small percentage (~10%) of patients may go on to develop a poorly defined fibromyalgia-like illness, post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) unresponsive to prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Below we integrate current knowledge regarding the ecologic, epidemiologic, microbiologic, and immunologic facets of Lyme disease into a conceptual framework that sheds light on the disorder that healthcare providers encounter.

"The continuous increase of Coccidioidomycosis cases requires reliable detection methods of the causal agent, Coccidioides spp., in its natural environment. This has proven challenging because of our limited knowledge on the distribution of this soil-dwelling fungus. Knowing the pathogen's geographic distribution and its relationship with the environment is crucial to identify potential areas of risk and to prevent disease outbreaks. The maximum entropy (Maxent) algorithm, Geographic Information System (GIS) and bioclimatic variables were combined to obtain current and future potential distribution models (DMs) of Coccidioides and its putative rodent reservoirs for Arizona, California and Baja California. We revealed that Coccidioides DMs constructed with presence records from one state are not well suited to predict distribution in another state, supporting the existence of distinct phylogeographic populations of Coccidioides. A great correlation between Coccidioides DMs and United States counties with high Coccidioidomycosis incidence was found. Remarkably, under future scenarios of climate change and high concentration of greenhouse gases, the probability of habitat suitability for Coccidioides increased. Overlap analysis between the DMs of rodents and Coccidioides, identified Neotoma lepida as one of the predominant co-occurring species in all three states. Considering rodents DMs would allow to implement better surveillance programs to monitor disease spread.

"BACKGROUND: Kissing bugs (Triatominae) are blood-feeding insects best known as the vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease. Considering the high epidemiological relevance of these vectors, their biology and bacterial symbiosis remains surprisingly understudied. While previous investigations revealed generally low individual complexity but high among-individual variability of the triatomine microbiomes, any consistent microbiome determinants have not yet been identified across multiple Triatominae species. METHODS: To obtain a more comprehensive view of triatomine microbiomes, we investigated the host-microbiome relationship of five Triatoma species sampled from white-throated woodrat (Neotoma albigula) nests in multiple locations across the USA. We applied optimised 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding with a novel 18S rRNA gene blocking primer to a set of 170 T. cruzi-negative individuals across all six instars. RESULTS: Triatomine gut microbiome composition is strongly influenced by three principal factors: ontogeny, species identity, and the environment. The microbiomes are characterised by significant loss in bacterial diversity throughout ontogenetic development. First instars possess the highest bacterial diversity while adult microbiomes are routinely dominated by a single taxon. Primarily, the bacterial genus Dietzia dominates late-stage nymphs and adults of T. rubida, T. protracta, and T. lecticularia but is not present in the phylogenetically more distant T. gerstaeckeri and T. sanguisuga. Species-specific microbiome composition, particularly pronounced in early instars, is further modulated by locality-specific effects. In addition, pathogenic bacteria of the genus Bartonella, acquired from the vertebrate hosts, are an abundant component of Triatoma microbiomes. CONCLUSION: Our study is the first to demonstrate deterministic patterns in microbiome composition among all life stages and multiple Triatoma species. We hypothesise that triatomine microbiome assemblages are produced by species- and life stage-dependent uptake of environmental bacteria and multiple indirect transmission strategies that promote bacterial transfer between individuals. Altogether, our study highlights the complexity of Triatominae symbiosis with bacteria and warrant further investigation to understand microbiome function in these important vectors. Video abstract.

"The incidence of nephrolithiasis is increasing worldwide. Understanding how gut microbiome influences oxalate homeostasis has the potential to offer new strategies to prevent nephrolithiasis. The literature was reviewed to gather the evidence on the association between gut microbiome, hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis, and to identify the therapeutic interventions focused on the gut microbiome that could decrease hyperoxaluria and prevent nephrolithiasis. Gut microbiome is constituted by a plethora of microbiota including Oxalobacter formigenes (Oxf) and lactobacilli. Oxf can degrade dietary oxalate and induce enteral oxalate secretion. Animal studies suggested an association between oral Oxf supplementation and a decrease in hyperoxaluria. However, human studies have showed inconsistent results. Oral supplementation of lactobacilli did not show benefit in decreasing the hyperoxaluria. Antibiotic exposure, by affecting the gut microbiome, has been associated with an increase in nephrolithiasis. In vivo studies suggest fecal transplantation as a potential treatment option for reducing nephrolithiasis, but needs further evaluation in clinical studies. The current evidence suggests an association between gut microbiome and nephrolithiasis. However, the strategies focused on modulating gut microbiome for decreasing hyperoxaluria and preventing nephrolithiasis need further research. Judicious use of antibiotics in those predisposed to nephrolithiasis offers a preventative strategy for decreasing nephrolithiasis.

"Lyme borreliosis and Relapsing fever are considered emerging and re-emerging diseases that cause major public health problems in endemic countries. Epidemiology and geographical distribution of these diseases are documented in the US and in Europe, yet in Mexico, studies are scarce and scattered. The aims of this study were (1) to present the first confirmatory evidence of an endemic case of Lyme disease in Mexico and (2) to analyze the epidemiological trend of these both diseases by compiling all the information published on Borrelia in Mexico. Two databases were compiled, one of human cases and another of wild and domestic animals in the country. The analysis included the evaluation of risk factors for the human population, the diversity of Borrelia species and their geographic distribution. Six Borrelia species were reported in a total of 1,347 reports, of which 398 were of humans. Women and children from rural communities were shown to be more susceptible for both Lyme borreliosis and Relapsing fever. The remaining reports were made in diverse mammalian species and ticks. A total of 17 mammalian species and 14 tick species were recorded as hosts for this bacterial genus. It is noteworthy that records of Borrelia were only made in 18 of the 32 states, mainly in northern and central Mexico. These results highlight the importance of performing further studies in areas where animal cases have been reported, yet no human studies have been done, in order to complete the epidemiological panorama for Lyme borreliosis and Relapsing fever. Finally, the search for Borrelia infections in other vertebrates, such as reptiles and amphibians is recommended to gain a more accurate view of Borrelia species and their distribution. The geographical approach presented herein justifies an intense sampling effort to improve epidemiological knowledge of these diseases to aid vector control and prevention programs.

"Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne RNA viruses that have been used extensively to study host antiviral responses. Often selected just to represent standard single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses in early studies, the Flavivirus genus over time has taught us how truly unique it is in its remarkable ability to target not just the RNA sensory pathways but also the cytosolic DNA sensing system for its successful replication inside the host cell. This review summarizes the main developments on the unexpected antagonistic strategies utilized by different flaviviruses, with RNA genomes, against the host cyclic GAMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cytosolic DNA sensing pathway in mammalian systems. On the basis of the recent advancements on this topic, we hypothesize that the mechanisms of viral sensing and innate immunity are much more fluid than what we had anticipated, and both viral and host factors will continue to be found as important factors contributing to the host innate immune system in the future.

"BACKGROUND: Microbiomes can have profound impacts on host biology and evolution, but to date, remain vastly understudied in spiders despite their unique and diverse predatory adaptations. This study evaluates closely related species of spiders and their host-microbe relationships in the context of phylosymbiosis, an eco-evolutionary pattern where the microbial community profile parallels the phylogeny of closely related host species. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we characterized the microbiomes of five species with known phylogenetic relationships from the family Theridiidae, including multiple closely related widow spiders (L. hesperus, L. mactans, L. geometricus, S. grossa, and P. tepidariorum). RESULTS: We compared whole animal and tissue-specific microbiomes (cephalothorax, fat bodies, venom glands, silk glands, and ovary) in the five species to better understand the relationship between spiders and their microbial symbionts. This showed a strong congruence of the microbiome beta-diversity of the whole spiders, cephalothorax, venom glands, and silk glands when compared to their host phylogeny. Our results support phylosymbiosis in these species and across their specialized tissues. The ovary tissue microbial dendrograms also parallel the widow phylogeny, suggesting vertical transfer of species-specific bacterial symbionts. By cross-validating with RNA sequencing data obtained from the venom glands, silk glands and ovaries of L. hesperus, L. geometricus, S. grossa, and P. tepidariorum we confirmed that several microbial symbionts of interest are viably active in the host. CONCLUSION: Together these results provide evidence that supports the importance of host-microbe interactions and the significant role microbial communities may play in the evolution and adaptation of their hosts.

"Every mammalian species harbours a gut microbiota, and variation in the gut microbiota within mammalian species can have profound effects on host phenotypes. In this review, we summarize recent evidence that gut microbiotas have influenced the course of mammalian adaptation and diversification. Associations with gut microbiotas have: (i) promoted the diversification of mammalian species by enabling dietary transitions onto difficult-to-digest carbon sources and toxic food items; (ii) shaped the evolution of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in mammalian species through the amplification of signals from the external environment and from postnatal developmental processes; and (iii) generated selection for host mechanisms, including innate and adaptive immune mechanisms, to control the gut microbiota for the benefit of host fitness. The stability of specific gut microbiotas within host species lineages varies substantially across the mammalian phylogeny, and this variation may alter the ultimate evolutionary outcomes of relationships with gut microbiotas in different mammalian clades. In some mammalian species, including humans, relationships with host species-specific gut microbiotas appear to have led to the evolution of host dependence on the gut microbiota for certain functions. These studies implicate the gut microbiota as a significant environmental factor and selective agent shaping the adaptive evolution of mammalian diet, phenotypic plasticity, gastrointestinal morphology and immunity. This article is part of the theme issue 'The role of the microbiome in host evolution'.

"BACKGROUND: Diseases are complex phenotypes often arising as an emergent property of a non-linear network of genetic and epigenetic interactions. To translate this resulting state into a causal relationship with a subset of regulatory features, many experiments deploy an array of laboratory assays from multiple modalities. Often, each of these resulting datasets is large, heterogeneous, and noisy. Thus, it is non-trivial to unify these complex datasets into an interpretable phenotype. Although recent methods address this problem with varying degrees of success, they are constrained by their scopes or limitations. Therefore, an important gap in the field is the lack of a universal data harmonizer with the capability to arbitrarily integrate multi-modal datasets. RESULTS: In this review, we perform a critical analysis of methods with the explicit aim of harmonizing data, as opposed to case-specific integration. This revealed that matrix factorization, latent variable analysis, and deep learning are potent strategies. Finally, we describe the properties of an ideal universal data harmonization framework. CONCLUSIONS: A sufficiently advanced universal harmonizer has major medical implications, such as (i) identifying dysregulated biological pathways responsible for a disease is a powerful diagnostic tool; (2) investigating these pathways further allows the biological community to better understand a disease's mechanisms; and (3) precision medicine also benefits from developments in this area, particularly in the context of the growing field of selective epigenome editing, which can suppress or induce a desired phenotype.

"Leucine decarboxylase (LDC) is a recently proposed enzyme with no official enzyme commission number yet. It is encoded by the Mus musculus gene Gm853 which is expressed at kidneys, generating isopentylamine, an alkylmonoamine that has not been described to be formed by any metazoan enzyme yet. Although the relevance of LDC in mammalian physiology has not been fully determined, isopentylamine is a potential modulator which may have effects on insulin secretion and healthy gut microbiota formation. The LDC is a stable enzyme that specifically decarboxylates L-leucine but does not decarboxylate ornithine or lysine as its paralogues ornithine decarboxylase (ODC; EC: 4.1.1.17) and lysine decarboxylase (KDC; EC: 4.1.1.18) do. It does not act as an antizyme inhibitor and does not decarboxylate branched amino acids such as valine and isoleucine as it is another paralogue valine decarboxylase (VDC; EC: 4.1.1.14). The crystal structure of the enzyme has not been determined yet but there are homologous structures with complete coverage in Protein Data Bank (PDB) which makes LDC a good candidate for comparative modelling.In this study, homology models of LDC were generated and used in cofactor and substrate docking to understand the structure/function relationship underlying the unique selectivity of LDC enzyme.

"BACKGROUND: Bartonella spp. are vector-borne pathogens transmitted to humans via blood-sucking arthropods. Rodents such as the black rat (Rattus rattus) and Norway rat (R. norvegicus) are thought to be the main reservoirs. An infection with rodent-associated Bartonella spp. may cause severe symptoms in humans such as endocarditis and neuroretinitis. The current knowledge of Bartonella prevalence in rats from western Europe is scarce. METHODS: Rats and a few other rodent by-catches were trapped in the context of a rodenticide resistance study at different sites in Flanders, Belgium. During dissection, biometric data were collected, and spleen tissues were taken. DNA was extracted from spleen samples and tested for Bartonella spp. by conventional generic polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To determine the Bartonella species, a selected number of amplicons were sequenced and compared with GenBank entries. RESULTS: In total, 1123 rodents were trapped. The predominate species was R. norvegicus (99.64%). Other rodents trapped included: two water voles (Arvicola amphibius, 0.18%); one colour rat (R. norvegicus forma domestica, 0.09%); and one muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus, 0.09%). PCR analysis of 1097 rodents resulted in 410 (37.37%, 95% CI: 34.50-40.31%) Bartonella spp. DNA-positive samples. Bartonella tribocorum (94.68%, 95% CI: 88.02-98.25%) was the most frequently detected Bartonella species, followed by B. grahamii (3.19%, 95% CI: 0.66-9.04%) and B. doshiae (1.06%, 95% CI: 0.03-5.79%). An uncultured Bartonella species occurred in one water vole (1.06%, 95% CI: 0.03-5.79%). There was a significantly higher Bartonella prevalence in older rats compared to juveniles and a significant difference in Bartonella prevalence concerning the localisation of trapping sites. In contrast, there was no statistically significant difference in Bartonella prevalence regarding sex, degree of urbanisation and season. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the high prevalence found, we conclude that the Norway rat seems to be a key reservoir host for zoonotic B. tribocorum in Belgium.

"The class Alphaproteobacteria is comprised of a diverse assemblage of Gram-negative bacteria that includes organisms of varying morphologies, physiologies and habitat preferences many of which are of clinical and ecological importance. Alphaproteobacteria classification has proved to be difficult, not least when taxonomic decisions rested heavily on a limited number of phenotypic features and interpretation of poorly resolved 16S rRNA gene trees. Despite progress in recent years regarding the classification of bacteria assigned to the class, there remains a need to further clarify taxonomic relationships. Here, draft genome sequences of a collection of genomes of more than 1000 Alphaproteobacteria and outgroup type strains were used to infer phylogenetic trees from genome-scale data using the principles drawn from phylogenetic systematics. The majority of taxa were found to be monophyletic but several orders, families and genera, including taxa recognized as problematic long ago but also quite recent taxa, as well as a few species were shown to be in need of revision. According proposals are made for the recognition of new orders, families and genera, as well as the transfer of a variety of species to other genera and of a variety of genera to other families. In addition, emended descriptions are given for many species mainly involving information on DNA G+C content and (approximate) genome size, both of which are confirmed as valuable taxonomic markers. Similarly, analysis of the gene content was shown to provide valuable taxonomic insights in the class. Significant incongruities between 16S rRNA gene and whole genome trees were not found in the class. The incongruities that became obvious when comparing the results of the present study with existing classifications appeared to be caused mainly by insufficiently resolved 16S rRNA gene trees or incomplete taxon sampling. Another probable cause of misclassifications in the past is the partially low overall fit of phenotypic characters to the sequence-based tree. Even though a significant degree of phylogenetic conservation was detected in all characters investigated, the overall fit to the tree varied considerably.

"RATIONALE: Chronic smoke exposure is associated with weight loss in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). However, the biological contribution of chronic smoking and sex on the cecal microbiome has not been previously investigated. METHODS: Adult male, female and ovariectomized mice were exposed to air (control group) or smoke for six months using a standard nose-only smoke exposure system. DNA was extracted from the cecal content using the QIAGEN QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit. Droplet digital PCR was used to generate total 16S bacterial counts, followed by Illumina MiSeq® analysis to determine microbial community composition. The sequencing data were resolved into Amplicon Sequence Variants and analyzed with the use of QIIME2®. Alpha diversity measures (Richness, Shannon Index, Evenness and Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity) and beta diversity (based on Bray-Curtis distances) were assessed and compared according to smoke exposure and sex. RESULTS: The microbial community was different between male and female mice, while ovariectomy made the cecal microbiome similar to that of male mice. Chronic smoke exposure led to significant changes in the cecal microbial community in both male and female mice. The organism, Alistipes, was the most consistent bacteria identified at the genus level in the cecal content that was reduced with chronic cigarette exposure and its expression was positively related to the whole-body weight of these mice. CONCLUSION: Chronic smoke exposure is associated with changes in the cecal content microbiome; these changes may play a role in the weight changes that are observed in cigarette smokers.

"Flea-borne typhus, due to Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia felis, is an infection causing fever, headache, rash, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, and diverse organ manifestations. Although most cases are self-limited, 26%-28% have complications and up to one-third require intensive care. Flea-borne typhus was recognized as an illness similar to epidemic typhus, but having a milder course, in the Southeastern United States and TX from 1913 into the 1920s. Kenneth Maxcy of the US Public Health Service (USPHS) first described the illness in detail and proposed a rodent reservoir and an arthropod vector. Other investigators of the USPHS (Eugene Dyer, Adolph Rumreich, Lucius Badger, Elmer Ceder, William Workman, and George Brigham) determined that the brown and black rats were reservoirs and various species of fleas, especially the Oriental rat flea, were the vectors. The disease was recognized as a health concern in the Southern United States in the 1920s and an increasing number of cases were observed in the 1930s and 1940s, with about 42,000 cases reported between 1931-1946. Attempts to control the disease in the 1930s by fumigation and rat proofing and extermination were unsuccessful. The dramatic increase in the number of cases from 1930 through 1944 was due to: the diversification of Southern agriculture away from cotton; the displacement of the smaller black rat by the larger brown rat in many areas; poor housing conditions during the Great Depression and World War II; and shortages of effective rodenticides and insecticides during World War II.

"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that has received an increasing amount of attention from virologists, clinicians, veterinarians, and epidemiologists over the past decade. The host range and animal reservoirs of HEV are rapidly expanding and a plethora of emerging HEV variants have been recently identified, some of which have the potential for interspecies infection. In this review, the detection of genetically diverse HEV variants, classified into and presumably associated with the species Orthohepevirus C, currently comprising HEV genotypes C1 and C2, by either serological or molecular approach is summarized. The distribution, genomic variability, and evolution of Orthohepevirus C are analyzed. Moreover, the potential risk of cross-species infection and zoonotic transmission of Orthohepevirus C are discussed.

"Fossil rodent middens are powerful tools in paleoecology. In arid parts of western North America, packrat (Neotoma spp.) middens preserve plant and animal remains for tens of thousands of years. Midden contents are so well preserved that fragments of endogenous ancient DNA (aDNA) can be extracted and analyzed across millennia. Here, we explore the use of shotgun metagenomics to study the aDNA obtained from packrat middens up to 32,000 C(14) years old. Eleven Illumina HiSeq 2500 libraries were successfully sequenced, and between 0.11% and 6.7% of reads were classified using Centrifuge against the NCBI ""nt"" database. Eukaryotic taxa identified belonged primarily to vascular plants with smaller proportions mapping to ascomycete fungi, arthropods, chordates, and nematodes. Plant taxonomic diversity in the middens is shown to change through time and tracks changes in assemblages determined by morphological examination of the plant remains. Amplicon sequencing of ITS2 and rbcL provided minimal data for some middens, but failed at amplifying the highly fragmented DNA present in others. With repeated sampling and deep sequencing, analysis of packrat midden aDNA from well-preserved midden material can provide highly detailed characterizations of past communities of plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi present as trace DNA fossils. The prospects for gaining more paleoecological insights from aDNA for rodent middens will continue to improve with optimization of laboratory methods, decreasing sequencing costs, and increasing computational power.

"One of the striking features of human social complexity is that we provide care to sick and contagious individuals, rather than avoiding them. Care-giving is a powerful strategy of disease control in human populations today; however, we are not the only species which provides care for the sick. Widespread reports occurring in distantly related species like cetaceans and insects suggest that the building blocks of care for the sick are older than the human lineage itself. This raises the question of what evolutionary processes drive the evolution of such care in animals, including humans. I synthesize data from the literature to evaluate the diversity of care-giving behaviors and conclude that across the animal kingdom there appear to be two distinct types of care-behaviors, both with separate evolutionary histories: (1) social care behaviors benefitting a sick individual by promoting healing and recovery and (2) community health behaviors that control pathogens in the environment and reduce transmission within the population. By synthesizing literature from psychology, anthropology, and biology, I develop a novel hypothesis (Hominin Pathogen Control Hypothesis) to explain how these two distinct sets of behaviors evolved independently then merged in the human lineage. The hypothesis suggests that social care evolved in association with offspring care systems whereas community health behaviors evolved as a type of niche construction. These two types of behaviors merged in humans to produce complex, multi-level healthcare networks in humans. Moreover, each type of care increases selection for the other, generating feedback loops that selected for increasing healthcare behaviors over time. Interestingly, domestication processes may have contributed to both social care and community health aspects of this process.

"BACKGROUND: High-altitude ecosystems are extreme environments that generate specific physiological, morphological, and behavioral adaptations in ectotherms. The shifts in gut microbiota of the ectothermic hosts as an adaptation to environmental changes are still largely unknown. We investigated the food ingested and the bacterial, fungal, and protistan communities in feces of the lizard Sceloporus grammicus inhabiting an altitudinal range using metabarcoding approaches. RESULTS: The bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the genera Bacteroides and Parabacteroides dominated the core fecal bacteriome, while Zygomycota and Ascomycota, and the species Basidiobolus ranarum and Basidiobolus magnus dominated the core fecal mycobiome. The diet of S. grammicus included 29 invertebrate families belonging to Arachnida, Chilopoda, and Insecta. The diversity and abundance of its diet decreased sharply at high altitudes, while the abundance of plant material and Agaricomycetes was significantly higher at the highest site. The composition of the fecal microbiota of S. grammicus was different at the three altitudes, but not between females and males. Dietary restriction in S. grammicus at 4150 m might explain the high fecal abundance of Akkermansia and Oscillopira, bacteria characteristic of long fasting periods, while low temperature favored B. magnus. A high proportion of bacterial functions were digestive in S. grammicus at 2600 and 3100, while metabolism of aminoacids, vitamins, and key intermediates of metabolic pathways were higher at 4150 m. Different assemblages of fungal species in the lizard reflect differences in the environments at different elevations. Pathogens were more prevalent at high elevations than at the low ones. CONCLUSIONS: Limiting food resources at high elevations might oblige S. grammicus to exploit other food resources and its intestinal microbiota have degradative and detoxifying capacities. Sceloporus grammicus might have acquired B. ranarum from the insects infected by the fungus, but its commensal relationship might be established by the quitinolytic capacities of B. ranarum. The mycobiome participate mainly in digestive and degradative functions while the bacteriome in digestive and metabolic functions.

"Determining which wildlife hosts are involved in the enzootic cycles of tick-borne diseases (TBD) enables enhanced surveillance and risk assessment of potential transmission to humans and domestic species. Currently, there is limited data to indicate which tick-borne pathogens (TBP) can infect coyotes. Additionally, limited surveillance data for white-tailed deer (WTD) in south Texas is available. The purpose of this study was to detect current infections of common TBP in coyotes and WTD in south Texas, which represents a transboundary region and common site for animal migrations across the U.S.-Mexico border. A patent pending real-time PCR assay, the TickPath layerplex test, was used to screen whole-blood samples for species from Borrelia, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Babesia genera. Conventional PCR and subsequent sequencing of positive samples confirmed the pathogen species. Of 122 coyote samples, 11/122 (9.0%) were positive for Babesia vogeli and 1/122 (0.8%) was positive for Borrelia turicatae. Of 245 WTD samples, 1/245 (0.4%) was positive for Anaplasma platys, 4/245 (1.6%) were positive for Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and 18/245 (7.3%) were positive for Theileria cervi. All positive samples from both species, except for one coyote, were collected from counties located in south Texas along the U.S.Mexico border. One coyote positive for B. vogeli originated from a county in northern Texas. The results from this study depicts the first known molecular detection of B. turicatae in a coyote, and demonstrates that coyotes and WTDs can potentially serve as sentinels for several zoonotic TBD as well as TBD that affect domestic animals.

"BACKGROUND: Understanding the drivers of Lyme disease incidence at broad spatial scales is critical for predicting and mitigating human disease risk. Previous studies have identified vector phenology and behavior, host community composition, and landscape features as drivers of variable Lyme disease risk. However, while the Lyme disease transmission cycles in the eastern and western USA involve different vector species (Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus, respectively), the role of vector-specific differences in transmission efficiency has not been directly examined. By comparing the performance of traits involved in vector competence between these two species, this study aims to identify how vector competence contributes to variable Lyme disease risk. METHODS: We used a suite of laboratory experiments to compare the performance of traits related to vector competence for the two USA Lyme disease vectors. For each species, we measured the rate of attachment to a common rodent host, the engorgement weight, and the efficiency of pathogen acquisition (host to tick) and pathogen transmission (tick to host) from laboratory mice. In measuring pathogen acquisition and transmission, we used two different pathogen strains, one sympatric with I. scapularis and one sympatric with I. pacificus, to assess the importance of vector-pathogen coevolutionary history in transmission dynamics. RESULTS: We found I. pacificus had significantly higher host attachment success and engorgement weights, but significantly lower pathogen transmission efficiency relative to I. scapularis. Molting success and pathogen acquisition did not differ between these two species. However, pathogen acquisition efficiency was significantly higher for both sympatric vector and pathogen strains than the allopatric pairings. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified species-specific vector traits as a potential driver of broad scale variation in Lyme disease risk in the USA. In particular, the exceedingly low rates of pathogen transmission from tick to host observed for I. pacificus may limit Lyme disease transmission efficiency in the western USA. Further, observed variation in pathogen acquisition between sympatric and allopatric vector-pathogen strains indicate that vector-pathogen coevolutionary history may play a key role in transmission dynamics. These findings underscore the need to consider vector traits and vector-pathogen coevolution as important factors governing regional Lyme disease risk.

"Use of emerging technology allowing for identification of genetic material from pathogens and endosymbionts in ticks collected from humans, domestic animals, wildlife, or the environment has resulted in an avalanche of new data on tick-microorganism associations. This rapidly growing stream of new information is a tremendous resource but also presents challenges, including how detection of pathogen genetic material in ticks should best be interpreted. There is a tendency in the more recent published literature to incorrectly use the term ""vector"" based on detection of pathogen genetic material from tick species not experimentally confirmed to serve as vectors of the pathogen in question. To serve as a vector of a horizontally maintained pathogen, such as a Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) Lyme borreliosis spirochete, the tick species in question must be capable of acquiring the pathogen while feeding in the larval or nymphal stage on an infectious host, maintaining it transstadially through the molt, and then transmitting the pathogen to a naïve host while feeding in the subsequent nymphal or adult stage. This review examines the experimental evidence for and against species of hard (ixodid) ticks from different genera to serve as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. Of the 18 Ixodes species ticks evaluated to date, 13 were experimentally confirmed as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. These studies focused primarily on the three major Lyme borreliosis agents: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii. In striking contrast, none of 8 tick species from other genera (1 Amblyomma species, 5 Dermacentor species, and 2 Haemaphysalis species) evaluated to date were unequivocally experimentally confirmed as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. The strength of the evidence for or against each tick species to serve as a vector of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes is discussed together with key knowledge gaps and research challenges.

"The genus Phlebovirus is a diverse group of globally occurring viruses, including tick-, mosquito-, and sand fly-borne pathogens. Phleboviruses have historically been classified by serological methods. However, molecular methods alone have been used to identify emergent novel and related strains in recent years. This makes reconciling the classification of historically and newly characterized viruses challenging. To address this in part, we describe the characterization of the genomes of the Frijoles and Chilibre species complex phleboviruses, and three unclassified phleboviruses isolated in the Americas: Caimito, Itaporanga, and Rio Grande viruses that had previously only been described at the serological level. With the exception of Itaporanga virus, the phleboviruses sequenced in this study are phylogenetically related to the current species Frijoles phlebovirus, Bujaru phlebovirus, or the Chagres antigenic complex. Unexpectedly, molecular and phylogenetic analysis suggests Chilibre and Caimito viruses are taxonomically related to the family Peribunyaviridae. These viruses have a genomic architecture similar to peribunyaviruses and form monophyletic groups within the genus Pacuvirus. Our data highlight the importance of reconciling serological and molecular taxonomic classification. In addition, we suggest the taxonomy of Chilibre and Caimito viruses should be revised.

"α- and β-pinene are well-known representatives of the monoterpenes group, and are found in many plants' essential oils. A wide range of pharmacological activities have been reported, including antibiotic resistance modulation, anticoagulant, antitumor, antimicrobial, antimalarial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-Leishmania, and analgesic effects. This article aims to summarize the most prominent effects of α- and β-pinene, namely their cytogenetic, gastroprotective, anxiolytic, cytoprotective, anticonvulsant, and neuroprotective effects, as well as their effects against H(2)O(2)-stimulated oxidative stress, pancreatitis, stress-stimulated hyperthermia, and pulpal pain. Finally, we will also discuss the bioavailability, administration, as well as their biological activity and clinical applications.

"Trypanosoma cruzi is a vector-borne, protozoal parasite of mammals. Infected humans, dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), and nonhuman primates may remain asymptomatic or may develop Chagas disease, most commonly characterized by lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis with myocardial degeneration and fibrosis, ultimately resulting in heart failure. Although wildlife species have important roles as sylvatic reservoirs, investigations into the pathology of T. cruzi in wildlife are limited to a few studies documenting histologic lesions in opossums (Didelphis spp.) and raccoons (Procyon lotor). Pathology in coyotes (Canis latrans) has not, to our knowledge, been described, despite their recognition as a reservoir and close genetic relationship to domestic dogs. Our objectives were to perform a detailed, comparative cardiac pathology study of sympatric, naturally infected coyotes and raccoons, to characterize the overall T. cruzi infection prevalence in the heart and blood of each species via PCR, and to identify infecting discrete typing units (DTUs). We sampled hunter-harvested coyotes (n=120) and raccoons (n=24) in a 28 county region of central and south Texas, US. Raccoons were significantly more likely to have positive PCR results (P<0.001) with a prevalence of 62% (15/24), comprising DTU TcIV exclusively, with mild to no evidence of cardiac pathology. In contrast, coyotes had a lower infection prevalence (8%, 10/120), comprising DTU TcI exclusively, with lymphoplasmacytic myocarditis observed in four of the six PCR-positive animals. Many raccoons had PCR-positive blood and heart tissue simultaneously, supporting previous reports that raccoons maintain parasitemia into chronic stages of infection; in contrast, none of the PCR-positive coyotes were positive in both heart and blood. Our findings demonstrate marked differences in T. cruzi infection dynamics between coyotes and raccoons, with important implications for reservoir potential and their role in transmission cycles.

"The New World (NW) arenaviruses are a diverse group of zoonotic viruses, including several causative agents of severe hemorrhagic fevers in humans. All known human-pathogenic NW arenaviruses belong to clade B, where they group into sublineages with phylogenetically closely related nonpathogenic viruses, e.g., the highly pathogenic Junin (JUNV) and Machupo viruses with the nonpathogenic Tacaribe virus (TCRV). Considering the close genetic relationship of nonpathogenic and pathogenic NW arenaviruses, the identification of molecular determinants of virulence is of great importance. The host cell's innate antiviral defense represents a major barrier for zoonotic infection. Here, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the innate immune responses against JUNV and TCRV in human cells. Despite similar levels of viral replication, infection with TCRV consistently induced a stronger type I interferon (IFN-I) response than JUNV infection did. Transcriptome profiling revealed upregulation of a largely overlapping set of interferon-stimulated genes in cells infected with TCRV and JUNV. Both viruses were relatively insensitive to IFN-I treatment of human cells and induced similar levels of apoptosis in the presence or absence of an IFN-I response. However, in comparison to JUNV, TCRV induced stronger activation of the innate sensor double-strand RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), resulting in phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2α. Confocal microscopy studies revealed similar subcellular colocalizations of the JUNV and TCRV viral replication-transcription complexes with PKR. However, deletion of PKR by CRISPR/Cas9 hardly affected JUNV but promoted TCRV multiplication, providing the first evidence for differential innate recognition and control of pathogenic and nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses by PKR.IMPORTANCE New World (NW) arenaviruses are a diverse family of emerging zoonotic viruses that merit significant attention as important public health problems. The close genetic relationship of nonpathogenic NW arenaviruses with their highly pathogenic cousins suggests that few mutations may be sufficient to enhance virulence. The identification of molecular determinants of virulence of NW arenaviruses is therefore of great importance. Here we undertook a side-by-side comparison of the innate immune responses against the highly pathogenic Junin virus (JUNV) and the related nonpathogenic Tacaribe virus (TCRV) in human cells. We consistently found that TCRV induces a stronger type I interferon (IFN-I) response than JUNV. Transcriptome profiling revealed an overlapping pattern of IFN-induced gene expression and similar low sensitivities to IFN-I treatment. However, the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) contributed to the control of TCRV, but not JUNV, providing the first evidence for differential innate recognition and control of JUNV and TCRV.

"Understanding the genetic underpinning of adaptive divergence among populations is a key goal of evolutionary biology and conservation. Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus) is a sagebrush obligate species with a constricted range consisting of seven discrete populations, each with distinctly different habitat and climatic conditions. Though geographically close, populations have low levels of natural gene flow resulting in relatively high levels of differentiation. Here, we use 15,033 SNP loci in genomic outlier analyses, genotype-environment association analyses, and gene ontology enrichment tests to examine patterns of putatively adaptive genetic differentiation in an avian species of conservation concern. We found 411 loci within 5 kbp of 289 putative genes associated with biological functions or pathways that were overrepresented in the assemblage of outlier SNPs. The identified gene set was enriched for cytochrome P450 gene family members (CYP4V2, CYP2R1, CYP2C23B, CYP4B1) and could impact metabolism of plant secondary metabolites, a critical challenge for sagebrush obligates. Additionally, the gene set was also enriched with members potentially involved in antiviral response (DEAD box helicase gene family and SETX). Our results provide a first look at local adaption for isolated populations of a single species and suggest adaptive divergence in multiple metabolic and biochemical pathways may be occurring. This information can be useful in managing this species of conservation concern, for example, to identify unique populations to conserve, avoid translocation or release of individuals that may swamp locally adapted genetic diversity, or guide habitat restoration efforts.

"African swine fever virus (ASFV) continues to threaten global animal health and agricultural biosecurity. Mitigating the establishment of ASFV in the United States (U.S.) is contingent on (1) the identification of arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts that are capable of viral maintenance and transmission in the U.S. and (2) knowledge of vector-host associations that may permit transmission. We aggregated data on vector competence, host competence and tick-host associations by systematic review of published articles and collection records to identify species that may support the invasion of ASFV in the U.S. Three species of competent soft ticks occur in the U.S., Ornithodoros coriaceus, Ornithodoros turicata, and Ornithodoros puertoricensis, however, vector competence for the majority of soft ticks in the U.S. remains unknown. Three species of competent vertebrate hosts currently occur in the U.S.: domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), feral hogs (Sus scrofa), and common warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus). Hierarchical hazard categories based on vector competence, tick-host contact rates, and vector abundance were used to semiquantitatively rank U.S. soft tick species by their relative risk for contributing to ASFV transmission to identify which soft tick species are a priority for future studies. High-risk vector and host species identified in this study can be used to focus ASFV risk assessments in the U.S., guide targeted surveillance and control strategies, and proactively prepare for an ASFV incursion event. Results indicate O. coriaceus, O. turicata, and O. puertoricensis demonstrate the highest relative risk for contributing to ASFV transmission in the U.S., however, many gaps in knowledge exist preventing the full evaluation of at least 30 soft tick species in the U.S. Further study is required to identify soft tick vectors that interact with feral swine populations, elucidate vector competence, and further understand the biology of soft tick species.

"While the vertebrate microbiota is critical to the normal function of many host traits, hosts may expend a large amount of energy to constrain and interface with their microbiota via their immune system to avoid the high fitness costs associated with gut dysbiosis, pathobionts, and opportunistic pathogens. All jawed vertebrates share mucosal immunity dedicated to isolating the microbiota, and a breakdown of this system can result in chronic gut inflammation. In humans, chronic gut inflammation negatively affects growth and development. There is little information available on the prevalence of chronic gut inflammation in wild animals, but given that animals with different life histories emphasize different immune responses, it follows that wild animals may vary in their susceptibility to chronic gut inflammation, and most animals will experience signaling that can lead to this state. These can be top-down signals originating from sources like the central nervous system or bottom-up signals originating from changes in the gut microbiota. The sources of these signals might include stress, developmental transitions, food restriction, and dietary shifts. Here, we briefly discuss host-microbiota interactions from the perspective of life history theory and ecoimmunology, focusing on the mucosal immune system and chronic gut inflammation. We also include future directions for research and the tools necessary to investigate them.

"Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are important phase I enzymes involved in the metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds mainly through mono-oxygenation reactions into more polar and easier to excrete species. In addition to their role in detoxification, they play important roles in the biosynthesis of endogenous compounds and the bioactivation of xenobiotics. Coumarins, phytochemicals abundant in food and commonly used in fragrances and cosmetics, have been shown to interact with P450 enzymes as substrates and/or inhibitors. In this review, these interactions and their significance in pharmacology and toxicology are discussed in detail.

"Brucella spp.is capable of causing disease in a range of animal hosts, and human brucellosis is regarded as a life-threating disease. A novel isothermal amplification technique, termed multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA), was employed for detecting all Brucella species strains. Brucella-MCDA targets the Bscp31 gene (Brucella species-specific gene) to specifically design a set of 10 primers. The Brucella-MCDA can be coupled with nanoparticles-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB) for highly specific, simple, rapid, and visual detection of Brucella-specific amplicons. Using the protocol, a MCDA amplification followed by 2 min LFB resulted in visualization of DNA products trapped at the LFB test line. Various species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains are applied for optimizing and evaluating the target assay. Optimal MCDA condition is found to be 63°C for 40 min, with detection limits at 10 fg of templates in the pure cultures. The specificity of MCDA-LFB technique is of 100%, and no cross-reactions to non-Brucella strains are observed according to the specificity examination. Furthermore, dUTP and AUDG enzyme are added into the MCDA reaction mixtures, which are used for removing false-positive amplification generating from carryover contamination. Thus, 20 min for rapid template extraction followed by AUDG digestion (5 min), MCDA (40 min) combined with LFB detection (2 min) resulted in a total assay time of ~70 min. In sum, Brucella-MCDA-LFB technique is a rapid, simple, reliable, and sensitive method to detect all Brucella species strains, and can be used as potential screening tool for Brucella strains in various laboratories.

"BACKGROUND: Conventionalmethods of detecting Brucella spp. suffer from technical and biological complications. Besides, newly characterized species of the genus Brucella could be neglected by previously designed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Therefore, a more accurate PCR-based test seems to be imminently needed MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 39 patients diagnosed with brucellosis and 25 healthy controls. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were performed on 500 Omp2-related protein and gene sequences. Thereafter, specific primers were designed and synthesized for the regions with highest conservancy. The collected samples were assessed by PCR test. To overcome the cross-reactivity issue, PCR thermal program was optimized regarding annealing time and temperature. RESULTS: The MSA results indicated that the N terminus region of the Omp2 protein (DNA 5’ end) is associated with highest conservancy. Primers with highest specificity were designed and synthesized. A two-step PCR reaction was successfully designed and optimized. The desirable bands were observed in clinical samples with high accuracy. CONCLUSION: It should be pointed out that using a precisely designed primer pair would bring about early infection detection, more success to detect all natural variants and higher cost-to-efficacy ratio in comparison to other detection methods

"The central aim of conservation biology is to understand and mitigate the effects of human activities on biodiversity. To successfully achieve this objective, researchers must take an interdisciplinary approach that fully considers the effects, both direct and indirect, of anthropogenic disturbances on wildlife physiology and health. A recent surge in research has revealed that host-associated microbiota-the archaeal, bacterial, fungal and viral communities residing on and inside organisms-profoundly influence animal health, and that these microbial communities can be drastically altered by anthropogenic activities. Therefore, conservation practitioners should consider the disruption of host-associated microbial diversity as a serious threat to wildlife populations. Despite the tremendous potential for microbiome research to improve conservation outcomes, few efforts have been made to truly integrate these fields. In this review, we call for the microbial renaissance of conservation biology, where biodiversity of host-associated microbiota is recognized as an essential component of wildlife management practices. Using evidence from the existing literature, we will examine the known effects of anthropogenic activities on the diversity of host-associated microbial communities and integrate approaches for maintaining microbial diversity to successfully achieve conservation objectives.

"Members of the genus Brucella are Gram-negative pathogens that cause chronic systemic infection in farm animals and zoonotic infection in humans. Study of the genus Brucella has been hindered by the need for biosafety level 3 select agent containment. Brucella neotomae, originally isolated from the desert pack rat, presented an opportunity to develop an alternative, non-select agent experimental model. Our prior in vitro work indicated that the cell biology and type IV secretion system (T4SS) dependence of B. neotomae intracellular replication were similar to observations for human-pathogenic select agent Brucella species. Therefore, here, we investigated the pathobiology of B. neotomae infection in the BALB/c mouse. During a sustained infectious course, B. neotomae replicated and persisted in reticuloendothelial organs. Bioluminescent imaging and histopathological and PCR-based analysis demonstrated that the T4SS contributed to efficient early infection of the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes; granuloma formation and hepatosplenomegaly; and early induction of Th1-associated cytokine gene expression. The infectious course and pathologies in the murine model showed similarity to prior observations of primate and native host infection with zoonotic Brucella species. Therefore, the B. neotomae BALB/c infection model offers a promising system to accelerate and complement experimental work in the genus Brucella.

"Brucellosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that may persist for long periods causing relapses in antibiotic-treated patients. The ability of Brucella to develop chronic infections is linked to their capacity to invade and replicate within the mononuclear phagocyte system, including the bone marrow (BM). Persistence of Brucella in the BM has been associated with hematological complications such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and pancytopenia in human patients. In the mouse model, we observed that the number of Brucella abortus in the BM remained constant for up to 168 days of postinfection. This persistence was associated with histopathological changes, accompanied by augmented numbers of BM myeloid GMP progenitors, PMNs, and CD4(+) lymphocytes during the acute phase (eight days) of the infection in the BM. Monocytes, PMNs, and GMP cells were identified as the cells harboring Brucella in the BM. We propose that the BM is an essential niche for the bacterium to establish long-lasting infections and that infected PMNs may serve as vehicles for dispersion of Brucella organisms, following the Trojan horse hypothesis. Monocytes are solid candidates for Brucella reservoirs in the BM.

"Recently, the incidence and awareness of tick-borne diseases in humans and animals have increased due to several factors, which in association favor the chances of contact among wild animals and their ectoparasites, domestic animals and humans. Wild and domestic carnivores are considered the primary source of tick-borne zoonotic agents to humans. Among emergent tick-borne pathogens, agents belonging to family Anaplasmataceae (Order Rickettsiales) agents stand out due their worldwide distribution and zoonotic potential. In this review we aimed to review the genetic diversity of the tick-transmitted genera Ehrlichia, Anaplasma and ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia sp."" in wild carnivores Caniformia (Canidae, Mustelidae and Ursidae) and Feliformia (Felidae, Hyanidae, Procyonidae and Viverridae) worldwide, discussing the implications for human and domestic animal health and wildlife conservation. Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) have been identified as hosts for Anaplasma spp. (A. phagocytophilum, Anaplasma ovis, A. platys), Ehrlichia canis and ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia sp."" (FU98 strain) and may contribute to the maintaenance of A. phagocytophilum in Europe. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) have been reported as hosts for E. canis, A. bovis, ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia lotoris"" and A. phagocytophilum, and play a role in the maintenance of A. phagocytophilum in the USA. Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) may play a role as hosts for A. bovis and A. phagocytophilum. New Ehrlichia and/or Anaplasma genotypes circulate in wild canids and felids from South America and Africa. While Ehrlichia sp. closely related to E. canis has been reported in wild felids from Brazil and Japan, Anaplasma sp. closely related to A. phagocytophilum has been detected in wild felids from Brazil and Africa. Red foxes and mustelids (otters) are exposed to E. canis in countries located in the Mediaterranean basin, probably as a consequence of spillover from domestic dogs. Similarly, E. canis occurs in procyonids in North (raccoons in USA, Spain) and South (Nasua nasua in Brazil) Hemispheres, in areas where E. canis is frequent in dogs. While ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia lotoris"" seems to be a common and specific agent of raccoons in the USA, ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia sp."" (FU98 strain) seems to show a broader range of hosts, since it has been detected in red fox, golden jackal (Canis aureus) and badger (Meles meles) in Europe so far. Brown (Ursus arctos) and black (Ursus americanus) bears seem to play a role as hosts for A. phagocytophilum in the North Hemisphere. Anaplasma bovis has been detected in wild Procyonidae, Canidae and Felidae in Asia and Brazil. In order to assess the real identity of the involved agents, future works should benefit from the application of MLST (Multi Locus Sequence Typing), WGS (Whole Genome Sequencing) and NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) technologies aiming at shedding some light on the role of wild carnivores in the epidemiology of Anaplasmataceae agents.

"Lyme disease, caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), is typically transmitted by hard-bodied ticks (Acari: Ixodidae). Whenever this tick-borne zoonosis is mentioned in medical clinics and emergency rooms, it sparks a firestorm of controversy. Denial often sets in, and healthcare practitioners dismiss the fact that this pathogenic spirochetosis is present in their area. For distribution of Bbsl across Canada, we conducted a 4-year, tick⁻host study (2013⁻2016), and collected ticks from avian and mammalian hosts from Atlantic Canada to the West Coast. Overall, 1265 ticks representing 27 tick species belonging to four genera were collected. Of the 18 tick species tested, 15 species (83%) were positive for Bbsl and, of these infected ticks, 6 species bite humans. Overall, 13 of 18 tick species tested are human-biting ticks. Our data suggest that a 6-tick, enzootic maintenance cycle of Bbsl is present in southwestern B.C., and five of these tick species bite humans. Biogeographically, the groundhog tick, Ixodes cookei, has extended its home range from central and eastern Canada to southwestern British Columbia (B.C.). We posit that the Fox Sparrow, Passerella iliaca, is a reservoir-competent host for Bbsl. The Bay-breasted Warbler, Setophaga castanea, and the Tennessee Warbler, Vermivora peregrina, are new host records for the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. We provide the first report of a Bbsl-positive Amblyomma longirostre larva parasitizing a bird; this bird parasitism suggests that a Willow Flycatcher is a competent reservoir of Bbsl. Our findings show that Bbsl is present in all provinces, and that multiple tick species are implicated in the enzootic maintenance cycle of this pathogen. Ultimately, Bbsl poses a serious public health contagion Canada-wide.

"BACKGROUND: In low elevation arid regions throughout the southern United States, Borrelia turicatae is the principal agent of tick-borne relapsing fever. However, endemic foci and the vertebrate hosts involved in the ecology of B. turicatae remain undefined. Experimental infection studies suggest that small and medium sized mammals likely maintain B. turicatae in nature, while the tick vector is a long-lived reservoir. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Serum samples from wild caught rodents, raccoons, and wild and domestic canids from 23 counties in Texas were screened for prior exposure to B. turicatae. Serological assays were performed using B. turicatae protein lysates and recombinant Borrelia immunogenic protein A (rBipA), a diagnostic protein that is unique to RF spirochetes and may be a species-specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Serological responses to B. turicatae were detected from 24 coyotes, one gray fox, two raccoons, and one rodent from six counties in Texas. These studies indicate that wild canids and raccoons were exposed to B. turicatae and are likely involved in the pathogen's ecology. Additionally, more work should focus on evaluating rodent exposure to B. turicatae and the role of these small mammals in the pathogen's maintenance in nature.

"KEY POINTS: An ex vivo preparation was developed to record from single sensory fibres innervating the glabrous skin of the mouse forepaw. The density of mechanoreceptor innervation of the forepaw glabrous skin was found to be three times higher than that of hindpaw glabrous skin. Rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that innervate Meissner's corpuscles were severalfold more responsive to slowly moving stimuli in the forepaw compared to those innervating hindpaw skin. We found a distinct group of small hairs in the centre of the mouse hindpaw glabrous skin that were exclusively innervated by directionally sensitive D-hair receptors. The directional sensitivity, but not the end-organ anatomy, were the opposite to D-hair receptors in the hairy skin. Glabrous skin hairs in the hindpaw are not ubiquitous in rodents, but occur in African and North American species that diverged more than 65 million years ago. ABSTRACT: Rodents use their forepaws to actively interact with their tactile environment. Studies on the physiology and anatomy of glabrous skin that makes up the majority of the forepaw are almost non-existent in the mouse. Here we developed a preparation to record from single sensory fibres of the forepaw and compared anatomical and physiological receptor properties to those of the hindpaw glabrous and hairy skin. We found that the mouse forepaw skin is equipped with a very high density of mechanoreceptors; >3 times more than hindpaw glabrous skin. In addition, rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that innervate Meissner's corpuscles of the forepaw were severalfold more sensitive to slowly moving mechanical stimuli compared to their counterparts in the hindpaw glabrous skin. All other mechanoreceptor types as well as myelinated nociceptors had physiological properties that were invariant regardless of which skin area they occupied. We discovered a novel D-hair receptor innervating a small group of hairs in the middle of the hindpaw glabrous skin in mice. These glabrous skin D-hair receptors were direction sensitive albeit with an orientation sensitivity opposite to that described for hairy skin D-hair receptors. Glabrous skin hairs do not occur in all rodents, but are present in North American and African rodent species that diverged more than 65 million years ago. The function of these specialized hairs is unknown, but they are nevertheless evolutionarily very ancient. Our study reveals novel physiological specializations of mechanoreceptors in the glabrous skin that likely evolved to facilitate tactile exploration.

"Aspiculuris tetraptera is a heteroxynematid nematoda infecting most of the laboratory animals, occasionally mice which represent the mostly used animal for biological, medical, and pharmacological studies. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of nematode parasites infection in the laboratory mice Mus musculus in Egypt. Morphologically, this oxyurid possessed four distinct cephalic papillae on a cephalic plate, with three small rudimental lips carrying two sessile poorly developed labial papillae and one pair of amphidial pores. Esophagus divided into cylindrical corpus and globular bulb. Distinct cervical alae interrupted at the level of esophago-intestinal junction forming an acute angle. At the caudal end, twelve caudal papillae in male worms while an ovijector apparatus opening and a vulva surrounded by protruded lips in females were observed. The general morphological criteria include this nematode with other Aspiculuris species which were compared in the present study. Molecular characterization based on 18SSU rDNA sequencing performed to confirm the taxonomic position of this species and to documents the morphological data. Sequence alignment detects a percent of identity up to 88.0% with other Heteroxynematidae species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the present recorded is a putative sister taxon to A. tetraptera recorded in a previous study. The SSU rDNA sequence has been deposited in the GenBank under the accession no. MG019400.

"The laboratory mouse Fv1 gene encodes a retroviral restriction factor that mediates resistance to murine leukemia viruses (MLVs). Sequence similarity between Fv1 and the gag protein of the murine endogenous retrovirus L (MuERV-L) family of ERVs suggests that Fv1 was coopted from an ancient provirus. Previous evolutionary studies found Fv1 orthologs only in the genus Mus Here, we describe identification of orthologous Fv1 sequences in several species belonging to multiple families of rodents outside the genus Mus We show that these Fv1 orthologs are in the same region of conserved synteny, between the genes Miip and Mfn2, suggesting a minimum insertion time of 45 million years for the ancient progenitor of Fv1 Our analysis also revealed that Fv1 was not detectable or heavily mutated in some lineages in the superfamily Muroidea, while, in concert with previous findings in the genus Mus, we found strong evidence of positive selection of Fv1 in the African clade in the subfamily Muridae Residues identified as evolving under positive selection include those that have been previously found to be important for restriction of multiple retroviral lineages. Taken together, these findings suggest that the evolutionary origin of Fv1 substantially predates Mus evolution, that the rodent Fv1 has been shaped by lineage-specific differential selection pressures, and that Fv1 has long been evolving under positive selection in the rodent family Muridae, supporting a defensive role that significantly antedates exposure to MLVs.IMPORTANCE Retroviruses have adapted to living in concert with their hosts throughout vertebrate evolution. Over the years, the study of these relationships revealed the presence of host proteins called restriction factors that inhibit retroviral replication in host cells. The first of these restriction factors to be identified, encoded by the Fv1 gene found in mice, was thought to have originated in the genus Mus In this study, we utilized genome database searches and DNA sequencing to identify Fv1 copies in multiple rodent lineages. Our findings suggest a minimum time of insertion into the genome of rodents of 45 million years for the ancestral progenitor of Fv1 While Fv1 is not detectable in some lineages, we also identified full-length orthologs showing signatures of a molecular ""arms race"" in a family of rodent species indigenous to Africa. This finding suggests that Fv1 in these species has been coevolving with unidentified retroviruses for millions of years.

"Wolves (Canis lupus) and their domesticated and close relatives, dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), have great differences in their diets and living environments. To the best of our knowledge, the fundamental question of how the abundance and function of the gut microbiota of domestic dogs evolved to adapt to the changes in host feeding habits has yet to be addressed. In this study, our comparative analyses of gut metagenomes showed that the abundance of gut microbiota between the two species have some significant differences. Furthermore, a number of taxa observed in higher numbers in domestic dogs are related to carbohydrate metabolism, which may be because that there were more complicated polysaccharides in dogs diets than that in wolves diets. A significant difference in the abundance of genes encoding glycosyltransferase family 34 (GT34), carbohydrate-binding module family 25 (CBM25), and glycoside hydrolase family 13 (GH13) between the gut microbiota metagenomes of domestic dogs and gray wolves also supported this observation. Furthermore, the domestic dog gut microbiota has greater valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism. This result showed that compared with wolves, the domestic dog diet contains a smaller amount of animal protein, which is consistent with the dietary composition of wolves and dogs. Our results indicate that the function and abundance of gut microbiota of domestic dogs has been adapted to domestication, which is of great significance for the ability of domestic dogs to adapt to changes in food composition.

"The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.

"Anthropophilic species (""commensal"" species) that are completely dependent upon anthropic habitats experience different selective pressures particularly in terms of food than their noncommensal counterparts. Using a next-generation sequencing approach, we characterized and compared the gut microflora community of 53 commensal Rattus rattus and 59 noncommensal Rattus satarae captured in 10 locations in the Western Ghats, India. We observed that, while species identity was important in characterizing the microflora communities of the two Rattus hosts, environmental factors also had a significant effect. While there was significant geographic variation in the microflora of the noncommensal R. satarae, there was no effect of geographic distance on gut microflora of the commensal R. rattus. Interestingly, host genetic distance did not significantly influence the community in either Rattus hosts. Collectively, these results indicate that a shift in habitat is likely to result in a change in the gut microflora community and imply that the gut microflora is a complex trait, influenced by various parameters in different habitats.

"Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm, is of great importance as a silk producer and as a powerful experimental model for the basic and applied research. Similar to other animals, abundant microorganisms live inside the silkworm gut; however, surprisingly, the microbiota of this model insect has not been well characterized to date. Here, we comprehensively characterized the gut microbiota of the domesticated silkworm and its wild relatives. Comparative analyses with the mulberry-feeding moths Acronicta major and Diaphania pyloalis revealed a highly diverse but distinctive silkworm gut microbiota despite thousands of years of domestication, and stage-specific signatures in both total (DNA-based) and active (RNA-based) bacterial populations, dominated by the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Most fungal sequences were assigned to the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Environmental factors, including diet and human manipulation (egg production), likely influence the silkworm gut composition. Despite a lack of spatial variation along the gut, microbial community shifts were apparent between early instars and late instars, in concert with host developmental changes. Our results demonstrate that the gut microbiota of silkworms assembles into increasingly identical community throughout development, which differs greatly from those of other mulberry-feeding lepidopterans from the same niche, highlighting host-specific effects on microbial associations and the potential roles these communities play in host biology.

"Phenotypic variation along environmental gradients can provide evidence suggesting local adaptation has shaped observed morphological disparities. These differences, in traits such as body and extremity size, as well as skin and coat pigmentation, may affect the overall fitness of individuals in their environments. The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is a marsupial that shows phenotypic variation across its range, one that has recently expanded into temperate environments. It is unknown, however, whether the variation observed in the species fits adaptive ecogeographic patterns, or if phenotypic change is associated with any environmental factors. Using phenotypic measurements of over 300 museum specimens of Virginia opossum, collected throughout its distribution range, we applied regression analysis to determine if phenotypes change along a latitudinal gradient. Then, using predictors from remote-sensing databases and a random forest algorithm, we tested environmental models to find the most important variables driving the phenotypic variation. We found that despite the recent expansion into temperate environments, the phenotypic variation in the Virginia opossum follows a latitudinal gradient fitting three adaptive ecogeographic patterns codified under Bergmann's, Allen's and Gloger's rules. Temperature seasonality was an important predictor of body size variation, with larger opossums occurring at high latitudes with more seasonal environments. Annual mean temperature predicted important variation in extremity size, with smaller extremities found in northern populations. Finally, we found that precipitation and temperature seasonality as well as low temperatures were strong environmental predictors of skin and coat pigmentation variation; darker opossums are distributed at low latitudes in warmer environments with higher precipitation seasonality. These results indicate that the adaptive mechanisms underlying the variation in body size, extremity size and pigmentation are related to the resource seasonality, heat conservation, and pathogen-resistance hypotheses, respectively. Our findings suggest that marsupials may be highly susceptible to environmental changes, and in the case of the Virginia opossum, the drastic phenotypic evolution in northern populations may have arisen rapidly, facilitating the colonization of seasonal and colder habitats of temperate North America.

"Identification of inter-individual variability for drug metabolism through cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) enzyme is important for understanding the differences in clinical responses to malaria and HIV. This study evaluates the distribution of CYP2B6 alleles, haplotypes and inferred metabolic phenotypes among subjects with different ethnicity in Botswana. A total of 570 subjects were analyzed for CYP2B6 polymorphisms at position 516 G > T (rs3745274), 785 A > G (rs2279343) and 983 T > C (rs28399499). Samples were collected in three districts of Botswana where the population belongs to Bantu (Serowe/Palapye and Chobe) and San-related (Ghanzi) ethnicity. The three districts showed different haplotype composition according to the ethnic background but similar metabolic inferred phenotypes, with 59.12%, 34.56%, 2.10% and 4.21% of the subjects having, respectively, an extensive, intermediate, slow and rapid metabolic profile. The results hint at the possibility of a convergent adaptation of detoxifying metabolic phenotypes despite a different haplotype structure due to the different genetic background. The main implication is that, while there is substantial homogeneity of metabolic inferred phenotypes among the country, the response to drugs metabolized via CYP2B6 could be individually associated to an increased risk of treatment failure and toxicity. These are important facts since Botswana is facing malaria elimination and a very high HIV prevalence.

"Human dengue viruses emerged from primate reservoirs, yet paradoxically dengue does not reach high titers in primate models. This presents a unique opportunity to examine the genetics of spillover versus reservoir hosts. The dengue virus 2 (DENV2) - encoded protease cleaves human STING, reducing type I interferon production and boosting viral titers in humans. We find that both human and sylvatic (reservoir) dengue viruses universally cleave human STING, but not the STING of primates implicated as reservoir species. The special ability of dengue to cleave STING is thus specific to humans and a few closely related ape species. Conversion of residues 78/79 to the human-encoded 'RG' renders all primate (and mouse) STINGs sensitive to viral cleavage. Dengue viruses may have evolved to increase viral titers in the dense and vast human population, while maintaining decreased titers and pathogenicity in the more rare animals that serve as their sustaining reservoir in nature.

"Natural infection of captive nonhuman primates (NHPs) with Trypanosoma cruzi (agent of Chagas disease) is an increasingly recognized problem in facilities across the southern USA, with negative consequences for NHP health and biomedical research. We explored a central Texas NHP facility as a nidus of transmission by characterizing parasite discrete typing units (DTU) in seropositive rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), identifying the wildlife reservoirs, and characterizing vector infection. In seropositive NHPs, we documented low and intermittent concentrations of circulating T. cruzi DNA, with two DTUs in equal proportions, TcI and TcIV. In contrast, consistently high concentrations of T. cruzi DNA were found in wild mesomammals at the facility, yet rodents were PCR-negative. Strong wildlife host associations were found in which raccoons (Procyon lotor) harbored TcIV and opossums (Didelphis virginiana) harbored TcI, while skunks (Mephitis mephitis) were infected with both DTUs. Active and passive vector surveillance yielded three species of triatomines from the facility and in proximity to the NHP enclosures, with 17% T. cruzi infection prevalence. Interventions to protect NHP and human health must focus on interrupting spillover from the robust sylvatic transmission in the surrounding environment.

"Maintaining genetic diversity is a crucial component in conserving threatened species. For the iconic Australian koala, there is little genetic information on wild populations that is not either skewed by biased sampling methods (e.g., sampling effort skewed toward urban areas) or of limited usefulness due to low numbers of microsatellites used. The ability to genotype DNA extracted from koala scats using next-generation sequencing technology will not only help resolve location sample bias but also improve the accuracy and scope of genetic analyses (e.g., neutral vs. adaptive genetic diversity, inbreeding, and effective population size). Here, we present the successful SNP genotyping (1272 SNP loci) of koala DNA extracted from scat, using a proprietary DArTseq(™) protocol. We compare genotype results from two-day-old scat DNA and 14-day-old scat DNA to a blood DNA template, to test accuracy of scat genotyping. We find that DNA from fresher scat results in fewer loci with missing information than DNA from older scat; however, 14-day-old scat can still provide useful genetic information, depending on the research question. We also find that a subset of 209 conserved loci can accurately identify individual koalas, even from older scat samples. In addition, we find that DNA sequences identified from scat samples through the DArTseq(™) process can provide genetic identification of koala diet species, bacterial and viral pathogens, and parasitic organisms.

"African swine fever (ASF) is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), which can cause substantial morbidity and mortality events in swine. The virus can be transmitted via direct and indirect contacts with infected swine, their products, or competent vector species, especially Ornithodoros ticks. Africa and much of Eastern Europe are endemic for ASF; a viral introduction to countries that are currently ASF free could have severe economic consequences due to the loss of production from infected animals and the trade restrictions that would likely be imposed as a result of an outbreak. We identified vulnerabilities that could lead to ASFV introduction or persistence in the United States or other ASF-free regions. Both legal and illegal movements of live animals, as well as the importation of animal products, byproducts, and animal feed, pose a risk of virus introduction. Each route is described, and current regulations designed to prevent ASFV and other pathogens from entering the United States are outlined. Furthermore, existing ASFV research gaps are highlighted. Laboratory experiments to evaluate multiple species of Ornithodoros ticks that have yet to be characterized would be useful to understand vector competence, host preferences, and distribution of competent soft tick vectors in relation to high pig production areas as well as regions with high feral swine (wild boar or similar) densities. Knowledge relative to antigenic viral proteins that contribute to host response and determination of immune mechanisms that lead to protection are foundational in the quest for a vaccine. Finally, sampling of illegally imported and confiscated wild suid products for ASFV could shed light on the types of products being imported and provide a more informed perspective relative to the risk of ASFV importation.

"OBJECTIVE: Marijuana (Cannabis spp.) growing operations (MGO) in California have increased substantially since the mid-1990s. One environmental side-effect of MGOs is the extensive use of anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) to prevent damage to marijuana plants caused by wild rodents. In association with a long-term demographic study, we report on an observation of brodifacoum AR exposure in a threatened species, the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina), found freshly dead within 669-1347 m of at least seven active MGOs. RESULTS: Liver and blood samples from the dead northern spotted owl were tested for 12 rodenticides. Brodifacoum was the only rodenticide detected in the liver (33.3-36.3 ng/g) and blood (0.48-0.54 ng/ml). Based on necropsy results, it was unclear what role brodifacoum had in the death of this bird. However, fatal AR poisoning has been previously reported in owls with relatively low levels of brodifacoum residues in the liver. One likely mechanism of AR transmission from MGOs to northern spotted owls in California is through ingestion of AR contaminated prey that frequent MGOs. The proliferation of MGOs with their use of ARs in forested landscapes used by northern spotted owls may pose an additional stressor for this threatened species.

"BACKGROUND: Brucellosis is a chronic bacterial disease caused by members of the genus Brucella. Among the classical species stands Brucella neotomae, until now, a pathogen limited to wood rats. However, we have identified two brucellosis human cases caused by B. neotomae, demonstrating that this species has zoonotic potential. CASES PRESENTATION: Within almost 4 years of each other, a 64-year-old Costa Rican white Hispanic man and a 51-year-old Costa Rican white Hispanic man required medical care at public hospitals of Costa Rica. Their hematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limits. No adenopathies or visceral abnormalities were found. Both patients showed intermittent fever, disorientation, and general malaise and a positive Rose Bengal test compatible with Brucella infection. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures rendered Gram-negative coccobacilli identified by genomic analysis as B. neotomae. After antibiotic treatment, the patients recovered with normal mental activities. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report describing in detail the clinical disease caused by B. neotomae in two unrelated patients. In spite of previous claims, this bacterium keeps zoonotic potential. Proposals to generate vaccines by using B. neotomae as an immunogen must be reexamined and countries housing the natural reservoir must consider the zoonotic risk.

"In the United States, ticks transmit the greatest diversity of arthropod-borne pathogens and are responsible for the most cases of all vector-borne diseases. In recent decades, the number of reported cases of notifiable tick-borne diseases has steadily increased, geographic distributions of many ticks and tick-borne diseases have expanded, and new tick-borne disease agents have been recognized. In this review, we (1) describe the known disease agents associated with the most commonly human-biting ixodid ticks, (2) review the natural histories of these ticks and their associated pathogens, (3) highlight spatial and temporal changes in vector tick distributions and tick-borne disease occurrence in recent decades, and (4) identify knowledge gaps and barriers to more effective prevention of tick-borne diseases. We describe 12 major tick-borne diseases caused by 15 distinct disease agents that are transmitted by the 8 most commonly human-biting ixodid ticks in the United States. Notably, 40% of these pathogens were described within the last two decades. Our assessment highlights the importance of animal studies to elucidate how tick-borne pathogens are maintained in nature, as well as advances in molecular detection of pathogens which has led to the discovery of several new tick-borne disease agents.

"Wild animals' immune responses contribute to their evolutionary fitness. These responses are moulded by selection to be appropriate to the actual antigenic environment in which the animals live, but without imposing an excessive energetic demand which compromises other component of fitness. But, exactly what these responses are, and how they compare with those of laboratory animals, has been little studied. Here, we review the very small number of published studies of immune responses of wild rodents, finding general agreement that their humoral (antibody) responses are highly elevated when compared with those of laboratory animals, and that wild rodents' cellular immune system reveals extensive antigenic exposure. In contrast, proliferative and cytokine responses of ex vivo-stimulated immune cells of wild rodents are typically depressed compared with those of laboratory animals. Collectively, these responses are appropriate to wild animals' lives, because the elevated responses reflect the cumulative exposure to infection, while the depressed proliferative and cytokine responses are indicative of effective immune homeostasis that minimizes immunopathology. A more comprehensive understanding of the immune ecology of wild animals requires (i) understanding the antigenic load to which wild animals are exposed, and identification of any key antigens that mould the immune repertoire, (ii) identifying immunoregulatory processes of wild animals and the events that induce them, and (iii) understanding the actual resource state of wild animals, and the immunological consequences that flow from this. Together, by extending studies of wild rodents, particularly addressing these questions (while drawing on our immunological understanding of laboratory animals), we will be better able to understand how rodents' immune responses contribute to their fitness in the wild.

"Defining spatial and temporal occurrences of triatomine vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the agent of Chagas disease, in the US is critical for public health protection. Through a citizen science program and field collections from 2012 to 2016, we collected 3,215 triatomines, mainly from Texas. Using morphological and molecular approaches, we identified seven Triatoma species and report sex, length, and blood engorgement status. Many citizen-collected triatomines (92.9%) were encountered indoors, in peridomestic settings, or in dog kennels and represent spillover transmission risk of T. cruzi to humans and domestic animals. The most commonly collected species were Triatoma gerstaeckeri and Triatoma sanguisuga. Adult T. gerstaeckeri were collected from May to September, peaking from June to July, whereas adult T. sanguisuga were active later, from June to October, peaking from July to September. Based on cross correlation analyses, peaks of captures varied by species and across years. Point pattern analyses revealed unique occurrences of T. sanguisuga in north and east Texas, T. gerstaeckeri in south and west Texas, Triatoma indictiva and Triatoma lecticularia in central Texas, and Triatoma rubida in west Texas. These relatively unique spatial occurrences suggest associations with different suitable habitats and serve as a basis for future models evaluating the ecological niches of different vector species. Understanding the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of triatomines in the southern United States will improve targeted interventions of vector control and will guide public outreach and education to reduce human and animal contact with vectors and reduce the risk of exposure to T. cruzi.

"BACKGROUND: Programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a gene expression mechanism which enables the translation of two N-terminally coincident, C-terminally distinct protein products from a single mRNA. Many viruses utilize PRF to control or regulate gene expression, but very few phylogenetically conserved examples are known in vertebrate genes. Additional sex combs-like (ASXL) genes 1 and 2 encode important epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory proteins that control the expression of homeotic genes during key developmental stages. Here we describe an ~150-codon overlapping ORF (termed TF) in ASXL1 and ASXL2 that, with few exceptions, is conserved throughout vertebrates. RESULTS: Conservation of the TF ORF, strong suppression of synonymous site variation in the overlap region, and the completely conserved presence of an EH[N/S]Y motif (a known binding site for Host Cell Factor-1, HCF-1, an epigenetic regulatory factor), all indicate that TF is a protein-coding sequence. A highly conserved UCC_UUU_CGU sequence (identical to the known site of +1 ribosomal frameshifting for influenza virus PA-X expression) occurs at the 5' end of the region of enhanced synonymous site conservation in ASXL1. Similarly, a highly conserved RG_GUC_UCU sequence (identical to a known site of -2 ribosomal frameshifting for arterivirus nsp2TF expression) occurs at the 5' end of the region of enhanced synonymous site conservation in ASXL2. CONCLUSIONS: Due to a lack of appropriate splice forms, or initiation sites, the most plausible mechanism for translation of the ASXL1 and 2 TF regions is ribosomal frameshifting, resulting in a transframe fusion of the N-terminal half of ASXL1 or 2 to the TF product, termed ASXL-TF. Truncation or frameshift mutants of ASXL are linked to myeloid malignancies and genetic diseases, such as Bohring-Opitz syndrome, likely at least in part as a result of gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects. Our hypothesis now indicates that these disease-associated mutant forms represent overexpressed defective versions of ASXL-TF. REVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Laurence Hurst and Eugene Koonin.

"Projections around the globe suggest an increase in tick-vectored disease incidence and distribution, and the potential for emergence of novel tick-borne pathogens. Lyme disease is the most common reported tick-borne illness in the Unites States and is prevalent throughout much of central Europe. In recent years, the worldwide burden of Lyme disease has increased and extended into regions and countries where the disease was not previously reported. In this review, we discuss the trends for increasing Lyme disease, and examine the factors driving Lyme disease expansion, including the effect of climate change on the spread of vector Ixodid ticks and reservoir hosts; and the impacts of increased awareness on disease reporting and diagnosis. To understand the growing threat of Lyme disease, we need to study the interplay between vector, reservoir, and pathogen. In addition, we need to understand the contributions of climate conditions to changes in disease risk.

"Wildlife species are critical for both feeding vectors and serving as reservoirs of zoonotic vector-borne pathogens. Transmission pathways leading to disease in humans or other target taxa might be better understood and managed given a complete understanding of the relative importance of different reservoir species in nature. Using the conceptual framework of ""reservoir potential,"" which considers elements of both reservoir competence and vector-host contact, we review the wildlife reservoirs of Trypanosoma cruzi in the southern United States, where many species of triatomine vectors occur and wildlife maintain enzootic cycles that create a risk of spillover to humans, domestic dogs, and captive nonhuman primates that may develop Chagas disease. We reviewed 77 published reports of T. cruzi infection in at least 26 wildlife species across 15 southern states. Among the most well-studied and highly infected reservoirs are raccoon (Procyon lotor), woodrat (Neotoma spp.), and opossum (Didelphis virginiana), with aggregate overall infection prevalences of 36.4, 34.7, and 22.9%, respectively. Just over 60% of studies utilized methods from which an infectiousness index could be generated and show that raccoons and striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) are among the most infectious wildlife hosts. Triatomine-host contact has sparsely been quantified in the southern United States, but 18 of the 24 host species previously identified to have been fed upon by triatomines are wildlife. Future studies to parameterize the reservoir potential model, especially to quantify wildlife infectiousness, vector-host contact, and the epidemiological importance of parasite strains maintained by wildlife, could open new doors for managing enzootic cycles and reducing T. cruzi spillover risk.

"Hemorrhagic fevers caused by viruses were identified in the late 1950s in South America. These viruses have existed in their hosts, the New World rodents, for millions of years. Their emergence as infectious agents in humans coincided with changes in the environment and farming practices that caused explosions in their host rodent populations. Zoonosis into humans likely occurs because the pathogenic New World arenaviruses use human transferrin receptor 1 to enter cells. The mortality rate after infection with these viruses is high, but the mechanism by which disease is induced is still not clear. Possibilities include direct effects of cellular infection or the induction of high levels of cytokines by infected sentinel cells of the immune system, leading to endothelia and thrombocyte dysfunction and neurological disease. Here we provide a review of the ecology and molecular and cellular biology of New World arenaviruses, as well as a discussion of the current animal models of infection. The development of animal models, coupled with an improved understanding of the infection pathway and host response, should lead to the discovery of new drugs for treating infections.

"Angiostrongylus cantonensis, the rat lungworm, was the cause of neural larval migrans in two nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) and one Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) from the southeastern United States. Histologic findings in all three cases included eosinophilic meningoencephalitis with variable numbers of nematode larvae in the meninges or the neuroparenchyma. In two of the three cases, nematodes were extracted from brain tissue via a ""squash prep"" method. Identification of the nematodes was confirmed by amplification and sequence analysis of the partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene from all three cases. Sequences (704bp) from the two cases from Louisiana were identical and 99.7% similar to nematodes detected in the armadillo from Florida. As A. cantonensis is now considered endemic in the southern United States, it should be considered as an important differential for any wild or domestic animal or human patient with neurological signs and eosinophilic meningitis. Many wildlife species frequently consume snails and slugs and could serve as sentinels for the detection of this parasite in regions where the presence of this parasite has not been confirmed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of neural larval migrans due to A. cantonensis in an armadillo and provides additional documentation that this nematode can cause disease in wildlife species in the southeastern United States.

"Our understanding of the diverse interactions between hosts and microbes has grown profoundly over the past two decades and, as a product, has revolutionized our knowledge of the life sciences. Through primarily laboratory experiments, the current framework for holobionts and their respective hologenomes aims to decipher the underpinnings and implications of symbioses between host and microbiome. However, the laboratory setting restricts the full spectrum of host-associated symbionts as compared to those found in nature; thus, limiting the potential for a holistic interpretation of the functional roles the microbiome plays in host biology. When holobionts are studied in nature, associated microbial communities vary considerably between conditions, resulting in more microbial associates as part of the ""hologenome"" across environments than in either environment alone. We review and synthesize empirical evidence suggesting that hosts may associate with a larger microbial network that, in part, corresponds to experiencing diverse environmental conditions. To conceptualize the interactions between host and microbiome in an ecological context, we suggest the ""host-associated microbial repertoire,"" which is the sum of microbial species a host may associate with over the course of its life-history under all encountered environmental circumstances. Furthermore, using examples from both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, we discuss how this concept may be used as a framework to compare the ability of the holobiont to acclimate and adapt to environmental variation, and propose three ""signatures"" of the concept.

"Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in temperate regions of North America, Europe and Asia, and the number of reported cases has increased in many regions as landscapes have been altered. Although there has been extensive work on the ecology and epidemiology of this disease in both Europe and North America, substantial uncertainty exists about fundamental aspects that determine spatial and temporal variation in both disease risk and human incidence, which hamper effective and efficient prevention and control. Here we describe areas of consensus that can be built on, identify areas of uncertainty and outline research needed to fill these gaps to facilitate predictive models of disease risk and the development of novel disease control strategies. Key areas of uncertainty include: (i) the precise influence of deer abundance on tick abundance, (ii) how tick populations are regulated, (iii) assembly of host communities and tick-feeding patterns across different habitats, (iv) reservoir competence of host species, and (v) pathogenicity for humans of different genotypes of Borrelia burgdorferi Filling these knowledge gaps will improve Lyme disease prevention and control and provide general insights into the drivers and dynamics of this emblematic multi-host-vector-borne zoonotic disease.This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.

"We established a new Brucella neotomaein vitro model system for study of type IV secretion system-dependent (T4SS) pathogenesis in the Brucella genus. Importantly, B. neotomae is a rodent pathogen, and unlike B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis, B. neotomae has not been observed to infect humans. It therefore can be handled more facilely using biosafety level 2 practices. More particularly, using a series of novel fluorescent protein and lux operon reporter systems to differentially label pathogens and track intracellular replication, we confirmed T4SS-dependent intracellular growth of B. neotomae in macrophage cell lines. Furthermore, B. neotomae exhibited early endosomal (LAMP-1) and late endoplasmic reticulum (calreticulin)-associated phagosome maturation. These findings recapitulate prior observations for human-pathogenic Brucella spp. In addition, during coinfection experiments with Legionella pneumophila, we found that defective intracellular replication of a B. neotomae T4SS virB4 mutant was rescued and baseline levels of intracellular replication of wild-type B. neotomae were significantly stimulated by coinfection with wild-type but not T4SS mutant L. pneumophila Using confocal microscopy, it was determined that intracellular colocalization of B. neotomae and L. pneumophila was required for rescue and that colocalization came at a cost to L. pneumophila fitness. These findings were not completely expected based on known temporal and qualitative differences in the intracellular life cycles of these two pathogens. Taken together, we have developed a new system for studying in vitroBrucella pathogenesis and found a remarkable T4SS-dependent interplay between Brucella and Legionella during macrophage coinfection.

"Chagas is a potentially fatal chronic disease affecting large numbers of people across the Americas and exported throughout the world through human population movement. It is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite, which is transmitted by triatomine vectors to humans and a wide range of alternative host species. The database described here was compiled to allow the risk of vectorial transmission to humans to be mapped using geospatial models. The database collates all available records, published since 2003, for prevalence and occurrence of infection in humans, vectors and alternative hosts, and links each record to a defined time and location. A total of 16,802 records of infection have been extracted from the published literature and unpublished sources. The resulting database can be used to improve our understanding of the geographic variation in vector infection prevalence and to estimate the risk of vectorial transmission of T. cruzi to humans.

"Bats are important reservoirs for many zoonotic pathogens. However, no surveys of bacterial pathogens in bats have been performed in the Caucasus region. To understand the occurrence and distribution of bacterial infections in these mammals, 218 bats belonging to eight species collected from four regions of Georgia were examined for Bartonella, Brucella, Leptospira, and Yersinia using molecular approaches. Bartonella DNA was detected in 77 (35%) bats from all eight species and was distributed in all four regions. The prevalence ranged 6-50% per bat species. The Bartonella DNA represented 25 unique genetic variants that clustered into 21 lineages. Brucella DNA was detected in two Miniopterus schreibersii bats and in two Myotis blythii bats, all of which were from Imereti (west-central region). Leptospira DNA was detected in 25 (13%) bats that included four M. schreibersii bats and 21 M. blythii bats collected from two regions. The Leptospira sequences represented five genetic variants with one of them being closely related to the zoonotic pathogen L. interrogans (98.6% genetic identity). No Yersinia DNA was detected in the bats. Mixed infections were observed in several cases. One M. blythii bat and one M. schreibersii bat were co-infected with Bartonella, Brucella, and Leptospira; one M. blythii bat and one M. schreibersii bat were co-infected with Bartonella and Brucella; 15 M. blythii bats and three M. schreibersii bats were co-infected with Bartonella and Leptospira. Our results suggest that bats in Georgia are exposed to multiple bacterial infections. Further studies are needed to evaluate pathogenicity of these agents to bats and their zoonotic potential.

"BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease throughout the Americas. Few population-level studies have examined the epidemiology of canine infection and strain types of T. cruzi that infect canines in the USA. We conducted a cross-sectional study of T. cruzi infection in working hound dogs in south central Texas, including analysis of triatomine vectors collected within kennel environments. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Paired IFA and Chagas Stat-Pak serological testing showed an overall seroprevalence of 57.6% (n = 85), with significant variation across kennels. Dog age had a marginally significant effect on seropositivity, with one year of age increase associated with a 19.6% increase in odds of being seropositive (odds ratio 95% CI 0.996-1.435; p = 0.055). PCR analyses of blood revealed 17.4% of dogs harbored parasite DNA in their blood, including both seronegative and seropositive dogs. Molecular screening of organs from opportunistically sampled seropositive dogs revealed parasite DNA in heart, uterus, and mammary tissues. Strain-typing showed parasite discrete typing units (DTU) TcI and TcIV present in dog samples, including a co-occurrence of both DTUs in two individual dogs. Bloodmeal analysis of Triatoma gerstaeckeri and Triatoma sanguisuga insects collected from the kennels revealed exclusively dog DNA. Vector infection with T. cruzi was 80.6% (n = 36), in which T. gerstaeckeri disproportionately harbored TcI (p = 0.045) and T. sanguisuga disproportionately harbored TcIV (p = 0.029). Tracing infection status across dog litters showed some seropositive offspring of seronegative dams, suggesting infection of pups from local triatomine vectors rather than congenital transmission. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Canine kennels are high-risk environments for T. cruzi transmission, in which dogs likely serve as the predominant parasite reservoir. Disease and death of working dogs from Chagas disease is associated with unmeasured yet undoubtedly significant financial consequences because working dogs are highly trained and highly valued.

"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne diseases, particularly Lyme disease, are emerging across the northern hemisphere. In order to manage emerging diseases and predict where emergence will likely occur, it is necessary to understand the factors influencing the distribution, abundance and infection prevalence of vector species. In North America, Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease and is transmitted by blacklegged ticks. This study aimed to explore the abiotic and environmental drivers of density and infection prevalence of western blacklegged ticks (Ixodes pacificus) in southern California, an understudied and densely populated region of North America. RESULTS: Over the course of this two-year study, densities of I. pacificus adults were consistently positively associated with host availability for juvenile ticks and dense oak woodland habitat. Densities of nymphal and larval I. pacificus, on the other hand were primarily predicted by host availability for juvenile ticks in the first year of the study, and by habitat characteristics such as dense leaf litter in the second year. Infection with the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu stricto), and related spirochetes was not predicted by the abiotic conditions promoting I. pacificus populations, but rather by diversity of the tick community, and in particular by the presence of two Ixodes tick species that do not generally feed on humans (Ixodes spinipalpis and Ixodes peromysci). Borrelia spp. infection was not detected in the I. pacificus populations sampled, but was detected in other vector species that may maintain enzootic transmission of the pathogen on the landscape. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified dense oak woodlands as high-risk habitats for I. pacificus tick encounter in southern California. The shift in relative importance of host availability to habitat characteristics in predicting juvenile tick abundance occurred as California's historic drought intensified, suggesting that habitat providing suitable microclimates for tick survivorship became centrally important to patterns of abundance in the face of deleterious abiotic conditions. These results underscore the need for further investigation of the effects of climate change on tick-borne disease in California. Finally, despite low risk of human Lyme disease infection posed by I. pacificus in southern California, evidence of infection was found in other tick species, suggesting that enzootic transmission of tick-borne borreliae may be occurring in southern California, and involve parallel enzootic cycles with other tick and host species but not necessarily humans.

"The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi causes Chagas disease, uses kissing bugs as a vector, and is maintained in nature by a variety of wildlife reservoirs. Many natural cases of Chagas disease have been reported in NHP at facilities across the southern United States, where infected vectors and wildlife occur. Infection of NHP with T. cruzi can diminish their value as research models and lead to health problems and death. Identifying the modes of transmission and role of wildlife reservoirs in these facilities is therefore critical to guide interventions to reduce transmission. Here we investigated the role of roof rats (Rattus rattus), the most abundant nuisance species at a primate facility in San Antonio, in the maintenance and transmission of T. cruzi. The hearts and blood from the carcasses of the 145 rats collected underwent 2 independent PCR assays for detection of T. cruzi and other trypanosomes. The 145 hearts and 61 blood samples were all negative for T. cruzi. This population sample of 145 subjects would allow the detection of disease prevalence of 0.020 with a confidence level of 95%. The limited active vector surveillance efforts by our team combined with passive surveillance by facility personnel yielded no kissing bugs during the study period. Our results suggest that roof rats are unlikely to be important local reservoirs of T. cruzi at this facility. Further investigation of transmission dynamics across multiple years and more comprehensive vector surveillance is warranted.

"Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are among the most important vectors of arboviral diseases, worldwide. Recent studies indicate that diverse midgut microbiota of mosquitoes significantly affect development, digestion, metabolism, and immunity of their hosts. Midgut microbiota has also been suggested to modulate the competency of mosquitoes to transmit arboviruses, malaria parasites etc. Interestingly, the midgut microbial flora is dynamic and the diversity changes with the development of vectors, in addition to other factors such as species, sex, life-stage, feeding behavior and geographical origin. The aim of the present study was to investigate the midgut bacterial diversity among larva, adult male, sugar fed female and blood fed female Ae. albopictus collected from Tezpur, Northeastern India. Based on colony morphological characteristics, we selected 113 cultivable bacterial isolates for 16S rRNA gene sequence based molecular identification. Of the 113 isolates, we could identify 35 bacterial species belonging to 18 distinct genera under four major phyla, namely Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes accounted for majority (80%) of the species, while phylum Actinobacteria constituted 17% of the species. Bacteroidetes was the least represented phylum, characterized by a single species- Chryseobacterium rhizoplanae, isolated from blood fed individuals. Dissection of midgut microbiota diversity at different developmental stages of Ae. albopictus will be helpful in better understanding mosquito-borne diseases, and for designing effective strategies to manage mosquito-borne diseases.

"BACKGROUND: An unrecognized focus of tick-borne relapsing fever caused by Borrelia hermsii was identified in 2002 when five people became infected on Wild Horse Island in Flathead Lake, Montana. The terrestrial small mammal community on the island is composed primarily of pine squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), neither of which was known as a natural host for the spirochete. Thus a 3-year study was performed to identify small mammals as hosts for B. hermsii. METHODS: Small mammals were captured alive on two island and three mainland sites, blood samples were collected and examined for spirochetes, and serological tests performed to detect anti-B. hermsii antibodies. Ornithodoros hermsi ticks were collected and fed on laboratory mice to assess infection. Genomic DNA samples from spirochetes isolated from infected mammals and ticks were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS: Eighteen pine squirrels and one deer mouse had detectable spirochetemias when captured, from which 12 isolates of B. hermsii were established. Most pine squirrels were seropositive, and the five species of sciurids combined had a significantly higher prevalence of seropositive animals than did the other six small mammal species captured. The greater diversity of small mammals on the mainland in contrast to the islands demonstrated that other species in addition to pine squirrels were also involved in the maintenance of B. hermsii at Flathead Lake. Ornithodoros hermsi ticks produced an additional 12 isolates of B. hermsii and multilocus sequence typing identified both genomic groups of B. hermsii described previously, and identified a new genomic subdivision. Experimental infections of deer mice with two strains of B. hermsii demonstrated that these animals were susceptible to infection with spirochetes belonging to Genomic Group II but not Genomic Group I. CONCLUSIONS: Pine squirrels are the primary hosts for the maintenance of B. hermsii on the islands in Flathead Lake, however serological evidence showed that numerous additional species are also involved on the mainland. Future studies testing the susceptibility of several small mammal species to infection with different genetic types of B. hermsii will help define their role as hosts in this and other endemic foci.

"Virtually all multicellular organisms host a community of symbionts composed of mutualistic, commensal, and pathogenic microbes, i.e., their microbiome. The mechanism of selection on host-microbe assemblages remains contentious, particularly regarding whether selection acts differently on hosts and their microbial symbionts. Here, we attempt to reconcile these viewpoints using a model that describes how hosts and their microbial symbionts alter each other's niche and thereby fitness. We describe how host-microbe interactions might change the shape of the host niche and/or reproductive rates within it, which are directly related to host fitness. A host may also alter the niche of a symbiotic microbe, although this depends on the extent to which that microbe is dependent on the host for reproduction. Finally, we provide a mathematical model to test whether interactions between hosts and microbes are necessary to describe the niche of either partner. Our synthesis highlights the phenotypic effects of host-microbe interactions while respecting the unique lifestyles of each partner, and thereby provides a unified framework to describe how selection might act on a host that is associated with its microbiome.

"Rickettsia philipii (type strain ""Rickettsia 364D""), the etiologic agent of Pacific Coast tick fever (PCTF), is transmitted to people by the Pacific Coast tick, Dermacentor occidentalis. Following the first confirmed human case of PCTF in 2008, 13 additional human cases have been reported in California, more than half of which were pediatric cases. The most common features of PCTF are the presence of at least one necrotic lesion known as an eschar (100%), fever (85%), and headache (79%); four case-patients required hospitalization and four had multiple eschars. Findings presented here implicate the nymphal or larval stages of D. occidentalis as the primary vectors of R. philipii to people. Peak transmission risk from ticks to people occurs in late summer. Rickettsia philipii DNA was detected in D. occidentalis ticks from 15 of 37 California counties. Similarly, non-pathogenic Rickettsia rhipicephali DNA was detected in D. occidentalis in 29 of 38 counties with an average prevalence of 12.0% in adult ticks. In total, 5,601 ticks tested from 2009 through 2015 yielded an overall R. philipii infection prevalence of 2.1% in adults, 0.9% in nymphs and a minimum infection prevalence of 0.4% in larval pools. Although most human cases of PCTF have been reported from northern California, acarological surveillance suggests that R. philipii may occur throughout the distribution range of D. occidentalis.

"Hepaciviruses and pegiviruses constitute two closely related sister genera of the family Flaviviridae. In the past five years, the known phylogenetic diversity of the hepacivirus genera has absolutely exploded. What was once an isolated infection in humans (and possibly other primates) has now expanded to include horses, rodents, bats, colobus monkeys, cows, and, most recently, catsharks, shedding new light on the genetic diversity and host range of hepaciviruses. Interestingly, despite the identification of these many animal and primate hepaciviruses, the equine hepaciviruses remain the closest genetic relatives of the human hepaciviruses, providing an intriguing clue to the zoonotic source of hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes the significance of these studies and discusses current thinking about the origin and evolution of the animal hepaciviruses as well as their potential usage as surrogate models for the study of hepatitis C virus.

"In contrast to other mammalian reservoirs, many bat species migrate long-distances and have the potential to introduce exotic pathogens to new areas. Bats have long been associated with blood-borne protozoal trypanosomes of the Schizotrypanum subgenus, which includes the zoonotic parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, agent of Chagas disease. Another member of the subgenus, Trypanosoma dionisii, infects bats of Europe and South America, and genetic similarities between strains from the two continents suggest transcontinental movement of this parasite via bats. Despite the known presence of diverse trypanosomes in bats of Central and South America, and the presence of T. cruzi-infected vectors and wildlife in the US, the role of bats in maintaining and dispersing trypanosomes in the US has not yet been reported. We collected hearts and blood from 8 species of insectivorous bats from 30 counties across Texas. Using PCR and DNA sequencing, we tested 593 bats for trypanosomes and found 1 bat positive for T. cruzi (0.17%), 9 for T. dionisii (1.5%), and 5 for Blastocrithidia spp. (0.8%), a group of insect trypanosomes. The T. cruzi-infected bat was carrying TcI, the strain type associated with human disease in the US. In the T. dionisii-infected bats, we detected three unique variants associated with the three infected bat species. These findings represent the first report of T. cruzi in a bat in the US, of T. dionisii in North America, and of Blastocrithidia spp. in mammals, and underscore the importance of bats in the maintenance of trypanosomes, including agents of human and animal disease, across broad geographic locales.

"Lujo virus is a novel Old World arenavirus identified in Southern Africa in 2008 as the cause of a viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) characterized by nosocomial transmission with a high case fatality rate of 80% (4/5 cases). Whereas this outbreak was limited, the unprecedented Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa, and recent Zika virus disease epidemic in the Americas, has brought into acute focus the need for preparedness to respond to rare but potentially highly pathogenic outbreaks of zoonotic or arthropod-borne viral infections. A key determinant for effective control of a VHF outbreak is the time between primary infection and diagnosis of the index case. Here, we review the Lujo VHF outbreak of 2008 and discuss how preparatory measures with respect to developing diagnostic capacity might be effectively embedded into existing national disease control networks, such as those for human immunodeficiency virus, tuberculosis, and malaria.

"Large amounts of data and multitudes of publications have been independently generated by researchers in mammalogy and infectious diseases. The frequent confluence of these fields in epidemiological research as well as the facility of the data generated to be used in applied methods (e.g., conservation, public outreach, public health interventions) suggests that the intersection of these fields is important not only to their committed scientists but also to other areas of investigation, including public health. Given the increased frequency with which researchers in these fields interact with potentially infected humans, animals, and tissues, their occupations present a higher risk of exposure to a variety of pathogens than those in other fields of biology or among most jobs of the general public. However, a variety of methods are available for minimizing this risk, including increasing awareness of potential risks, using medical prophylaxes (when available), properly employing personal protective equipment, and using adequate disinfectants. Although instances of serious illness from zoonotic diseases among field researchers may be uncommon, they do occur; the purpose of this document is to increase awareness of risks that researchers-principal investigators and students alike-face and highlight steps and resources that can mitigate those risks.

"Relapsing fever spirochetes are tick- and louse-borne pathogens that primarily afflict those in impoverished countries. Historically the pathogens have had a significant impact on public health, yet currently they are often overlooked because of the nonspecific display of disease. In this review, we discuss aspects of relapsing fever (RF) spirochete pathogenesis including the: (1) clinical manifestation of disease; (2) ability to diagnose pathogen exposure; (3) the pathogen's life cycle in the tick and mammal; and (4) ecological factors contributing to the maintenance of RF spirochetes in nature.

"The widely-distributed North American species Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus of cricetine rodents are, between them, important natural reservoirs for several zoonotic diseases of humans: Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, babesiosis, erhlichiosis, hard tickborne relapsing fever, Powassan virus encephalitis, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, and plague. While these infections are frequently disabling and sometimes fatal for humans, the peromyscines display little pathology and apparently suffer few consequences, even when prevalence of persistent infection in a population is high. While these Peromyscus spp. are unable to clear some of the infections, they appear to have partial resistance, which limits the burden of the pathogen. In addition, they display traits of infection tolerance, which reduces the damage of the infection. Research on these complementary resistance and tolerance phenomena in Peromyscus has relevance both for disease control measures targeting natural reservoirs and for understanding the mechanisms of the comparatively greater sickness of many humans with these and other infections.

"Guidelines for use of wild mammal species in research are updated from Sikes et al. (2011) . These guidelines cover current professional techniques and regulations involving the use of mammals in research and teaching; they also incorporate new resources, procedural summaries, and reporting requirements. Included are details on capturing, marking, housing, and humanely killing wild mammals. It is recommended that Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs), regulatory agencies, and investigators use these guidelines as a resource for protocols involving wild mammals, whether studied in the field or in captivity. These guidelines were prepared and approved by the American Society of Mammalogists (ASM), in consultation with professional veterinarians experienced in wildlife research and IACUCs, whose collective expertise provides a broad and comprehensive understanding of the biology of nondomesticated mammals. The current version of these guidelines and any subsequent modifications are available online on the Animal Care and Use Committee page of the ASM website ( http://mammalogy.org/uploads/committee_files/CurrentGuidelines.pdf ). Additional resources pertaining to the use of wild animals in research are available at: http://www.mammalsociety.org/committees/animal-care-and-use#tab3 .

"Emerging and re-emerging tick-borne diseases threaten public health and the wellbeing of domestic animals and wildlife globally. The adoption of an evolutionary ecology framework aimed to diminish the impact of tick-borne diseases needs to be part of strategies to protect human and animal populations. We present a review of current knowledge on the adaptation of ticks to their environment, and the impact that global change could have on their geographic distribution in North America. Environmental pressures will affect tick population genetics by selecting genotypes able to withstand new and changing environments and by altering the connectivity and isolation of several tick populations. Research in these areas is particularly lacking in the southern United States and most of Mexico with knowledge gaps on the ecology of these diseases, including a void in the identity of reservoir hosts for several tick-borne pathogens. Additionally, the way in which anthropogenic changes to landscapes may influence tick-borne disease ecology remains to be fully understood. Enhanced knowledge in these areas is needed in order to implement effective and sustainable integrated tick management strategies. We propose to refocus ecology studies with emphasis on metacommunity-based approaches to enable a holistic perspective addressing whole pathogen and host assemblages. Network analyses could be used to develop mechanistic models involving multihost-pathogen communities. An increase in our understanding of the ecology of tick-borne diseases across their geographic distribution will aid in the design of effective area-wide tick control strategies aimed to diminish the burden of pathogens transmitted by ticks.

"Studies into the complex interaction between an organism and changes to its biotic and abiotic environment are fundamental to understanding what regulates biodiversity. These investigations occur at many phylogenetic, temporal and spatial scales and within a variety of biological and geological disciplines but often in relative isolation. This issue focuses on what can be achieved when ecological mechanisms are integrated into analyses of deep-time biodiversity patterns through the union of fossil and extant data and methods. We expand upon this perspective to argue that, given its direct relevance to the current biodiversity crisis, greater integration is needed across biodiversity research. We focus on the need to understand scaling effects, how lower-level ecological and evolutionary processes scale up and vice versa, and the importance of incorporating functional biology. Placing function at the core of biodiversity research is fundamental, as it establishes how an organism interacts with its abiotic and biotic environment and it is functional diversity that ultimately determines important ecosystem processes. To achieve full integration, concerted and ongoing efforts are needed to build a united and interactive community of biodiversity researchers, with education and interdisciplinary training at its heart.

"Baylisascaris procyonis, the raccoon roundworm, infects a wide range of vertebrate animals, including humans, in which it causes a particularly severe type of larva migrans. It is an important cause of severe neurologic disease (neural larva migrans [NLM]) but also causes ocular disease (OLM; diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis [DUSN]), visceral larva migrans (VLM), and covert/asymptomatic infections. B. procyonis is common and widespread in raccoons, and there is increasing recognition of human disease, making a clinical consideration of baylisascariasis important. This review provides an update for this disease, especially its clinical relevance and diagnosis, and summarizes the clinical cases of human NLM and VLM known to date. Most diagnosed patients have been young children less than 2 years of age, although the number of older patients diagnosed in recent years has been increasing. The recent development of recombinant antigen-based serodiagnostic assays has aided greatly in the early diagnosis of this infection. Patients recovering with fewer severe sequelae have been reported in recent years, reinforcing the current recommendation that early treatment with albendazole and corticosteroids should be initiated at the earliest suspicion of baylisascariasis. Considering the seriousness of this zoonotic infection, greater public and medical awareness is critical for the prevention and early treatment of human cases.

"Full evaluation of the interactions between a virus and host during infection and clearance requires a living organism. A live animal is also necessary for development of vaccines requiring evaluation of immunogenicity and an immune response that protects from challenge. Study of the natural host for the virus is ideal, but often not possible. Mice have emerged over the last 60 years as the most popular animal model for studying viral pathogenesis due to extensive genetic and immunologic characterization, wide availability of reagents, inbred and transgenic strains, and small size. However, responses in mice are not always predictive of those in the natural host. Other species commonly used include guinea pigs, ferrets, chickens, and nonhuman primates. When choosing an animal model for a study, factors to be considered include host susceptibility to the infection, animal size, cost, availability of housing and reagents, potential confounding coinfections, and ethical restrictions.

"Natural history collections provide an immense record of biodiversity on Earth. These repositories have traditionally been used to address fundamental questions in biogeography, systematics and conservation. However, they also hold the potential for studying evolution directly. While some of the best direct observations of evolution have come from long-term field studies or from experimental studies in the laboratory, natural history collections are providing new insights into evolutionary change in natural populations. By comparing phenotypic and genotypic changes in populations through time, natural history collections provide a window into evolutionary processes. Recent studies utilizing this approach have revealed some dramatic instances of phenotypic change over short timescales in response to presumably strong selective pressures. In some instances, evolutionary change can be paired with environmental change, providing a context for potential selective forces. Moreover, in a few cases, the genetic basis of phenotypic change is well understood, allowing for insight into adaptive change at multiple levels. These kinds of studies open the door to a wide range of previously intractable questions by enabling the study of evolution through time, analogous to experimental studies in the laboratory, but amenable to a diversity of species over longer timescales in natural populations.

"BACKGROUND: Ornithodoros turicata is a veterinary and medically important argasid tick that is recognized as a vector of the relapsing fever spirochete Borrelia turicatae and African swine fever virus. Historic collections of O. turicata have been recorded from Latin America to the southern United States. However, the geographic distribution of this vector is poorly understood in relation to environmental variables, their hosts, and consequently the pathogens they transmit. METHODOLOGY: Localities of O. turicata were generated by performing literature searches, evaluating records from the United States National Tick Collection and the Symbiota Collections of Arthropods Network, and by conducting field studies. Maximum entropy species distribution modeling (Maxent) was used to predict the current distribution of O. turicata. Vertebrate host diversity and GIS analyses of their distributions were used to ascertain the area of shared occupancy of both the hosts and vector. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results predicted previously unrecognized regions of the United States with habitat that may maintain O. turicata and could guide future surveillance efforts for a tick capable of transmitting high-consequence pathogens to human and animal populations.

"BACKGROUND: Trypanosoma cruzi, causative agent of Chagas disease in humans and dogs, is a vector-borne zoonotic protozoan parasite that can cause fatal cardiac disease. While recognized as the most economically important parasitic infection in Latin America, the incidence of Chagas disease in the United States of America (US) may be underreported and even increasing. The extensive genetic diversity of T. cruzi in Latin America is well-documented and likely influences disease progression, severity and treatment efficacy; however, little is known regarding T. cruzi strains endemic to the US. It is therefore important to expand our knowledge on US T. cruzi strains, to improve upon the recognition of and response to locally acquired infections. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: We conducted a study of T. cruzi molecular diversity in California, augmenting sparse genetic data from southern California and for the first time investigating genetic sequences from northern California. The vector Triatoma protracta was collected from southern (Escondido and Los Angeles) and northern (Vallecito) California regions. Samples were initially screened via sensitive nuclear repetitive DNA and kinetoplast minicircle DNA PCR assays, yielding an overall prevalence of approximately 28% and 55% for southern and northern California regions, respectively. Positive samples were further processed to identify discrete typing units (DTUs), revealing both TcI and TcIV lineages in southern California, but only TcI in northern California. Phylogenetic analyses (targeting COII-ND1, TR and RB19 genes) were performed on a subset of positive samples to compare Californian T. cruzi samples to strains from other US regions and Latin America. Results indicated that within the TcI DTU, California sequences were similar to those from the southeastern US, as well as to several isolates from Latin America responsible for causing Chagas disease in humans. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Triatoma protracta populations in California are frequently infected with T. cruzi. Our data extend the northern limits of the range of TcI and identify a novel genetic exchange event between TcI and TcIV. High similarity between sequences from California and specific Latin American strains indicates US strains may be equally capable of causing human disease. Additional genetic characterization of Californian and other US T. cruzi strains is recommended.

"The family Arenaviridae currently comprises over 20 viral species, each of them associated with a main rodent species as the natural reservoir and in one case possibly phyllostomid bats. Moreover, recent findings have documented a divergent group of arenaviruses in captive alethinophidian snakes. Human infections occur through mucosal exposure to aerosols or by direct contact of abraded skin with infectious materials. Arenaviruses merit interest both as highly tractable experimental model systems to study acute and persistent infections and as clinically important human pathogens including Lassa (LASV) and Junin (JUNV) viruses, the causative agents of Lassa and Argentine hemorrhagic fevers (AHFs), respectively, for which there are no FDA-licensed vaccines, and current therapy is limited to an off-label use of ribavirin (Rib) that has significant limitations. Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bi-segmented negative strand (NS) RNA genome. Each genome segment, L (ca 7.3 kb) and S (ca 3.5 kb), uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two polypeptides in opposite orientation, separated by a noncoding intergenic region (IGR). The S genomic RNA encodes the virus nucleoprotein (NP) and the precursor (GPC) of the virus surface glycoprotein that mediates virus receptor recognition and cell entry via endocytosis. The L genome RNA encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, or L polymerase) and the small (ca 11 kDa) RING finger protein Z that has functions of a bona fide matrix protein including directing virus budding. Arenaviruses were thought to be relatively stable genetically with intra- and interspecies amino acid sequence identities of 90-95 % and 44-63 %, respectively. However, recent evidence has documented extensive arenavirus genetic variability in the field. Moreover, dramatic phenotypic differences have been documented among closely related LCMV isolates. These data provide strong evidence of viral quasispecies involvement in arenavirus adaptability and pathogenesis. Here, we will review several aspects of the molecular biology of arenaviruses, phylogeny and evolution, and quasispecies dynamics of arenavirus populations for a better understanding of arenavirus pathogenesis, as well as for the development of novel antiviral strategies to combat arenavirus infections.

"Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a zoonotic obligate intracellular bacterium known to be transmitted by ticks belonging to the Ixodes persulcatus complex. This bacterium can infect several mammalian species, and is known to cause diseases with variable symptoms in many domestic animals. Specifically, it is the causative agent of tick-borne fever (TBF), a disease of important economic impact in European domestic ruminants, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), an emerging zoonotic disease in Asia, USA and Europe. A. phagocytophilum epidemiological cycles are complex and involve different ecotypes, vectors, and mammalian host species. Moreover, the epidemiology of A. phagocytophilum infection differs greatly between Europe and the USA. These different epidemiological contexts are associated with considerable variations in bacterial strains. Until recently, few A. phagocytophilum molecular typing tools were available, generating difficulties in completely elucidating the epidemiological cycles of this bacterium. Over the last few years, many A. phagocytophilum typing techniques have been developed, permitting in-depth epidemiological exploration. Here, we review the current knowledge and future perspectives regarding A. phagocytophilum epidemiology and phylogeny, and then focus on the molecular typing tools available for studying A. phagocytophilum genetic diversity.

"The gut microbiota profoundly affects the biology of its host. The composition of the microbiota is dynamic and is affected by both host genetic and many environmental effects. The gut microbiota of laboratory mice has been studied extensively, which has uncovered many of the effects that the microbiota can have. This work has also shown that the environments of different research institutions can affect the mouse microbiota. There has been relatively limited study of the microbiota of wild mice, but this has shown that it typically differs from that of laboratory mice (and that maintaining wild caught mice in the laboratory can quite quickly alter the microbiota). There is also inter-individual variation in the microbiota of wild mice, with this principally explained by geographical location. In this study we have characterised the gut (both the caecum and rectum) microbiota of wild caught Mus musculus domesticus at three UK sites and have investigated how the microbiota varies depending on host location and host characteristics. We find that the microbiota of these mice are generally consistent with those described from other wild mice. The rectal and caecal microbiotas of individual mice are generally more similar to each other, than they are to the microbiota of other individuals. We found significant differences in the diversity of the microbiotas among mice from different sample sites. There were significant correlations of microbiota diversity and body weight, a measure of age, body-mass index, serum concentration of leptin, and virus, nematode and mite infection.

"The development and evaluation of effective therapies and vaccines for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the study of its interactions with the mammalian host have been hindered for a long time by the absence of suitable small animal models. Immune compromised mouse models that recapitulate the complete HCV life cycle have been useful to investigate many aspects of the HCV life cycle including antiviral interventions. However, HCV has a high propensity to establish persistence and associated histopathological manifestations such as steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Better understanding of these processes requires the development of a permissive and fully immunocompetent small animal model. In this review we summarize the in vivo models that are available for the study of HCV.

"Rickettsiae are obligately intracellular bacteria that are transmitted to vertebrates by a variety of arthropod vectors, primarily by fleas and ticks. Once transmitted or experimentally inoculated into susceptible mammals, some rickettsiae may cause febrile illness of different morbidity and mortality, and which can manifest with different types of exhanthems in humans. However, most rickettsiae circulate in diverse sylvatic or peridomestic reservoirs without having obvious impacts on their vertebrate hosts or affecting humans. We have analyzed the key features of tick-borne maintenance of rickettsiae, which may provide a deeper basis for understanding those complex invertebrate interactions and strategies that have permitted survival and circulation of divergent rickettsiae in nature. Rickettsiae are found in association with a wide range of hard and soft ticks, which feed on very different species of large and small animals. Maintenance of rickettsiae in these vector systems is driven by both vertical and horizontal transmission strategies, but some species of Rickettsia are also known to cause detrimental effects on their arthropod vectors. Contrary to common belief, the role of vertebrate animal hosts in maintenance of rickettsiae is very incompletely understood. Some clearly play only the essential role of providing a blood meal to the tick while other hosts may supply crucial supplemental functions for effective agent transmission by the vectors. This review summarizes the importance of some recent findings with known and new vectors that afford an improved understanding of the eco-epidemiology of rickettsiae; the public health implications of that information for rickettsial diseases are also described. Special attention is paid to the co-circulation of different species and genotypes of rickettsiae within the same endemic areas and how these observations may influence, correctly or incorrectly, trends, and conclusions drawn from the surveillance of rickettsial diseases in humans.

"Although Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) are found in a great diversity of vertebrates, most studies in North America have focused on the role of mammals as spirochete reservoir hosts. We investigated the roles of birds as hosts for subadult Ixodes pacificus ticks and potential reservoirs of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) in northwestern California. Overall, 623 birds representing 53 species yielded 284 I. pacificus larvae and nymphs. We used generalized linear models and zero-inflated negative binomial models to determine associations of bird behaviors, taxonomic relationships and infestation by I. pacificus with borrelial infection in the birds. Infection status in birds was best explained by taxonomic order, number of infesting nymphs, sampling year, and log-transformed average body weight. Presence and counts of larvae and nymphs could be predicted by ground- or bark-foraging behavior and contact with dense oak woodland. Molecular analysis yielded the first reported detection of Borrelia bissettii in birds. Moreover, our data suggest that the Golden-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia atricapilla), a non-resident species, could be an important reservoir for B. burgdorferi s.s. Of 12 individual birds (9 species) that carried B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected larvae, no birds carried the same genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. in their blood as were present in the infected larvae removed from them. Possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. Our study is the first to explicitly incorporate both taxonomic relationships and behaviors as predictor variables to identify putative avian reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l. Our findings underscore the importance of bird behavior to explain local tick infestation and Borrelia infection in these animals, and suggest the potential for bird-mediated geographic spread of vector ticks and spirochetes in the far-western United States.

"Despite the widespread use of aerial baiting to manage epizootics among free-ranging populations, particularly in rabies management, bait acceptance and seroconversion rates often are lower than required to eliminate spread of disease. Our objectives in this study, therefore, were to evaluate the performance of stratified bait distribution models derived from resource selection functions (RSF) on uptake of placebo rabies baits by raccoons (Procyon lotor) and Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), as well as the probability of bait uptake as a function of proximity to bait distribution areas in fragmented agricultural ecosystems. Among 478 raccoons and 108 opossums evaluated for presence of Rhodamine B (RB) across 8 sites, only 26% of raccoons and 20% of opossums exhibited marking consistent with bait consumption 14-24 days post-baiting. The effective area treated, based on 90% kernel density estimators of marked individuals, ranged from 99-240 ha larger than bait distribution zones, with RB marked individuals captured up to 753 m beyond the bait zone. Despite incorporation of RSF data into bait distribution models, no differences in uptake rates were observed between treatment and control sites. These data likely reflect the underlying constraints imposed by the loss and fragmentation of habitat on animal movement in heterogeneous landscapes, forcing individuals to optimize movements at coarse (i.e., patch-level) rather than fine spatial scales in highly fragmented environments. Our data also confirm that the probability of bait acceptance decreases with increasing distance from bait zone interiors, even within the zone itself. Thus, although bait acceptance was confirmed beyond bait zone boundaries, the proportion of vaccinated individuals may comprise a small minority of the population at increasing distances from baiting interiors. These data suggest focal baiting creates a buffered area of treated individuals around bait zones or bait stations, but repeated treatments may be needed to achieve sufficient uptake to eradicate disease.

"Epidemiological studies worldwide have reported a high prevalence and a great diversity of Bartonella species, both in rodents and their flea parasites. The interaction among Bartonella, wild rodents, and fleas reflects a high degree of adaptation among these organisms. Vertical and horizontal efficient Bartonella transmission pathways within flea communities and from fleas to rodents have been documented in competence studies, suggesting that fleas are key players in the transmission of Bartonella to rodents. Exploration of the ecological traits of rodents and their fleas may shed light on the mechanisms used by bartonellae to become established in these organisms. The present review explores the interrelations within the Bartonella-rodent-flea system. The role of the latter two components is emphasized.

"Recent advances in sequencing technologies have greatly enhanced our abilities to identify novel microbial sequences. Thus, our understanding of the global virome and the virome of specific host species in particular is rapidly expanding. Identification of animal viruses is important for understanding animal disease, the origin and evolution of human viruses, as well as zoonotic reservoirs for emerging infections. Although the human hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), was identified 25years ago, its origin has remained elusive. In 2011, the first HCV homolog was reported in dogs but subsequent studies showed the virus to be widely distributed in horses. This indicated a wider hepacivirus host range and paved the way for identification of rodent, bat and non-human primate hepaciviruses. The equine non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV) remains the closest relative of HCV and is so far the best characterized. Identification and characterization of novel hepaciviruses may in addition lead to development of tractable animal models to study HCV persistence, immune responses and pathogenesis. This could be particular important, given the current shortage of immunocompetent models for robust HCV infection. Much remains to be learned on the novel hepaciviruses, including their association with disease, and thereby how relevant they will become as HCV model systems and for studies of animal disease. This review discusses how virome analysis led to identification of novel hepaci- and pegiviruses, their genetic relationship and characterization and the potential use of animal hepaciviruses as models to study hepaciviral infection, immunity and pathogenesis. This article forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on ""Hepatitis C: Next steps toward global eradication.""

"Eleven species of kissing bugs are found in the United States. Their home ranges may be expanding northward, perhaps as a consequence of climate change. At least eight of the species, perhaps all, are reported to harbor Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. Because humans are encroaching on kissing bug habitat, there is concern for vector-transmitted Chagas disease in the United States. To date, documented autochthonous cases of Chagas in humans in the United States are rare. Kissing bugs are capable of adapting to new habitats such as human domiciles; however, they do not colonize homes in the United States as in Central and South America. We review the biology, behavior, and medical importance of kissing bugs and the risk they pose for transmission of Chagas disease in the United States. Where possible, descriptions of US species are compared to the epidemiologically important Latin American species.

"Urbanization profoundly impacts animal populations by causing isolation, increased susceptibility to disease, and exposure to toxicants. Genetic effects include reduced effective population size, increased population substructure, and decreased adaptive potential. We investigated the influence that urbanization and a disease epizootic had on the population genetics of bobcats (Lynx rufus) distributed across a highly fragmented urban landscape. We genotyped more than 300 bobcats, sampled from 1996 to 2012, for variation at nine neutral and seven immune gene-linked microsatellite loci. We found that two freeways are significant barriers to gene flow. Further, a 3-year disease epizootic, associated with secondary anticoagulant rodenticide exposure, caused a population bottleneck that led to significant genetic differentiation between pre- and post-disease populations that was greater than that between populations separated by major freeways for >60 years. However, balancing selection acted on immune-linked loci during the epizootic, maintaining variation at functional regions. Conservation assessments need to assay loci that are potentially under selection to better preserve the adaptive potential of populations at the urban-wildland interface. Further, interconnected regions that contain appropriate habitat for wildlife will be critical to the long-term viability of animal populations in urban landscapes.

"Transboundary zoonotic diseases, several of which are vector borne, can maintain a dynamic focus and have pathogens circulating in geographic regions encircling multiple geopolitical boundaries. Global change is intensifying transboundary problems, including the spatial variation of the risk and incidence of zoonotic diseases. The complexity of these challenges can be greater in areas where rivers delineate international boundaries and encompass transitions between ecozones. The Rio Grande serves as a natural border between the US State of Texas and the Mexican States of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. Not only do millions of people live in this transboundary region, but also a substantial amount of goods and people pass through it everyday. Moreover, it occurs over a region that functions as a corridor for animal migrations, and thus links the Neotropic and Nearctic biogeographic zones, with the latter being a known foci of zoonotic diseases. However, the pathogenic landscape of important zoonotic diseases in the south Texas-Mexico transboundary region remains to be fully understood. An international perspective on the interplay between disease systems, ecosystem processes, land use, and human behaviors is applied here to analyze landscape and spatial features of Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Hantavirus disease, Lyme Borreliosis, Leptospirosis, Bartonellosis, Chagas disease, human Babesiosis, and Leishmaniasis. Surveillance systems following the One Health approach with a regional perspective will help identifying opportunities to mitigate the health burden of those diseases on human and animal populations. It is proposed that the Mexico-US border along the Rio Grande region be viewed as a continuum landscape where zoonotic pathogens circulate regardless of national borders.

"Hepatitis C virus is considered a major public health problem, infecting 2%-3% of the human population. Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models. In this review article, we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus. Finally, we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral human pathogen.

"Vector and host abundance affect infection transmission rates, prevalence, and persistence in communities. Biological diversity in hosts and vectors may provide ""rescue"" hosts which buffer against pathogen extinction and ""dilution"" hosts which reduce the force of infection in communities. Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a tick-transmitted zoonotic pathogen that circulates in small mammal and tick communities characterized by varying levels of biological diversity. We examined the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in Ixodes spp. ticks in 11 communities in northern and central California. A total of 1020 ticks of 8 species was evaluated. Five percent of ticks (5 species) were PCR-positive, with the highest prevalence (6-7%) in I. pacificus and I. ochotonae. In most species, adults had a higher prevalence than nymphs or larvae. PCR prevalence varied between 0% and 40% across sites; the infection probability in ticks increased with infestation load and prevalence in small mammals, but not tick species richness, diversity, evenness, or small mammal species richness. No particular tick species was likely to ""rescue"" infection in the community; rather the risk of A. phagocytophilum infection is related to exposure to particular tick species and life stages, and overall tick abundance.

"Most pathogens are able to infect multiple hosts but some are highly adapted to a single-host species. A detailed understanding of the basis of host specificity can provide important insights into molecular pathogenesis, the evolution of pathogenic microbes, and the potential for pathogens to cross the species barrier to infect new hosts. Comparative genomics and the development of humanized mouse models have provided important new tools with which to explore the basis of generalism and specialism. This review will examine host specificity of bacterial pathogens with a focus on generalist and specialist serovars of Salmonella enterica.

"The Arenaviridae family includes several hemorrhagic fever viruses which are important emerging pathogens. Junín virus, a member of this family, is the etiological agent of Argentine Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF). A collaboration between the Governments of Argentina and the USA rendered the attenuated Junín virus vaccine strain Candid#1. Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with genomes consisting of two single-stranded RNA species (L and S), each carrying two coding regions separated by a stably structured, non-coding intergenic region. Molecular characterization of the vaccine strain and of its more virulent ancestors, XJ13 (prototype) and XJ#44, allows a systematic approach for the discovery of key elements in virulence attenuation. We show comparisons of sequence information for the S RNA of the strains XJ13, XJ#44 and Candid#1 of Junín virus, along with other strains from the vaccine lineage and a set of Junín virus field strains collected at the AHF endemic area. Comparisons of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed different point mutations which might be linked to the attenuated phenotype. The majority of changes are consistent with a progressive attenuation of virulence between XJ13, XJ#44 and Candid#1. We propose that changes found in genomic regions with low natural variation frequencies are more likely to be associated with the virulence attenuation process. We partially sequenced field strains to analyze the genomic variability naturally occurring for Junín virus. This information, together with the sequence analysis of strains with intermediate virulence, will serve as a starting point to study the molecular bases for viral attenuation.

"Light entrains normal circadian rhythms of physiology and metabolism in all mammals. Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that spectral transmittance (color) of light passing through cages affects these responses in rats. Here, we addressed the hypothesis that red tint alters the circadian nocturnal melatonin signal and circadian oscillation of other metabolic and physiologic functions. Female nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1(rnu); n = 12 per group) were maintained on a 12:12-h light (300 lx; 123.0 μW/cm(2); lights on 0600):dark regimen in standard polycarbonate translucent clear or red-tinted cages. After 1 wk, rats underwent 6 low-volume blood draws via cardiocentesis over a 4-wk period. Plasma melatonin levels were low during the light phase (1.0 ± 0.2 pg/mL) in rats in both types of cages but were significantly lower in red-tinted (105.0 ± 2.4 pg/mL) compared with clear (154.8 ± 3.8 pg/mL) cages during the dark. Normal circadian rhythm of plasma total fatty acid was identical between groups. Although phase relationships of circadian rhythms in glucose, lactic acid, pO2, and pCO2 were identical between groups, the levels of these analytes were lower in rats in red-tinted compared with clear cages. Circadian rhythms of plasma corticosterone, insulin, and leptin were altered in terms of phasing, amplitude, and duration in rats in red-tinted compared with clear cages. These findings indicate that spectral transmittance through red-colored cages significantly affects circadian regulation of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and physiologic parameters, potentially influencing both laboratory animal health and wellbeing and scientific outcomes.

"Arenaviruses are enveloped, negative-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the family Arenaviridae. This diverse family can be further classified into OW (Old World) and NW (New World) arenaviruses based on their antigenicity, phylogeny, and geographical distribution. Many of the NW arenaviruses are highly pathogenic viruses that cause systemic human infections characterized by hemorrhagic fever and/or neurological manifestations, constituting public health problems in their endemic regions. NW arenavirus infection induces a variety of host innate immune responses, which could contribute to the viral pathogenesis and/or influence the final outcome of virus infection in vitro and in vivo. On the other hand, NW arenaviruses have also developed several strategies to counteract the host innate immune response. We will review current knowledge regarding the interplay between the host innate immune response and NW arenavirus infection in vitro and in vivo, with emphasis on viral-encoded proteins and their effect on the type I interferon response.

"The host-vector-parasite interactions in Chagas disease peridomestic transmission cycles in the United States are not yet well understood. Trypanosoma cruzi (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) infection prevalence and bloodmeal sources were determined for adult and immature triatomine (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) specimens collected from residential settings in central Texas. Sequenced cytochrome b DNA segments obtained from triatomine digestive tract identified nine vertebrate hosts and one invertebrate host in four triatomine species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma indictiva, Triatoma protracta, and Triatoma sanguisuga). The broad range of wild and domestic host species detected in triatomine specimens collected from residential sites indicates high host diversity and potential movement between the sylvatic and peridomestic settings. Domestic dogs appear to be key in the maintenance of the peridomestic transmission cycle as both a blood host for the triatomine vectors and a potential reservoir for the parasite. The high rate of T. cruzi infection among triatomine specimens that were collected from inside houses, outside houses, and dog kennels (69, 81, and 82%, respectively) suggests a current risk for Chagas disease vector-borne transmission for humans and domestic animals in residential settings in Texas because of overlap with the sylvatic cycle.

"The geographic ranges of ticks and tick-borne pathogens are changing due to global and local environmental (including climatic) changes. In this review we explore current knowledge of the drivers for changes in the ranges of ticks and tick-borne pathogen species and strains via effects on their basic reproduction number (R 0), and the mechanisms of dispersal that allow ticks and tick-borne pathogens to invade suitable environments. Using the expanding geographic distribution of the vectors and agent of Lyme disease as an example we then investigate what could be expected of the diversity of tick-borne pathogens during the process of range expansion, and compare this with what is currently being observed. Lastly we explore how historic population and range expansions and contractions could be reflected in the phylogeography of ticks and tick-borne pathogens seen in recent years, and conclude that combined study of currently changing tick and tick-borne pathogen ranges and diversity, with phylogeographic analysis, may help us better predict future patterns of invasion and diversity.

"An in vivo assay using the cytochrome P450 (P450) suicide inhibitor 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) and 24-h food intake was developed to determine the relative importance of P450s in two populations of Neotoma lepida with respect to biotransformation of plant secondary compounds in the animals' natural diets. The efficacy of ABT as a P450 inhibitor was first validated using hypnotic-state assays with and without pretreatment with ABT. Pretreatment with 100 mg/kg ABT by gavage increased hexobarbital sleep times 3-4-fold in both populations, showing effective inhibition of P450s in woodrats. Next, the Great Basin population was fed a terpene-rich juniper diet, and the Mojave population was fed a phenolic-rich creosote diet, with rabbit chow serving as the control diet in each group. Treatment with ABT inhibited food intake in the Great Basin population fed the juniper diet to a greater extent (35%) than the Great Basin population fed the control diet (19%) or the Mojave population fed the creosote diet (16%). The food intake of the Mojave population fed the control diet was not significantly inhibited by ABT. The findings suggest that the biotransformation of terpenes in juniper relies more heavily on P450s than that of phenolics in creosote. This assay provides an inexpensive and noninvasive method to explore the relative importance of P450s in the biotransformation strategies of wild mammalian herbivores.

"This review examines parasite zoonoses and wildlife in the context of the One Health triad that encompasses humans, domestic animals, wildlife and the changing ecosystems in which they live. Human (anthropogenic) activities influence the flow of all parasite infections within the One Health triad and the nature and impact of resulting spillover events are examined. Examples of spillover from wildlife to humans and/or domestic animals, and vice versa, are discussed, as well as emerging issues, particularly the need for parasite surveillance of wildlife populations. Emphasis is given to Trypanosoma cruzi and related species in Australian wildlife, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Giardia, Baylisascaris, Toxoplasma and Leishmania.

"Human demands on natural resources result in landscape changes that facilitate the emergence of disease. Most emerging diseases are zoonotic, and some of these pathogens play a role in the decline of vulnerable wildlife species. Baylisascaris procyonis, the common roundworm parasite of raccoons (Procyon lotor), is a well recognized zoonotic infection that has many of the properties associated with a pathogen capable of driving extinction. It is highly non-specific and frequently pathogenic with regard to paratenic hosts, which contact eggs of B. procyonis at raccoon latrines. Eggs accumulate at latrines and remain viable for many years. Transmission of B. procyonis is sensitive to changes in land-use, and fragmented habitats increase contact rates between raccoons, potential paratenic hosts, and the parasite. Raccoons, and subsequently B. procyonis, have been introduced to Europe and Japan, where naïve vertebrates may be exposed to the parasite. Finally, domestic animals and exotic pets can carry patent infections with B. procyonis, thus increasing environmental contamination beyond raccoon latrines, and expanding the area of risk to potential paratenic hosts. This parasite can potentially contribute to extinctions of vulnerable species, as exemplified by the case of the Allegheny woodrat (Neotoma magister), a species that has experienced local declines and extinctions that are linked to B. procyonis. Conservation strategies for vulnerable species should consider the transmission ecology of parasitic pathogens, like B. procyonis.

"Wildlife, especially mammals and birds, are hosts to an enormous number of viruses, most of which we have absolutely no knowledge about even though we know these viruses circulate readily in their specific niches. More often than not, these viruses are silent or asymptomatic in their natural hosts. In some instances, they can infect other species, and in rare cases, this cross-species transmission might lead to human infection. There are also instances where we know the reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses that can and do infect humans. Studies of these animal hosts, the reservoirs of the viruses, provide us with the knowledge of the types of virus circulating in wildlife species, their incidence, pathogenicity for their host, and in some instances, the potential for transmission to other hosts. This paper describes examples of some of the viruses that have been detected in wildlife, and the reservoir hosts from which they have been detected. It also briefly explores the spread of arthropod-borne viruses and their diseases through the movement and establishment of vectors in new habitats.

"United States national parks attract > 275 million visitors annually and collectively present risk of exposure for staff and visitors to a wide range of arthropod vector species (most notably fleas, mosquitoes, and ticks) and their associated bacterial, protozoan, or viral pathogens. We assessed the current state of knowledge for risk of exposure to vector-borne pathogens in national parks through a review of relevant literature, including internal National Park Service documents and organismal databases. We conclude that, because of lack of systematic surveillance for vector-borne pathogens in national parks, the risk of pathogen exposure for staff and visitors is unclear. Existing data for vectors within national parks were not based on systematic collections and rarely include evaluation for pathogen infection. Extrapolation of human-based surveillance data from neighboring communities likely provides inaccurate estimates for national parks because landscape differences impact transmission of vector-borne pathogens and human-vector contact rates likely differ inside versus outside the parks because of differences in activities or behaviors. Vector-based pathogen surveillance holds promise to define when and where within national parks the risk of exposure to infected vectors is elevated. A pilot effort, including 5-10 strategic national parks, would greatly improve our understanding of the scope and magnitude of vector-borne pathogen transmission in these high-use public settings. Such efforts also will support messaging to promote personal protection measures and inform park visitors and staff of their responsibility for personal protection, which the National Park Service preservation mission dictates as the core strategy to reduce exposure to vector-borne pathogens in national parks.

"Comparative analysis of ospC genes from 127 Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strains collected in European and North American regions where Lyme disease is endemic and where it is not endemic revealed a close relatedness of geographically distinct populations. ospC alleles A, B, and L were detected on both continents in vectors and hosts, including humans. Six ospC alleles, A, B, L, Q, R, and V, were prevalent in Europe; 4 of them were detected in samples of human origin. Ten ospC alleles, A, B, D, E3, F, G, H, H3, I3, and M, were identified in the far-western United States. Four ospC alleles, B, G, H, and L, were abundant in the southeastern United States. Here we present the first expanded analysis of ospC alleles of B. burgdorferi strains from the southeastern United States with respect to their relatedness to strains from other North American and European localities. We demonstrate that ospC genotypes commonly associated with human Lyme disease in European and North American regions where the disease is endemic were detected in B. burgdorferi strains isolated from the non-human-biting tick Ixodes affinis and rodent hosts in the southeastern United States. We discovered that some ospC alleles previously known only from Europe are widely distributed in the southeastern United States, a finding that confirms the hypothesis of transoceanic migration of Borrelia species.

"The Arenaviridae is a diverse and growing family of viruses that includes several agents responsible for important human diseases. Despite the importance of this family for public health, particularly in Africa and South America, much of its biology remains poorly understood. However, in recent years significant progress has been made in this regard, particularly relating to the formation and release of new enveloped virions, which is an essential step in the viral lifecycle. While this process is mediated chiefly by the viral matrix protein Z, recent evidence suggests that for some viruses the nucleoprotein (NP) is also required to enhance the budding process. Here we highlight and compare the distinct budding mechanisms of different arenaviruses, concentrating on the role of the matrix protein Z, its known late domain sequences, and the involvement of cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway components. Finally we address the recently described roles for the nucleoprotein NP in budding and ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) incorporation, as well as discussing possible mechanisms related to its involvement.

"Hosts species for multi-host pathogens show considerable variation in the species' reservoir competence, which is usually used to measure species' potential to maintain and transmit these pathogens. Although accumulating research has proposed a trade-off between life-history strategies and immune defences, only a few studies extended this to host species' reservoir competence. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we studied the relationships between some species' life-history traits and reservoir competence in three emerging infectious vector-borne disease systems, namely Lyme disease, West Nile Encephalitis (WNE) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE). The results showed that interspecific variation in reservoir competence could be partly explained by the species' life histories. Species with larger body mass (for hosts of Lyme disease and WNE) or smaller clutch size (for hosts of EEE) had a lower reservoir competence [corrected]. Given that both larger body mass and smaller clutch size were linked to higher extinction risk of local populations, our study suggests that with decreasing biodiversity, species with a higher reservoir competence are more likely to remain in the community, and thereby increase the risk of transmitting these pathogens, which might be a possible mechanism underlying the dilution effect.

"Arenavirus particles are enveloped and contain two single-strand RNA genomic segments with ambisense coding. Genetic plasticity of the arenaviruses comes from transcription errors, segment reassortment, and permissive genomic packaging, and results in their remarkable ability, as a group, to infect a wide variety of hosts. In this review, we discuss some in vitro studies of virus genetic and phenotypic variation after exposure to selective pressures such as high viral dose, mutagens and antivirals. Additionally, we discuss the variation in vivo of selected isolates of Old World arenaviruses, particularly after infection of different animal species. We also discuss the recent emergence of new arenaviruses in the context of our observations of sequence variations that appear to be host-specific.

"The opportunity to reflect broadly on the accomplishments, prospects, and reach of a field may present itself relatively infrequently. Each biennial meeting of the International Biogeography Society showcases ideas solicited and developed largely during the preceding year, by individuals or teams from across the breadth of the discipline. Here, we highlight challenges, developments, and opportunities in biogeography from that biennial synthesis. We note the realized and potential impact of rapid data accumulation in several fields, a renaissance for inter-disciplinary research, the importance of recognizing the evolution-ecology continuum across spatial and temporal scales and at different taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional levels, and re-exploration of classical assumptions and hypotheses using new tools. However, advances are taxonomically and geographically biased, and key theoretical frameworks await tools to handle, or strategies to simplify, the biological complexity seen in empirical systems. Current threats to biodiversity require unprecedented integration of knowledge and development of predictive capacity that may enable biogeography to unite its descriptive and hypothetico-deductive branches and establish a greater role within and outside academia.

"Over 77 million dogs and 93 million cats share our households in the United States. Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of pets in their owners' physical and mental health. Given the large number of companion animals in the United States and the proximity and bond of these animals with their owners, understanding and preventing the diseases that these companions bring with them are of paramount importance. Zoonotic protozoal parasites, including toxoplasmosis, Chagas' disease, babesiosis, giardiasis, and leishmaniasis, can cause insidious infections, with asymptomatic animals being capable of transmitting disease. Giardia and Toxoplasma gondii, endemic to the United States, have high prevalences in companion animals. Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi are found regionally within the United States. These diseases have lower prevalences but are significant sources of human disease globally and are expanding their companion animal distribution. Thankfully, healthy individuals in the United States are protected by intact immune systems and bolstered by good nutrition, sanitation, and hygiene. Immunocompromised individuals, including the growing number of obese and/or diabetic people, are at a much higher risk of developing zoonoses. Awareness of these often neglected diseases in all health communities is important for protecting pets and owners. To provide this awareness, this review is focused on zoonotic protozoal mechanisms of virulence, epidemiology, and the transmission of pathogens of consequence to pet owners in the United States.

"Recently, an undescribed Anaplasma sp. (also called Ehrlichia-like sp. or WTD agent) was isolated in ISE6 tick cells from captive white-tailed deer. The goal of the current study was to characterize this organism using a combination of experimental infection, morphologic, serologic, and molecular studies. Each of 6 experimentally inoculated white-tailed deer fawns (Odocoileus virginianus) became chronically infected (100+ days) with the Anaplasma sp. by inoculation of either infected whole blood or culture. None of the deer showed evidence of clinical disease, but 3 of the 6 deer evaluated had multiple episodes of transient thrombocytopenia. Light microscopy of Giemsa-stained, thin blood smears revealed tiny, dark, spherical structures in platelets of acutely infected deer. Anaplasma sp. was detected in platelets of inoculated deer by polymerase chain reaction, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization. Five of 6 deer developed antibodies reactive to Anaplasma sp. antigen, as detected by indirect fluorescent antibody testing. Phylogenetic analyses of 16S rRNA, groESL, and gltA sequences confirmed the Anaplasma sp. is related to A. platys. Two attempts to transmit the Anaplasma sp. between deer by feeding Amblyomma americanum, a suspected tick vector, were unsuccessful. Based on its biologic, antigenic, and genetic characteristics, this organism is considered a novel species of Anaplasma, and the name Anaplasma odocoilei sp. nov. is proposed with UMUM76(T) (=CSUR-A1) as the type strain.

"The family Arenaviridae, genus Arenavirus, consists of two phylogenetically independent groups: Old World (OW) and New World (NW) complexes. The Lassa and Lujo viruses in the OW complex and the Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and Chapare viruses in the NW complex cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans, leading to serious public health concerns. These viruses are also considered potential bioterrorism agents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect these pathogens rapidly and specifically in order to minimize the risk and scale of arenavirus outbreaks. However, these arenaviruses are classified as BSL-4 pathogens, thus making it difficult to develop diagnostic techniques for these virus infections in institutes without BSL-4 facilities. To overcome these difficulties, antibody detection systems in the form of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescence assay were developed using recombinant nucleoproteins (rNPs) derived from these viruses. Furthermore, several antigen-detection assays were developed. For example, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the rNPs of Lassa and Junin viruses were generated. Sandwich antigen-capture (Ag-capture) ELISAs using these mAbs as capture antibodies were developed and confirmed to be sensitive and specific for detecting the respective arenavirus NPs. These rNP-based assays were proposed to be useful not only for an etiological diagnosis of VHFs, but also for seroepidemiological studies on VHFs. We recently developed arenavirus neutralization assays using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based pseudotypes bearing arenavirus recombinant glycoproteins. The goal of this article is to review the recent advances in developing laboratory diagnostic assays based on recombinant viral proteins for the diagnosis of VHFs and epidemiological studies on the VHFs caused by&nbsp;arenaviruses.

"Lassa virus, an Old World arenavirus (family Arenaviridae), is the etiological agent of Lassa fever, a severe human disease that is reported in more than 100,000 patients annually in the endemic regions of West Africa with mortality rates for hospitalized patients varying between 5-10%. Currently, there are no approved vaccines against Lassa fever for use in humans. Here, we review the published literature on the life cycle of Lassa virus with the specific focus put on Lassa fever pathogenesis in humans and relevant animal models. Advancing knowledge significantly improves our understanding of Lassa virus biology, as well as of the mechanisms that allow the virus to evade the host's immune system. However, further investigations are required in order to design improved diagnostic tools, an effective vaccine, and therapeutic agents.

"Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an obligately intracellular, tick-transmitted, bacterial pathogen of humans and other animals. In order to evade host immunity during the course of infection, A. phagocytophilum utilizes gene conversion to shuffle approximately 100 functional pseudogenes into a single expression cassette of the msp2(p44) gene, which encodes the major surface antigen, major surface protein 2 (Msp2). The role and extent of msp2(p44) recombination in a reservoir host for A. phagocytophilum have not been evaluated. In the current study, we explored patterns of recombination and expression site variability of the msp2(p44) gene in three chronically infected woodrats, a reservoir for the disease in the Western USA. All three woodrats developed persistent infection of at least 6 months duration; two of them maintained active infection for at least 8 months. In total, we detected the emergence of 60 unique msp2(p44) expression site variants with no common temporal patterns of expression site recombination among the three A. phagocytophilum populations. Both the strength of infection (i.e. pathogen load) and the genetic diversity of pseudogenes detected at the msp2(p44) expression site fluctuated periodically during the course of infection. An analysis of the genomic pseudogene exhaustion rate showed that the repertoire of pseudogenes available to the A. phagocytophilum population could in theory become depleted within a year. However, the apparent emergence of variant pseudogenes suggests that the pathogen could potentially evade host immunity indefinitely. Our findings suggest a tightly co-evolved relationship between A. phagocytophilum and woodrats in which the pathogen perpetually evades host immunity yet causes no detectable disease.

"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) pose a significant threat to human health, economic stability, and biodiversity. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying disease emergence are still not fully understood, and control measures rely heavily on mitigating the impact of EIDs after they have emerged. Here, we highlight the emergence of a zoonotic Henipavirus, Nipah virus, to demonstrate the interdisciplinary and macroecological approaches necessary to understand EID emergence. Previous work suggests that Nipah virus emerged due to the interaction of the wildlife reservoir (Pteropus spp. fruit bats) with intensively managed livestock. The emergence of this and other henipaviruses involves interactions among a suite of anthropogenic environmental changes, socioeconomic factors, and changes in demography that overlay and interact with the distribution of these pathogens in their wildlife reservoirs. Here, we demonstrate how ecological niche modeling may be used to investigate the potential role of a changing climate on the future risk for Henipavirus emergence. We show that the distribution of Henipavirus reservoirs, and therefore henipaviruses, will likely change under climate change scenarios, a fundamental precondition for disease emergence in humans. We assess the variation among climate models to estimate where Henipavirus host distribution is most likely to expand, contract, or remain stable, presenting new risks for human health. We conclude that there is substantial potential to use this modeling framework to explore the distribution of wildlife hosts under a changing climate. These approaches may directly inform current and future management and surveillance strategies aiming to improve pathogen detection and, ultimately, reduce emergence risk.

"West Nile virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, WNV) is now endemic in California across a variety of ecological regions that support a wide diversity of potential avian and mammalian host species. Because different avian hosts have varying competence for WNV, determining the blood-feeding patterns of Culex (Diptera: Culicidae) vectors is a key component in understanding the maintenance and amplification of the virus as well as tangential transmission to humans and horses. We investigated the blood-feeding patterns of Culex tarsalis Coquillett and members of the Culex pipiens L. complex from southern to northern California. Nearly 100 different host species were identified from 1,487 bloodmeals, by using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase I (COI). Cx. tarsalis fed on a higher diversity of hosts and more frequently on nonhuman mammals than did the Cx. pipiens complex. Several WNV-competent host species, including house finch and house sparrow, were common bloodmeal sources for both vector species across several biomes and could account for WNV maintenance and amplification in these areas. Highly competent American crow, western scrub-jay and yellow-billed magpie also were fed upon often when available and are likely important as amplifying hosts for WNV in some areas. Neither species fed frequently on humans (Cx. pipiens complex [0.4%], Cx. tarsalis [0.2%]), but with high abundance, both species could serve as both enzootic and bridge vectors for WNV.

"Brucellosis is one of the major bacterial zoonoses worldwide. In the past decade, an increasing number of atypical Brucella strains and species have been described. Brucella microti in particular has attracted attention, because this species not only infects mammalian hosts but also persists in soil. An environmental reservoir may pose a new public health risk, leading to the reemergence of brucellosis. In a polyphasic approach, comprising conventional microbiological techniques and extensive biochemical and molecular techniques, all currently available Brucella microti strains were characterized. While differing in their natural habitats and host preferences, B. microti isolates were found to possess identical 16S rRNA, recA, omp2a, and omp2b gene sequences and identical multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) profiles at 21 different genomic loci. Only highly variable microsatellite markers of multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) analysis comprising 16 loci (MLVA-16) showed intraspecies discriminatory power. In contrast, biotyping demonstrated striking differences within the genetically homologous species. The majority of the mammalian isolates agglutinated only with monospecific anti-M serum, whereas soil isolates agglutinated with anti-A, anti-M, and anti-R sera. Bacteria isolated from animal sources were lysed by phages F1, F25, Tb, BK2, Iz, and Wb, whereas soil isolates usually were not. Rough strains of environmental origin were lysed only by phage R/C. B. microti exhibited high metabolic activities similar to those of closely related soil organisms, such as Ochrobactrum spp. Each strain was tested with 93 different substrates and showed an individual metabolic profile. In summary, the adaptation of Brucella microti to a specific habitat or host seems to be a matter of gene regulation rather than a matter of gene configuration.

"BACKGROUND: Despite the advances in the diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis, it is still considered as a severe public health problem particularly in developing countries and a great economic burden on the health resources. The present study was designed and conducted to determine the eco-environmental characteristics of the leishmaniasis disease by spatial analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an ecological study, data were collected on eco-environmental factors of Fars province in Iran and on cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) cases from 2002 to 2009. geographic weighted regression (GWR) was used to analyse the data and compare them with ordinary least square (OLS) regression model results. Moran's Index was applied for analysis of spatial autocorrelation in residual of OLS. P value less than 0.05 was considered as significant and adjusted R(2) was used for model preferences. RESULTS: There was a significant spatial autocorrelation in the residuals of OLS model (Z=2.45, P=0.014). GWR showed that rainy days, minimum temperature, wind velocity, maximum relative humidity and population density were the most important eco-environmental risk factors and explained 0.388 of the associated factors of CL. CONCLUSION: Spatial analysis can be a good tool for detection and prediction of CL disease. In autocorrelated and non-stationary data, GWR model yields a better fitness than OLS regression model. Also, population density can be used as a surrogate variable of acquired immunity and increase the adjusted R(2).

"The purpose of this study was to extend our knowledge of the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among the North American Tacaribe serocomplex viruses. Analyses of glycoprotein precursor gene sequence data separated the North American arenaviruses into 7 major phylogenetic groups. The results of analyses of Z gene and nucleocapsid protein gene sequence data were not remarkably different from the glycoprotein precursor gene tree. In contrast, the tree generated from RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene sequences differed from the glycoprotein precursor gene tree with regard to phylogenetic relationships among the viruses associated with woodrats captured in the western United States, Texas, or northern Mexico. Further analyses of the polymerase gene sequence data set suggested that the difference in topology was a consequence of incongruence among the gene tree data sets or chance rather than genetic reassortment or recombination between arenaviruses.

"Chagas' disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and causes potentially life-threatening disease of the heart and gastrointestinal tract. The southern half of the United States contains enzootic cycles of T. cruzi, involving 11 recognized triatomine vector species. The greatest vector diversity and density occur in the western United States, where woodrats are the most common reservoir; other rodents, raccoons, skunks, and coyotes are also infected with T. cruzi. In the eastern United States, the prevalence of T. cruzi is highest in raccoons, opossums, armadillos, and skunks. A total of 7 autochthonous vector-borne human infections have been reported in Texas, California, Tennessee, and Louisiana; many others are thought to go unrecognized. Nevertheless, most T. cruzi-infected individuals in the United States are immigrants from areas of endemicity in Latin America. Seven transfusion-associated and 6 organ donor-derived T. cruzi infections have been documented in the United States and Canada. As improved control of vector- and blood-borne T. cruzi transmission decreases the burden in countries where the disease is historically endemic and imported Chagas' disease is increasingly recognized outside Latin America, the United States can play an important role in addressing the altered epidemiology of Chagas' disease in the 21st century.

"The definition of a zoonosis is that it must affect man but the term is used often outside of medical terminology of animal diseases where man is not involved. Zoonoses are diseases naturally transmitted between animals and man and comprise in total about 80% of all described human infections. Attempts have been made to define different classes of zoonoses according to the man-animal relationship but generally this does not seem to have been accepted. Elton in 1927 stressed the field of wild animal pathology was still virtually untouched, and in 1968 McDiarmid reiterated the view that it remained one of the most neglected aspects of animal ecology. There is now an extensive literature but it is rarely incorporated into ecological texts although disease is often the driving force in population dynamics. The primary driver of infectious disease dynamics is transmission between individuals, yet in most important respects remarkably little is known about the subject (Craft et al. 2008, Haydon 2008). Occasionally, under high population densities, an organism may infect a host outside of its normal range with highly pathogenic effect in its adventitious host.

"Arenaviruses such as Lassa fever virus (LASV) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are benign in their natural reservoir hosts, and can occasionally cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in non-human primates and in human beings. LCMV is considerably more benign for human beings than Lassa virus, however certain strains, like the LCMV-WE strain, can cause severe disease when the virus is delivered as a high-dose inoculum. Here we describe a rhesus macaque model for Lassa fever that employs a virulent strain of LCMV. Since LASV must be studied within Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) facilities, the LCMV-infected macaque model has the advantage that it can be used at BSL-3. LCMV-induced disease is rarely as severe as other VHF, but it is similar in cases where vascular leakage leads to lethal systemic failure. The LCMV-infected macaque has been valuable for describing the course of disease with differing viral strains, doses and routes of infection. By monitoring system-wide changes in physiology and gene expression in a controlled experimental setting, it is possible to identify events that are pathognomonic for developing VHF and potential treatment targets.

"Humans inhabit a remarkably diverse range of environments, and adaptation through natural selection has likely played a central role in the capacity to survive and thrive in extreme climates. Unlike numerous studies that used only population genetic data to search for evidence of selection, here we scan the human genome for selection signals by identifying the SNPs with the strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate across 61 worldwide populations. We find a striking enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those that are strongly correlated with these climate variables. Among the most extreme signals, several overlap with those from GWAS, including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. Further, we find an enrichment of strong signals in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection and immunity, and cancer. Our results imply that adaptations to climate shaped the spatial distribution of variation in humans.

"BACKGROUND: Dogs are the predominant domestic reservoir for human L. infantum infection. Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) is an emerging problem in some U.S. dog breeds, with an annual quantitative PCR prevalence of greater than 20% within an at-risk Foxhound population. Although classically Leishmania is transmitted by infected sand flies and phlebotomine sand flies exist in the United States, means of ongoing L. infantum transmission in U.S. dogs is currently unknown. Possibilities include vertical (transplacental/transmammary) and horizontal/venereal transmission. Several reports have indicated that endemic ZVL may be transmitted vertically. AIMS: Our aims for this present study were to establish whether vertical/transplacental transmission was occurring in this population of Leishmania-infected US dogs and determine the effect that this means of transmission has on immune recognition of Leishmania. METHODOLOGY: A pregnant L. infantum-infected dam donated to Iowa State University gave birth in-house to 12 pups. Eight pups humanely euthanized at the time of birth and four pups and the dam humanely euthanized three months post-partum were studied via L. infantum-kinetoplast specific quantitative PCR (kqPCR), gross and histopathological assessment and CD4+ T cell proliferation assay. KEY RESULTS: This novel report describes disseminated L. infantum parasites as identified by kqPCR in 8 day old pups born to a naturally-infected, seropositive U.S. dog with no travel history. This is the first report of vertical transmission of L. infantum in naturally-infected dogs in North America, emphasizing that this novel means of transmission could possibly sustain infection within populations. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS: Evidence that vertical transmission of ZVL may be a driving force for ongoing disease in an otherwise non-endemic region has significant implications on current control strategies for ZVL, as at present parasite elimination efforts in endemic areas are largely focused on vector-borne transmission between canines and people. Determining frequency of vertical transmission and incorporating canine sterilization with vector control may have a more significant impact on ZVL transmission to people in endemic areas than current control efforts.

"Zootherapy is the treatment of human ailments with remedies made from animals and their products. Despite its prevalence in traditional medical practices worldwide, research on this phenomenon has often been neglected in comparison to medicinal plant research. This review discusses some related aspects of the use of animal-based remedies in Latin America, identifies those species used as folk remedies, and discusses the implications of zootherapy for public health and biological conservation. The review of literature revealed that at least 584 animal species, distributed in 13 taxonomic categories, have been used in traditional medicine in region. The number of medicinal species catalogued was quite expansive and demonstrates the importance of zootherapy as an alternative mode of therapy in Latin America. Nevertheless, this number is certainly underestimated since the number of studies on the theme are very limited. Animals provide the raw materials for remedies prescribed clinically and are also used in the form of amulets and charms in magic-religious rituals and ceremonies. Zootherapeutic resources were used to treat different diseases. The medicinal fauna is largely based on wild animals, including some endangered species. Besides being influenced by cultural aspects, the relations between humans and biodiversity in the form of zootherapeutic practices are conditioned by the social and economic relations between humans themselves. Further ethnopharmacological studies are necessary to increase our understanding of the links between traditional uses of faunistic resources and conservation biology, public health policies, sustainable management of natural resources and bio-prospecting.

"The distribution of vector meals in the host community is an important element of understanding and predicting vector-borne disease risk. Lizards (such as the western fence lizard; Sceloporus occidentalis) play a unique role in Lyme disease ecology in the far-western United States. Lizards rather than mammals serve as the blood meal hosts for a large fraction of larval and nymphal western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus--the vector for Lyme disease in that region) but are not competent reservoirs for the pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi. Prior studies have suggested that the net effect of lizards is to reduce risk of human exposure to Lyme disease, a hypothesis that we tested experimentally. Following experimental removal of lizards, we documented incomplete host switching by larval ticks (5.19%) from lizards to other hosts. Larval tick burdens increased on woodrats, a competent reservoir, but not on deer mice, a less competent pathogen reservoir. However, most larvae failed to find an alternate host. This resulted in significantly lower densities of nymphal ticks the following year. Unexpectedly, the removal of reservoir-incompetent lizards did not cause an increase in nymphal tick infection prevalence. The net result of lizard removal was a decrease in the density of infected nymphal ticks, and therefore a decreased risk to humans of Lyme disease. Our results indicate that an incompetent reservoir for a pathogen may, in fact, increase disease risk through the maintenance of higher vector density and therefore, higher density of infected vectors.

"Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have a crucial role in the immune response of vertebrates, alter the individual odour and are involved in shaping mating preferences. Pathogen-mediated selection, sexual selection and maternal-fetal interactions have been proposed as the main drivers of frequently observed high levels of polymorphism in functionally important parts of the MHC. Bats constitute the second largest mammalian order and have recently emerged as important vectors of infectious diseases. In addition, Chiroptera are interesting study subjects in evolutionary ecology in the context of olfactory communication, mate choice and associated fitness benefits. Thus, it is surprising that they belong to the least studied mammalian taxa in terms of their MHC diversity. In this study, we investigated the variability in the functionally important MHC class II gene DRB, evidence for selection and population structure in the group-living lesser bulldog bat, Noctilio albiventris, in Panama. We found a single expressed, polymorphic Noal-DRB gene. The substitution pattern of the nucleotide sequences of the 18 detected alleles provided evidence for positive selection acting above the evolutionary history of the species in shaping MHC diversity. Roosting colonies were not genetically differentiated but females showed lower levels of heterozygosity than males, which might be a sign that the sexes differ in the selection pressures acting on the MHC. This study provides the prerequisites for further investigations of the role of the individual MHC constitution in parasite resistance, olfactory communication and mate choice in N. albiventris and other bats.

"Southern California remains an important focus of West Nile virus (WNV) activity, with persistently elevated incidence after invasion by the virus in 2003 and subsequent amplification to epidemic levels in 2004. Eco-epidemiological studies of vectors-hosts-pathogen interactions are of paramount importance for better understanding of the transmission dynamics of WNV and other emerging mosquito-borne arboviruses. We investigated vector-host interactions and host-feeding patterns of 531 blood-engorged mosquitoes in four competent mosquito vectors by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method targeting mitochondrial DNA to identify vertebrate hosts of blood-fed mosquitoes. Diagnostic testing by cell culture, real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR, and immunoassays were used to examine WNV infection in blood-fed mosquitoes, mosquito pools, dead birds, and mammals. Prevalence of WNV antibodies among wild birds was estimated by using a blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analyses of engorged Culex quinquefasciatus revealed that this mosquito species acquired 88.4% of the blood meals from avian and 11.6% from mammalian hosts, including humans. Similarly, Culex tarsalis fed 82% on birds and 18% on mammals. Culex erythrothorax fed on both birds (59%) and mammals (41%). In contrast, Culex stigmatosoma acquired all blood meals from avian hosts. House finches and a few other mostly passeriform birds served as the main hosts for the blood-seeking mosquitoes. Evidence of WNV infection was detected in mosquito pools, wild birds, dead birds, and mammals, including human fatalities during the study period. Our results emphasize the important role of house finches and several other passeriform birds in the maintenance and amplification of WNV in southern California, with Cx. quinquefasciatus acting as both the principal enzootic and ""bridge vector"" responsible for the spillover of WNV to humans. Other mosquito species, such as Cx. tarsalis and Cx. stigmatosoma, are important but less widely distributed, and also contribute to spatial and temporal transmission of WNV in southern California.

"In The Origin of Species, Darwin proposed his principle of divergence of character (a process now termed ""character displacement"") to explain how new species arise and why they differ from each other phenotypically. Darwin maintained that the origin of species and the evolution of differences between them is ultimately caused by divergent selection acting to minimize competitive interactions between initially similar individuals, populations, and species. Here, we examine the empirical support for the various claims that constitute Darwin's principle, specifically that (1) competition promotes divergent trait evolution, (2) the strength of competitively mediated divergent selection increases with increasing phenotypic similarity between competitors, (3) divergence can occur within species, and (4) competitively mediated divergence can trigger speciation. We also explore aspects that Darwin failed to consider. In particular, we describe how (1) divergence can arise from selection acting to lessen reproductive interactions, (2) divergence is fueled by the intersection of character displacement and sexual selection, and (3) phenotypic plasticity may play a key role in promoting character displacement. Generally, character displacement is well supported empirically, and it remains a vital explanation for how new species arise and diversify.

"Previous studies revealed that the Pacific Coast tick (Dermacentor occidentalis) is infected occasionally with the agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) or human granulocytic anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum) and that it is an inefficient experimental vector of B. burgdorferi. The relationship of the pajahuello tick (Ornithodoros coriaceus) to each of these bacterial zoonotic agents has not been reported. The primary bridging vector of both bacterial zoonotic agents to humans is the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus). Because of the spatial and temporal overlap of D. occidentalis and O. coriaceus populations with those of I. pacificus in natural foci of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in northwestern California, we conducted field and laboratory studies to determine if the Pacific Coast tick or the pajahuello tick potentially may serve as secondary vectors of either bacterium. Our findings reconfirmed that wild-caught D. occidentalis ticks are infected infrequently with B. burgdorferi or A. phagocytophilum, but some adult ticks from dense woodlands or chaparral were found to contain 2 important veterinary pathogens for the first time (Anaplasma bovis, A. ovis). The high prevalence of A. bovis infection (4.3%, n=185 ticks) within chaparral-derived ticks suggests that D. occidentalis could be an efficient vector of this rickettsia. Experimental attempts to transmit borreliae or Anaplasma spp. that may have been present in >100 wild-caught D. occidentalis adults to naïve rabbits were unsuccessful. Anaplasma spp. were not detected in O. coriaceus, but one (4.3%) of 23 nymphs was infected with B. bissettii. This finding and an antecedent report of a B. burgdorferi-like spirochete from the same tick species demonstrate that O. coriaceus sometimes acquires and transstadially passes Lyme disease group spirochetes. I. pacificus nymphs inhabiting a woodland nidus of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum had a 5-fold higher prevalence of borreliae than adult ticks from the same generational cohort. In contrast to the results of preceding studies carried out at the same site, none of the nymphal or adult ticks was PCR-positive for A. phagocytophilum. This suggests that the distribution of this rickettsia is highly focal or variable from year-to-year within this particular woodland.

"Human brucellosis, a zoonotic disease of major public health concern in several developing countries, is primarily caused by Brucella abortus, Brucella melitensis, and Brucella suis. No brucellosis vaccine is available for human use. The aim of this study was to determine if Brucella neotomae, a bacterium not known to cause disease in any host, can be used for developing brucellosis vaccines. B. neotomae and its recombinant strains overexpressing superoxide dismutase and a 26 kDa periplasmic protein were rendered non-replicative through exposure to gamma-radiation and used as vaccines in a murine brucellosis model. All three vaccines induced antigen-specific antibody and T cell responses. The vaccinated mice showed significant resistance against challenge with virulent B. abortus 2308, B. melitensis 16 M, and B. suis 1330. These results demonstrate that the avirulent B. neotomae is a promising platform for developing a safe and effective vaccine for human brucellosis.

"Invasive species, including pathogens, can have important effects on local ecosystems, including indirect consequences on native species. This study focuses on the effects of an invasive plant pathogen on a vertebrate community and Ixodes pacificus, the vector of the Lyme disease pathogen (Borrelia burgdorferi) in California. Phytophthora ramorum, the causative agent of sudden oak death, is a non-native pathogen killing trees in California and Oregon. We conducted a multi-year study using a gradient of SOD-caused disturbance to assess the impact on the dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes) and the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), two reservoir hosts of B. burgdorferi, as well as the impact on the Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) and the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), both of which are important hosts for I. pacificus but are not pathogen reservoirs. Abundances of P. maniculatus and S. occidentalis were positively correlated with greater SOD disturbance, whereas N. fuscipes abundance was negatively correlated. We did not find a change in space use by O. hemionus. Our data show that SOD has a positive impact on the density of nymphal ticks, which is expected to increase the risk of human exposure to Lyme disease all else being equal. A positive correlation between SOD disturbance and the density of nymphal ticks was expected given increased abundances of two important hosts: deer mice and western fence lizards. However, further research is needed to integrate the direct effects of SOD on ticks, for example via altered abiotic conditions with host-mediated indirect effects.

"BACKGROUND: Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, remains a serious public health concern in many areas of Latin America, including México. It is also endemic in Texas with an autochthonous canine cycle, abundant vectors (Triatoma species) in many counties, and established domestic and peridomestic cycles which make competent reservoirs available throughout the state. Yet, Chagas disease is not reportable in Texas, blood donor screening is not mandatory, and the serological profiles of human and canine populations remain unknown. The purpose of this analysis was to provide a formal risk assessment, including risk maps, which recommends the removal of these lacunae. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The spatial relative risk of the establishment of autochthonous Chagas disease cycles in Texas was assessed using a five-stage analysis. 1. Ecological risk for Chagas disease was established at a fine spatial resolution using a maximum entropy algorithm that takes as input occurrence points of vectors and environmental layers. The analysis was restricted to triatomine vector species for which new data were generated through field collection and through collation of post-1960 museum records in both México and the United States with sufficiently low georeferenced error to be admissible given the spatial resolution of the analysis (1 arc-minute). The new data extended the distribution of vector species to 10 new Texas counties. The models predicted that Triatoma gerstaeckeri has a large region of contiguous suitable habitat in the southern United States and México, T. lecticularia has a diffuse suitable habitat distribution along both coasts of the same region, and T. sanguisuga has a disjoint suitable habitat distribution along the coasts of the United States. The ecological risk is highest in south Texas. 2. Incidence-based relative risk was computed at the county level using the Bayesian Besag-York-Mollié model and post-1960 T. cruzi incidence data. This risk is concentrated in south Texas. 3. The ecological and incidence-based risks were analyzed together in a multi-criteria dominance analysis of all counties and those counties in which there were as yet no reports of parasite incidence. Both analyses picked out counties in south Texas as those at highest risk. 4. As an alternative to the multi-criteria analysis, the ecological and incidence-based risks were compounded in a multiplicative composite risk model. Counties in south Texas emerged as those with the highest risk. 5. Risk as the relative expected exposure rate was computed using a multiplicative model for the composite risk and a scaled population county map for Texas. Counties with highest risk were those in south Texas and a few counties with high human populations in north, east, and central Texas showing that, though Chagas disease risk is concentrated in south Texas, it is not restricted to it. CONCLUSIONS: For all of Texas, Chagas disease should be designated as reportable, as it is in Arizona and Massachusetts. At least for south Texas, lower than N, blood donor screening should be mandatory, and the serological profiles of human and canine populations should be established. It is also recommended that a joint initiative be undertaken by the United States and México to combat Chagas disease in the trans-border region. The methodology developed for this analysis can be easily exported to other geographical and disease contexts in which risk assessment is of potential value.

"The arenavirus genome encodes for a Z-protein, which contains a RING domain that coordinates two zinc ions, and has been identified as having several functional roles at various stages of the virus life cycle. Z-protein binds to multiple host proteins and has been directly implicated in the promotion of viral budding, repression of mRNA translation, and apoptosis of infected cells. Using homology models of the Z-protein from Lassa strain arenavirus, replica exchange molecular dynamics (MD) was used to refine the structures, which were then subsequently clustered. Population-weighted ensembles of low-energy cluster representatives were predicted based upon optimal agreement of the chemical shifts computed with the SPARTA program with the experimental NMR chemical shifts. A member of the refined ensemble was identified to be a potential binder of budding factor Tsg101 based on its correspondence to the structure of the HIV-1 Gag late domain when bound to Tsg101. Members of these ensembles were docked against the crystal structure of human eIF4E translation initiation factor. Two plausible binding modes emerged based upon their agreement with experimental observation, favorable interaction energies and stability during MD trajectories. Mutations to Z are proposed that would either inhibit both binding mechanisms or selectively inhibit only one mode. The C-terminal domain conformation of the most populated member of the representative ensemble shielded protein-binding recognition motifs for Tsg101 and eIF4E and represents the most populated state free in solution. We propose that C-terminal flexibility is key for mediating the different functional states of the Z-protein.

"Animal populations are exposed to large-scale anthropogenic impact from, e.g., climate change, habitat alteration and supplemental stocking. All of these may affect body condition in wintering dabbling ducks, which in turn may affect an individual's survival and reproductive success. The aim of this study was to assess whether there have been morphometric changes in Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and Teal (Anas crecca) over the last 30 years at a major wintering site. Body mass and condition increased from the 1950s-1960s to the 2000s in both species. The increase in body mass amounted to as much as 11.7%, with no corresponding change in body size. Improved body condition was maintained from early to mid-winter, but then converged with historical values for late winter. Our interpretation is that increasingly benign ambient winter conditions permit ducks to maintain better energetic ""safety margins"" throughout winter, and that converging spring departure values may be related to evolutionary flight energetic optima. The observed changes are consistent with large-scale climate amelioration and local/regional habitat improvement (both anthropogenic).

"The study of ingestive behaviour has an extensive history, starting as early as 1918 when Wallace Craig, an animal behaviourist, coined the terms 'appetitive' and 'consummatory' for the two-part sequence of eating, drinking and sexual behaviours. Since then, most ingestive behaviour research has focused on the neuroendocrine control of food ingestion (consummatory behaviour). The quantity of food eaten, however, is also influenced by the drive both to acquire and to store food (appetitive behaviour). For example, hamster species have a natural proclivity to hoard food and preferentially alter appetitive ingestive behaviours in response to environmental changes and/or metabolic hormones and neuropeptides, whereas other species would instead primarily increase their food intake. Therefore, with the strong appetitive component to their ingestive behaviour that is relatively separate from their consummatory behaviour, they seem an ideal model for elucidating the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the control of food hoarding and foraging. This review focuses on the appetitive side of ingestive behaviour, in particular food hoarding, attempting to integrate what is known about the neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating this relatively poorly studied behaviour. An hypothesis is formed stating that the direction of 'energy flux' is a unifying factor for the control of food hoarding.

"Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are acute febrile tick-borne diseases caused by various members of the genera Ehrlichia and Anaplasma (Anaplasmataceae). Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis has become one of the most prevalent life-threatening tick-borne disease in the United States. Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis are becoming more frequently diagnosed as the cause of human infections, as animal reservoirs and tick vectors have increased in number and humans have inhabited areas where reservoir and tick populations are high. Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the etiologic agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME), is an emerging zoonosis that causes clinical manifestations ranging from a mild febrile illness to a fulminant disease characterized by multiorgan system failure. Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis (HGA), previously known as human granulocytotropic ehrlichiosis. This article reviews recent advances in the understanding of ehrlichial diseases related to microbiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, immunity, and treatment of the 2 prevalent tick-borne diseases found in the United States, HME and HGA.

"Brucella spp. establish an intracellular replicative niche in macrophages, while macrophages attempt to eliminate the bacteria by innate defense mechanisms. Brucella spp. possess similar genomes yet exhibit different macrophage infections. Few B. melitensis and B. neotomae enter macrophages with intracellular adaptation occurring over 4-8 hr. Conversely, B. ovis are readily ingested by macrophages and exhibit a persistent plateau of infection. Evaluating early macrophage interaction with Brucella spp. allows discovery of host entry and intracellular translocation mechanisms. Microarray analysis of macrophage transcriptional response following a 4 hr infection by different Brucella spp. revealed common macrophage genes altered in expression compared to uninfected macrophages. Macrophage infection with three different Brucella spp. provokes a common innate immune theme with increased transcript levels of chemokines and defense response genes and decreased transcript levels of GTPase signaling and cytoskeletal function that may affect trafficking of Brucella containing vesicles. For example, transcript levels of genes associated with chemotaxis (IL-1beta, MIP-1alpha), cytokine regulation (Socs3) and defense (Fas, Tnf) were increased, while transcript levels of genes associated with vesicular trafficking (Rab3d) and lysosomal associated enzymes (prosaposin) were decreased. Genes with altered macrophage transcript levels among Brucella spp. infections may correlate with species specific host defenses and intracellular survival strategies. Depending on the infecting Brucella species, gene ontology categorization identified genes differentially involved in cell growth and maintenance, endopeptidase inhibitor activity and G-protein mediated signaling. Examples of decreased gene expression in B. melitensis infection but not other Brucella spp. were growth arrest (Gas2), immunoglobulin receptor (FcgammarI) and chemokine receptor (Cxcr4) genes, suggesting opposing effects on intracellular functions.

"Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii are emerging tick-borne pathogens and are the causative agents of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, human monocytic ehrlichiosis and E. ewingii ehrlichiosis, respectively. Collectively, these are referred to as human ehrlichioses. These obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens of the family Anaplasmataceae are transmitted by Ixodes spp. or Amblyomma americanum ticks and infect peripherally circulating leukocytes to cause infections that range in clinical spectra from asymptomatic seroconversion to mild, severe or, in rare instances, fatal disease. This review describes: the ecology of each pathogen; the epidemiology, clinical signs and symptoms of the human diseases that each causes; the choice methods for diagnosing and treating human ehrlichioses; recommendations for patient management; and is concluded with suggestions for potential future research.

"Lyme borreliosis (LB) is caused by a group of pathogenic spirochetes - most often Borrelia burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii - that are vectored by hard ticks in the Ixodes ricinus-persulcatus complex, which feed on a variety of mammals, birds, and lizards. Although LB is one of the best-studied vector-borne zoonoses, the annual incidence in North America and Europe leads other vector-borne diseases and continues to increase. What factors make the LB system so successful, and how can researchers hope to reduce disease risk - either through vaccinating humans or reducing the risk of contacting infected ticks in nature? Discoveries of molecular interactions involved in the transmission of LB spirochetes have accelerated recently, revealing complex interactions among the spirochete-tick-vertebrate triad. These interactions involve multiple, and often redundant, pathways that reflect the evolution of general and specific mechanisms by which the spirochetes survive and reproduce. Previous reviews have focused on the molecular interactions or population biology of the system. Here molecular interactions among the LB spirochete, its vector, and vertebrate hosts are reviewed in the context of natural maintenance cycles, which represent the ecological and evolutionary contexts that shape these interactions. This holistic system approach may help researchers develop additional testable hypotheses about transmission processes, interpret laboratory results, and guide development of future LB control measures and management.

"The Arenaviridae family currently comprises 22 viral species, each of them associated with a rodent species. This viral family is important both as tractable experimental model systems to study acute and persistent infections and as clinically important human pathogens. Arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a bi-segmented negative-strand RNA genome. The interaction with the cellular receptor and subsequent entry into the host cell differs between Old World and New World arenavirus that use alpha-dystoglycan or human transferring receptor 1, respectively, as main receptors. The recent development of reverse genetic systems for several arenaviruses has facilitated progress in understanding the molecular biology and cell biology of this viral family, as well as opening new approaches for the development of novel strategies to combat human pathogenic arenaviruses. On the other hand, increased availability of genetic data has allowed more detailed studies on the phylogeny and evolution of arenaviruses. As with other riboviruses, arenaviruses exist as viral quasispecies, which allow virus adaptation to rapidly changing environments. The large number of different arenavirus host reservoirs and great genetic diversity among virus species provide the bases for the emergence of new arenaviruses potentially pathogenic for humans.

"Rickettsia typhi (prevalence 1.9%) and R. felis (prevalence 24.8%) DNA were detected in rat fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) collected from mice on Oahu Island, Hawaii. The low prevalence of R. typhi on Oahu suggests that R. felis may be a more common cause of rickettsiosis than R. typhi in Hawaii.
"
"We investigated the role of the western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) as a reservoir host of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. A survey of 222 western gray squirrels in California showed an overall prevalence of B. burgdorferi infection of 30%, although at a county level, prevalence of infection ranged from 0% to 50% by polymerase chain reaction. Laboratory trials with wild-caught western gray squirrels indicated that squirrels were competent reservoir hosts of the Lyme disease bacterium and infected up to 86% of feeding Ixodes pacificus larvae. Infections were long-lasting (up to 14 months), which demonstrated that western gray squirrels can maintain B. burgdorferi trans-seasonally. Non-native eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) and fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) were infrequently infected with B. burgdorferi.
"
"Several arenaviruses cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) in humans, and evidence indicates that the worldwide-distributed prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a neglected human pathogen of clinical significance. Moreover, arenaviruses pose a biodefense threat. No licensed anti-arenavirus vaccines are available, and current anti-arenavirus therapy is limited to the use of ribavirin, which is only partially effective and is associated with anemia and other side effects. Therefore, it is important to develop effective vaccines and better antiviral drugs to combat the dual threats of naturally occurring and intentionally introduced arenavirus infections. The development of arenavirus reverse genetic systems is allowing investigators to conduct a detailed molecular characterization of the viral cis-acting signals and trans-acting factors that control each of the steps of the arenavirus life cycle, including RNA synthesis, packaging and budding. Knowledge derived from these studies is uncovering potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention, as well as facilitating the establishment of assays to identify and characterize candidate antiviral drugs capable of interfering with specific steps of the virus life cycle. Likewise, the ability to generate predetermined specific mutations within the arenavirus genome and analyze their phenotypic expression would significantly contribute to the elucidation of arenavirus-host interactions, including the basis of their ability to cause severe HF. This, in turn, could lead to the development of novel, potent and safe arenavirus vaccines.

"Diagnosis of a case of septicemic plague acquired in rural California was delayed because of a series of confounding events, resulting in concern about reliance on community hospitals as sentinels for detecting potential bioterrorism-related events. An epizootic study confirmed the peridomestic source of Yersinia pestis infection.

"Animal diseases are known to be the origin of many human diseases, and there are many examples from ancient civilizations of plagues that arose from animals, domesticated and wild. Records of attempts to control zoonoses are almost as old. The early focus on food-borne illness evolved into veterinary medicine's support of public health efforts. Key historical events, disease outbreaks, and individuals responsible for their control are reviewed and serve as a foundation for understanding the current and future efforts in veterinary public health. Animal medicine and veterinary public health have been intertwined since humans first began ministrations to their families and animals. In the United States, the veterinary medical profession has effectively eliminated those major problems of animal health that had serious public health ramifications. These lessons and experiences can serve as a model for other countries. Our past must also be a reminder that the battle for human and animal health is ongoing. New agents emerge to threaten human and animal populations. With knowledge of the past, coupled with new technologies and techniques, we must be vigilant and carry on.

"In California, hard (Ixodidae) ticks transmit at least 8 zoonotic disease agents (1 virus, 6 bacteria, 1 protozoan) to humans or other animals. The correct taxonomic identification of all 3 parasitic stages (larvae, nymphs, adults) of ticks is integral to understanding host-tick associations and disease dynamics, but immature ticks, especially the larvae, can be difficult to identify. Here, we present larval keys to the 4 genera of Ixodidae (DermacentorKoch, 1844; HaemaphysalisKoch, 1844; IxodesLatreille, 1795; RhipicephalusKoch, 1844) and to the 18 species of Ixodes known to be established in California. Several new diagnostic features, as well as photographs of microscopic structures, are provided to facilitate identification. Non-exclusive characters are utilized to separate the subgenera IxodiopsisFilippova, 1957 and PholeoixodesSchulze, 1942.

"Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV) is a North American New World arenavirus, first isolated from rats in New Mexico in 1993, and tentatively associated with three human fatalities in California in 1999-2000. However, it remains unclear whether WWAV was the cause of these, or any other, human infections. One important characteristic of viruses that influences pathogenic potential is the choice of cellular receptor and the corresponding tropism of the virus. In the arenaviruses, these properties are determined largely by the viral glycoprotein (GP). We have previously noted for the New World clade B arenaviruses, which include four severe human pathogens, that the ability to cause human disease correlates with the ability of the GP to use the human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) to enter cells. In addition, pseudotyped retroviral vectors displaying the GPs from pathogenic clade B viruses transduced a range of cell lines in vitro that were distinct from those that could be transduced by non-pathogenic clade B viruses. WWAV was initially classified as a New World clade A virus, based on sequence analysis of its nucleoprotein gene. However, more extensive analyses have revealed that WWAV and the other North American arenaviruses are probably recombinant clade A/B viruses, and that the WWAV GP is more closely related to the clade B GPs. Based on this finding, we sought to understand more about the possible pathogenic potential of WWAV by determining whether its clade B-like GP exhibited the characteristics of a pathogenic or non-pathogenic clade B virus. Our studies found that WWAV GP did not use hTfR1 for entry, and that its overall in vitro tropism was most similar to the GPs from the non-pathogenic clade B viruses. Although many viral factors in addition to GP receptor use and tropism determine whether a virus is able to cause disease in humans, our analysis of the WWAV GP does not support the idea that WWAV is a human pathogen.

"Coinfections within hosts present opportunities for horizontal gene transfer between strains and competitive interactions between genotypes and thus can be a critical element of the lifestyles of pathogens. Bartonella spp. are Alphaproteobacteria that parasitize mammalian erythrocytes and endothelial cells. Their vectors are thought to be various biting arthropods, such as fleas, ticks, mites, and lice, and they are commonly cited as agents of various emerging diseases. Coinfections by different Bartonella strains and species can be common in mammals, but little is known about specificity and coinfections in arthropod vectors. We surveyed the rate of mixed infections of Bartonella in flea vectors (Polygenis gwyni) parasitizing cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) in which previous surveys indicated high rates of infection. We found that nearly all fleas (20 of 21) harbored one or more strains of Bartonella, with rates of coinfection approaching 90%. A strain previously identified as common in cotton rats was also common in their fleas. However, another common strain in cotton rats was absent from P. gwyni, while a rare cotton rat strain was quite common in P. gwyni. Surprisingly, some samples were also coinfected with a strain phylogenetically related to Bartonella clarridgeiae, which is typically associated with felids and ruminants. Finally, a locus (pap31) that is characteristically borne on phage in Bartonella was successfully sequenced from most samples. However, sequence diversity in pap31 was novel in the P. gwyni samples, relative to other Bartonella previously typed with pap31, emphasizing the likelihood of large reservoirs of cryptic diversity in natural populations of the pathogen.

"Five microsatellite loci were used to develop multilocus genotypes for Neotoma macrotis (n = 128) and N. fuscipes (n = 29). Several statistical analyses were used to estimate genetic structure, levels of genetic variability, and degree of relatedness within groups of these 2 species. Samples of N. macrotis represented 2 groups and 4 population clusters throughout southern California. Samples of N. fuscipes represented 2 regions in northern and southern California. Genetic structure was detected among samples of N. macrotis and N. fuscipes at a regional level. Both species displayed moderate to high genetic diversity in terms of mean expected heterozygosity (0.939 and 0.804 for N. macrotis and N. fuscipes, respectively) and mean polymorphic information content (0.930 and 0.761 for N. macrotis and N. fuscipes, respectively). Mean relatedness values within regions and populations of N. macrotis indicated 4th-order levels of relatedness within groups (e.g., distant-cousin relationships). Mean relatedness values within regions of N. fuscipes indicated 2nd-order (e.g., half-sibling) relationships within the northern region and 3rd-order (e.g., cousin) relationships in the southern region. One locus in particular (Nma04) was determined to be diagnostic in distinguishing between these 2 species.
"
"Nucleotide sequences from the mitochondrial control region and genotypes from 5 nuclear microsatellite loci were used to examine genetic structure and infer recent (within approximately the last 3,000 years) evolutionary history of a population (549 individuals) of the southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus). Observed heterozygosity values ranged from 0.61 to 0.89 across microsatellite loci and systematically were lower than expected heterozygosity values (0.66-0.95). Probability of unique identity using microsatellite data was high (1 individual in 66,005,424). Fifty-three mitochondrial haplotypes were obtained from 150 individuals. F(ST) values estimated from sequence and microsatellite data were 0.061 and 0.011, respectively, and the R(ST) for microsatellite data was 0.007. Within-group genetic variation ranged from 93.90% to 99.99% depending on whether sequence or microsatellite data were examined. Analyses of microsatellite data suggested that all sampled individuals belonged to a single population, albeit genetically diverse. However, combined data analyses suggested the presence of low levels of substructure attributable to maternal lineages within the population. Low nucleotide-diversity values (0.007-0.010) in addition to high haplotype-diversity values (0.915-0.933) indicate a high number of closely related haplotypes, and suggest that this population may have undergone a recent expansion. However, Fu's F(S) statistic did not fully support this finding, because it did not reveal a significant excess of recent mutations. A phylogenetic approach using the haplotype sequence data and a combined set including both haplotype and genotype data was used to test for evolutionary patterns and history.

"The Arenaviridae family contains 22 recognized virus species, each of them strongly associated with a rodent species (except Tacaribe virus which is associated with a species of bat), suggesting an ancient co-evolutionary process. Although the concept of co-evolution between rodents and arenaviruses is now largely accepted, little has been uncovered in terms of dating the phenomenon and the mechanisms of evolution, including speciation and pathogenicity. These questions are targeted in the present chapter. Old World arenaviruses are associated with the Eurasian rodents in the family Muridae. New World arenaviruses are associated with American rodents in the subfamily Sigmodontinae. The correlation between the rodent host phylogeny and the viruses suggests a long association and a co-evolutionary process. Furthermore, three distinct New World arenaviruses share a common ancestor, demonstrating a unique recombination event that probably occurred in that ancestor. This shows that recombination among arenaviruses of different lineages might occur in nature. Recombination and co-evolutionary adaptation appear as the main mechanisms of arenavirus evolution, generating a high degree of diversity. The diversity among rodent host reservoir and virus species and the potential to exchange genomic material provide a basis for the emergence of new viruses and the risk of these becoming pathogenic for humans.

"Urbanization is intensifying worldwide, with two-thirds of the human population expected to reside in cities within 30 years. The role of cities in human infectious disease is well established, but less is known about how urban landscapes influence wildlife-pathogen interactions. Here, we draw on recent advances in wildlife epidemiology to consider how environmental changes linked with urbanization can alter the biology of hosts, pathogens and vectors. Although urbanization reduces the abundance of many wildlife parasites, transmission can, in some cases, increase among urban-adapted hosts, with effects on rarer wildlife or those living beyond city limits. Continued rapid urbanization, together with risks posed by multi-host pathogens for humans and vulnerable wildlife populations, emphasize the need for future research on wildlife diseases in urban landscapes.
"
"The pathogens that cause Lyme disease (LD), human anaplasmosis, and babesiosis can coexist in Ixodes ticks and cause human coinfections. Although the risk of human coinfection differs by geographic location, the true prevalence of coinfecting pathogens among Ixodes ticks remains largely unknown for the majority of geographic locations. The prevalence of dually infected Ixodes ticks appears highest among ticks from regions of North America and Europe where LD is endemic, with reported prevalences of < or =28%. In North America and Europe, the majority of tick-borne coinfections occur among humans with diagnosed LD. Humans coinfected with LD and babesiosis appear to have more intense, prolonged symptoms than those with LD alone. Coinfected persons can also manifest diverse, influenza-like symptoms, and abnormal laboratory test results are frequently observed. Coinfecting pathogens might alter the efficiency of transmission, cause cooperative or competitive pathogen interactions, and alter disease severity among hosts. No prospective studies to assess the immunologic effects of coinfection among humans have been conducted, but animal models demonstrate that certain coinfections can modulate the immune response. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of coinfection when pursuing laboratory testing or selecting therapy for patients with tick-borne illness.
"
"Serum specimens from 114 patients hospitalized with a febrile illness were tested with an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using Bartonella antigens prepared from 6 species of sigmodontine rodents and 3 known human Bartonella pathogens: B. henselae, B. quintana, and B. elizabethae. Acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples from 5 of these patients showed seroconversion with an IFA titer >512 to rodent-associated Bartonella antigens. The highest titer was against antigen derived from the white-throated woodrat (Neotoma albigula), although this rodent is not necessarily implicated as the source of infection. Three of the 5 who seroconverted showed no cross-reaction to the 3 Bartonella human pathogens. Common clinical characteristics were fever, chills, myalgias, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and transaminasemia. Although antibodies to Bartonella are cross-reactive, high-titer seroconversions to rodent-associated Bartonella antigens in adults with common clinical characteristics should stimulate the search for additional Bartonella human pathogens.
"
"Genetic diversity within a population of the southern plains woodrat was examined using DNA sequences (967 base pairs [bp]) obtained from the control or d-loop region of the mitochondrial genome. One hundred fourteen individuals from 10 collection sites were assigned to 42 haplotypes. Haplotype diversity values were moderate to high (0.974 overall and ranged from 0.524 to 0.964 across collecting sites), whereas nucleotide diversity values were low (0.008 overall and ranged from 0.001 to 0.010 across sites), indicating that this population possesses a high number of closely related haplotypes. Seventy-nine percent of the genetic variability was partitioned within groups that corresponded to the collecting sites. In addition, 13 samples from Texas, New Mexico, and Mexico were included as references for evaluating the evolutionary history of haplotypes. Nested clade analysis revealed that restricted gene flow with isolation by distance in conjunction with contiguous range expansion was responsible for the observed pattern of genetic diversity. A test of neutrality supported the diagnosis of restricted gene flow, but failed to support contiguous range expansion due solely to population growth. Examination of the spatial distribution of the haplotypes indicated that most haplotypes were restricted to a single collecting site; however, a small number of haplotypes were found at 2 or more sites. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that some haplotypes (28.6%) were restricted to the study area whereas the remaining haplotypes occupied a broader geographic region.

"Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis is an emerging infectious disease in the United States and Europe, and PCR methods have been shown to be effective for the diagnosis of acute infections. Numerous PCR assays and primer sets have been reported in the literature. The analytical sensitivities (limits of detection) of 13 published PCR primer sets were compared using DNA extracted from serial dilutions of Anaplasma phagocytophilum-infected HL-60 cells. The specificity of the assays that were able to detect <or=2.5 infected cells was tested by the use of template DNA extracted from Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Rickettsia rickettsii, and Bartonella henselae. The assays with the lowest limits of detection were shown to be a nested assay that amplifies the 16S rRNA gene (primer pairs ge3a-ge10 [primary] and ge9-ge3 [nested]; detects 0.25 infected cell), a direct assay that amplifies the major surface protein gene msp2 (primer pair msp2-3f-msp2-3r; detects 0.25 infected cell), and a direct assay that amplifies the 16S rRNA gene (primer pair ehr521-ehr790; detects 0.25 infected cell). The specificity and limit of detection of the MSP2 and 16S rRNA direct assays were further tested by use of A. phagocytophilum template DNA from both North America and Europe and from human, tick, white-footed mouse, equine, deer, bovine, and wood rat samples and of template DNA from closely related species (Anaplasma marginale, the white-tailed deer agent, and additional E. chaffeensis-positive samples). Three manufacturers' PCR kits were tested and showed distinct variations in the limit of detection, specificity, and nonspecific background amplification. The importance of these results for the molecular diagnosis of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis is discussed.
"
"We investigated the reservoir role of European wild rodents for Anaplasma phagocytophila using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of blood collected from individually tagged rodents captured monthly over 2 years. The only tick species observed in the woodland study site was Ixodes trianguliceps, and ruminant reservoir hosts were not known to occur. A. phagocytophila infections were detected in both bank voles and wood mice but were restricted to periods of peak nymphal and adult tick activity. Most PCR-positive rodents were positive only once, suggesting that rodent infections are generally short-lived and that ticks rather than rodents may maintain the infection over winter. Bank voles were more likely to be PCR positive than wood mice, possibly because detectable infections are longer lived in bank voles. This study confirms that woodland rodents can maintain A. phagocytophila in Great Britain in the absence of other reservoir hosts and suggests that I. trianguliceps is a competent vector.
"
"The rodent-borne Arenaviruses are divided into two major antigenic groups: the Old World and New World complexes. Of the 15 known New World arenaviruses, four (Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and Guanarito) have been associated with hemorrhagic fever in humans. It has been difficult to assess the pathogenic or epidemic potential of the remaining viruses and the threat of emerging disease. We obtained full-length small (S) segment sequence data, encoding the nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein precursor (GPC), from all American arenaviruses to predict their evolutionary and functional relationships. Phylogenetic analysis of NP or GPC amino acid sequences from all New World arenaviruses revealed three lineages and that Tamiami and Whitewater Arroyo viruses were probably derived from a single recombinant progenitor. The results imply that arenaviruses have been evolving independently for a very long time, leading to very diverse groupings that do not correlate with geography, rodent host, or human epidemic potential.

"""It has been commented by someone that 'polyoma' is an adjective composed of a prefix and suffix, with no root between--a meatless linguistic sandwich"" (C. J. Dawe). The very name ""polyomavirus"" is a vague mantel: a name given before our understanding of these viral agents was clear but implying a clear tumor life-style, as noted by the late C. J. Dawe. However, polyomavirus are not by nature tumor-inducing agents. Since it is the purpose of this review to consider the natural function of middle T antigen (MT), encoded by one of the seemingly crucial transforming genes of polyomavirus, we will reconsider and redefine the virus and its MT gene in the context of its natural biology and function. This review was motivated by our recent in vivo analysis of MT function. Using intranasal inoculation of adult SCID mice, we have shown that polyomavirus can replicate with an MT lacking all functions associated with transformation to similar levels to wild-type virus. These observations, along with an almost indistinguishable replication of all MT mutants with respect to wild-type viruses in adult competent mice, illustrate that MT can have a play subtle role in acute replication and persistence. The most notable effect of MT mutants was in infections of newborns, indicating that polyomavirus may be highly adapted to replication in newborn lungs. It is from this context that our current understanding of this well-studied virus and gene is presented.

"Broad-range PCR primers were used to amplify part of the groESL operon of the canine pathogen Ehrlichia ewingii, recently recognized as a human pathogen, and the murine pathogen Ehrlichia muris. Phylogenetic analysis supported the relationships among Ehrlichia species previously determined by comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences. These sequences provide additional PCR targets for species for which few gene sequences have been determined.
"
"The presence of granulocytic ehrlichiae was demonstrated by PCR in Ixodes ricinus ticks and wild small mammals in Switzerland in two areas of endemicity for bovine ehrlichiosis. Six ticks (three females and three nymphs) (1.4%) of 417 I. ricinus ticks collected by flagging vegetation contained ehrlichial DNA. A total of 201 small mammals from five species, wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis), earth vole (Pitymys subterraneus), bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), and common shrew (Sorex araneus), were trapped. The analysis of I. ricinus ticks [corrected] collected on 116 small mammals showed that nine C. glareolus voles and two A. sylvaticus mice hosted infected tick larvae. In these rodents, granulocytic ehrlichia infection was also detected in blood, spleen, liver, and ear samples. Further examinations of 190 small mammals without ticks or with noninfected ticks showed the presence of ehrlichial DNA in spleen and other tissues from six additional C. glareolus, three A. flavicollis, and one S. araneus mammals. This study suggests that A. sylvaticus, A. flavicollis, S. araneus, and particularly C. glareolus are likely to be natural reservoirs for granulocytic ehrlichiae. Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of granulocytic ehrlichiae from ticks and rodents showed a high degree of homology (99 to 100%) with granulocytic ehrlichiae isolated from humans. In contrast, groESL heat shock operon sequence analysis showed a strong divergence (approximately 5%) between the sequences in samples derived from rodents and those derived from samples from questing ticks or from other published ehrlichia sequences. Dual infections with granulocytic ehrlichia and Borrelia burgdorferi were found in ticks and small mammals.
"
"Twenty-eight Borrelia burgdorferi isolates from the Charleston, S.C., area are described. This represents the first report and characterization of the Lyme disease spirochete from that state. The isolates were obtained from December 1994 through December 1995 from the tick Ixodes scapularis, collected from vegetation, and from the rodents Peromyscus gossypinus (cotton mouse), Neotoma floridana (eastern wood rat), and Sigmodon hispidus (cotton rat). All isolates were screened immunologically by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies to B. burgdorferi-specific outer surface protein A (OspA) (antibodies H5332 and H3TS) and B. burgdorferi-specific OspB (antibodies H6831 and H614), a Borrelia (genus)-specific antiflagellin antibody (H9724), Borrelia hermsii-specific antibodies (H9826 and H4825), and two polyclonal antibodies (one to Borrelia species and another to B. burgdorferi). Six of the isolates were analyzed by exposing Western blots to monoclonal antibodies H5332, H3TS, H6831, and H9724. All isolates were also analyzed by PCR with five pairs of primers known to amplify selected DNA target sequences specifically reported to be present in the reference strain, B. burgdorferi B-31. The protein profiles of six of the isolates (two from ticks, one from a cotton mouse, two from wood rats, and one from a cotton rat) also were compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We conclude that the 28 Charleston isolates are B. burgdorferi sensu stricto based on their similarities to the B. burgdorferi B-31 reference strain.

"Dusky-footed wood rats (Neotoma fuscipes) and Peromyscus sp. mice (P. maniculatus and P. truei) were collected from one site in Placer County, one site in Santa Cruz County, and two sites in Sonoma County in northern California. Serum or plasma samples from 260 rodents were tested for antibodies to the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Of these, samples from 25 wood rats (34% of those tested) and 10 (8%) Peromyscus sp. mice were found to be seropositive, but only those from one site. PCR assays targeting the groESL heat shock operon were conducted on all seropositive specimens and a subset of seronegative blood specimens. Ehrlichial DNA was identified in 17 (68%) of the 25 seropositive wood rat blood samples and in 1 of the 10 (10%) Peromyscus sp. specimens. None of 40 seronegative blood samples was PCR positive. Both seropositive and PCR-positive animals were collected during each trapping period. One male tick out of 84 Ixodes pacificus adults collected was PCR positive; samples of Dermacentor occidentalis nymphs and adults were negative. Nucleotide sequences of amplicons from three wood rat blood specimens and from the single PCR-positive tick differed by one and two bases, respectively, from a sequence previously obtained from Ehrlichia equi. At one site in Sonoma County, wood rats had a concurrent high prevalence of seropositivity and PCR positivity, while other sigmodontine rodents collected at the site were only occasionally infected. We suggest that dusky-footed wood rats serve as reservoirs of granulocytic ehrlichial agents in certain areas of northern California. The tick species involved in the transmission of granulocytic ehrlichiae among wood rats remains unknown.

"A long-term monitoring program begun 1 year after the epidemic of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the U.S. Southwest tracked rodent density changes through time and among sites and related these changes to hantavirus infection rates in various small-mammal reservoir species and human disease outbreaks. We assessed the statistical sensitivity of the program's field design and tested for potential biases in population estimates due to unintended deaths of rodents. Analyzing data from two sites in New Mexico from 1994 to 1998, we found that for many species of Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, Neotoma, Dipodomys, and Perognathus, the monitoring program detected species-specific spatial and temporal differences in rodent densities; trap-related deaths did not significantly affect long-term population estimates. The program also detected a short-term increase in rodent densities in the winter of 1997-98, demonstrating its usefulness in identifying conditions conducive to increased risk for human disease.

"Within the past few years, the number of ""new"" human diseases associated with small-mammal reservoirs has increased dramatically, stimulating renewed interest in reservoir ecology research. A consistent, integrative approach to such research allows direct comparisons between studies, contributes to the efficient use of resources and data, and increases investigator safety. We outline steps directed toward understanding vertebrate host ecology as it relates to human disease and illustrate the relevance of each step by using examples from studies of hosts associated with rodent-borne hemorrhagic fever viruses.

"Rodent (Muridae: Sigmodontinae) blood and sera collected from 14 states were tested for seroreactivity to a cultured isolate of the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) agent by using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Of the 1,240 samples tested, 136 (11%) were found to be reactive at titers of > or = 32. Rodents with HGE agent-specific antibodies were found in New York (23% of 491 samples; geometric mean endpoint titer [GMT] = 441), Connecticut (11% of 100 samples; GMT = 481), California (9% of 32 samples; GMT = 323), Colorado (2% of 212 samples; GMT = 256), Florida (7% of 27 samples; GMT = 362), Maryland (7% of 15 samples; titer = 64), New Jersey (4% of 76 samples; titer = 256), and Wisconsin (13% of 8 samples; titer = 128). Samples from Georgia (n = 16), Illinois (n = 27), Nevada (n = 27), North Carolina (n = 52), Ohio (n = 57), and Utah (n = 100) were not reactive. The earliest seroreactive sample was from a Peromyscus leucopus mouse collected in June 1986 in Connecticut, and the majority of the seroreactive samples (68%) were from this species. Samples from other Peromyscus species (P. boylii, P. maniculatus, and P. gossypinus) were also found to be reactive, with a GMT for the genus of 410. Several species of Neotoma woodrats (N. fuscipes, N. lepida, N. albigula, and N. mexicana) from California and Colorado had antibodies that reacted with the HGE agent (genus GMT = 194), suggesting that enzootic cycles of Ehrlichia spp. exist outside of the areas of confirmed human disease. Attempts to amplify and detect ehrlichial DNA from the limited tissues available (n = 40 animals) were unsuccessful. Further studies are needed to determine the identity of the organisms inducing antibody production in these rodent species and to elucidate the epidemiology and public health importance of these agents.

"In Colorado, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is maintained in an enzootic cycle between Ixodes spinipalpis ticks and Neotoma mexicana rats (27). The frequencies of flagellin (fla), 66-kDa protein (p66), and outer surface protein A (ospA) alleles were examined in 71 B. burgdorferi isolates from samples from Colorado. Approximately two-thirds of these samples were isolates from I. spinipalpis ticks that had been cultured in BSK-H medium prior to DNA extraction. The remaining samples were from total DNA extracted directly from infected I. spinipalpis ticks. A portion of each gene was amplified by PCR and screened for genetic variability by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. We identified three alleles in the fla gene, seven in the p66 gene, and seven in the ospA gene. Sequencing verified that the amplified products originated from B. burgdorferi template DNA and indicated 100% sensitivity and specificity of the SSCP analysis. The frequencies of the p66 and ospA alleles were significantly different between cultured and uncultured spirochetes. The number of three-locus genotypes and the genetic diversity of alleles at all loci were consistently lower in cultured spirochetes, suggesting that culturing of B. burgdorferi in BSK-H medium may select for specific genotypes.

"Although zoonotic diseases are generally rare in Canada, a wide range of pathogens can be transmitted from animal reservoirs to humans through insect vectors or direct contact with wild and domestic animals. Across the country researchers with backgrounds ranging from wildlife biology to parasitology and epidemiology are tracking a variety of zoonotic diseases, some of which are causing increasing concern among public health officials.
"
"Of more than 500 arboviruses recognized worldwide, 5 were first isolated in Canada and 58 were first isolated in the United States. Six of these viruses are human pathogens: western equine encephalitis (WEE) and eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) and Powassan (POW) viruses (Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), LaCrosse (LAC) virus (Bunyaviridae, Bunyavirus), and Colorado tick fever (CTF) virus (Reoviridae, Coltivirus). Their scientific histories, geographic distributions, virology, epidemiology, vectors, vertebrate hosts, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical and differential diagnoses, control, treatment, and laboratory diagnosis are reviewed. In addition, mention is made of the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) complex viruses (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus), which periodically cause human and equine disease in North America. WEE, EEE, and SLE viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes between birds; POW and CTF viruses, between wild mammals by ticks; LAC virus, between small mammals by mosquitoes; and VEE viruses, between small or large mammals by mosquitoes. Human infections are tangential to the natural cycle. Such infections range from rare to focal but are relatively frequent where they occur. Epidemics of WEE, EEE, VEE, and SLE viruses have been recorded at periodic intervals, but prevalence of infections with LAC and CTF viruses typically are constant, related to the degree of exposure to infected vectors. Infections with POW virus appear to be rare. Adequate diagnostic tools are available, but treatment is mainly supportive, and greater efforts at educating the public and the medical community are suggested if infections are to be prevented.

"Typhus fever has occurred globally as epidemic and endemic disorders. In 1910, Brill reported a typhus-like illness which Zinsser and others determined to be recurrent epidemic typhus fever. Maxcy, in 1926, proposed rodents and fleas as reservoir and vector, respectively, of endemic typhus, which Dyer confirmed in 1930. Animals experimentally infected with epidemic typhus (Rickettsia prowazeki) are immune to murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi) and vice versa. Similar solid cross-immunity exists for humans. The two diseases are clinically similar in pathologic and serologic reactions. Human epidemic typhus presumably involved a man-louse-man cycle without an animal reservoir. This concept is now questioned. Antibodies to R. prowazeki have been reported in livestock in Africa, rats in Manila, and from flying squirrels and humans in the United States. R. prowazeki was recovered from blood specimens of goats, sheep, from ixodid ticks, louse, and flea-ectoparasites of flying squirrels, and tissues of flying squirrels. More than 20 cases of squirrel-related acute epidemic typhus have been reported in the United States. R. prowazeki has not been recovered from human cases. Chemical studies of R. prowazeki and R. typhi show genetic similarities but differences in genome size and degree of hybridization suggest that interconversions between the two agents do not occur rapidly in nature. It is proposed that, with time, their relatedness will become even closer.

"Rabies in an eastern wood rat was detected by fluorescent antibody testing and mouse inoculation. The results were independently confirmed.

"Pathogens and predatory animals are the main agents used for the biological control of rodents. The pathogens that have been used are of the genus Salmonella; none is rodent-specific and all can cause severe infection in man and domestic animals. Furthermore, rodents frequently develop immunity to, and become carriers of, these organisms, and there is little to commend their use, except in lightly populated areas where control is infrequently applied. The relationships of five predator species with their rodent prey have been examined. The monitor lizard, mongoose, and ferret were for different reasons found to be unsatisfactory, and there is not yet sufficient evidence to warrant further releases of the Japanese weasel. Domestic and feral cats control rodents well in some situations but only after some other agent has removed a large part of the rodent population.

"The author reviews the natural history of the tick vectors of American spotted fever. The discussion concerns the ecology of the Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor andersoni, the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, and the lone-star tick, Amblyomma americanum, all of which are proven vectors of Rocky Mountain spotted fever to man. Also included are the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris and Dermacentor parumapertus, which very rarely bite man but which are considered of importance in maintaining and distributing Rickettsia rickettsi, the etiological agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, in nature. Brief reference is also made to recently developed techniques for studying the ecology of tick vectors.

"The bacterium that causes canine abortion has polynucleotide sequences similar, in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-DNA homology studies, to those of Brucella suis and, by inference from previous data, those of B. abortus and B. melitensis as well as B. neotomae. Therefore, the organism causing canine abortion appears to be a member of the genus Brucella. DNA preparations from Serratia marcescens, Alcaligenes faecalis, and Bordetella bronchiseptica, 58, 62, and 66 mole% guanine plus cytosine, respectively, do not have detectable polynucleotide sequence homologies with B. suis DNA which is 56 mole% guanine plus cytosine. B. ovis DNA lacks some of the polynucleotide sequences present in B. suis DNA and appears to be a deletion mutant. However, a large proportion of B. ovis polynucleotides are similar to those of other Brucella species, which supports the inclusion of B. ovis in the genus.
"
"Deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA's) extracted from organisms presently placed in the genus Brucella (B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. neotomae, and B. suis) possessed very similar polynucleotide sequences. Unlabeled, single-stranded DNA fragments from B. abortus, B. melitensis, B. neotomae, and B. suis were equally effective in competing with the interaction of corresponding radiolabeled, single-stranded DNA fragments with their homologous DNA-agars. Unlabeled fragments of B. ovis, however, did not compete as effectively as the homologous, unlabeled DNA's, and this organism, therefore, had a detectably different polynucleotide composition. The mole percentages of guanine plus cytosine in Brucella DNA's (56 to 58%) were also similar. DNA's from Francisella tularensis, Escherichia coli, and the slow loris did not compete.

"In his comprehensive monograph on plague, published by WHO in 1954, Dr Pollitzer pointed out that despite the marked drop in the incidence of this disease in recent years, he considered it impossible for various reasons to be complacent about the situation. Since this monograph appeared, plague has shown a truly spectacular decrease, but in case this is partly the outcome of a natural periodicity of the infection, the author still feels that the disease ""should be given continued attention by those interested in global public health"". To this end he summarizes here the latest information on the subject, his review covering not only works published since 1954, but also some earlier literature (particularly from the USSR) which was not available to him at the time of preparation of his monograph.

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disease, which is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in the hepatocytes without excess alcohol intake. Circadian rhythms can participate in lipid, glucose, and cholesterol metabolism and are closely related to metabolism seen in this disease. Circadian clock genes can modulate liver lipid metabolism. Desynchrony of circadian rhythms and the influences imparted by external environmental stimuli can increase morbidity. By contrast, synchronizing circadian rhythms can help to alleviate the metabolic disturbance seen in NAFLD. In this review, we have discussed the current research connections that exist between the circadian clock and the metabolism of NAFLD, and we have specifically focused on the key circadian clock genes, Bmal1, Clock, Rev-Erbs, Rors, Pers, Crys, Nocturnin, and DECs.

"PURPOSE: To determine whether high fructose intake (HFI) influences the daily transcriptional clock rhythms of murine extraorbital lacrimal glands (ELGs). METHODS: Timed ELGs were collected from two groups of C57BL/6J mice subjected to a 12-hour light/12-hour dark (LD) cycle for 10 days; the first group received water-only feeding and the second received water with 15% fructose. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to RNA sequencing. A JTK_CYCLE algorithm and computational software were used to determine the periodicity, rhythmicity, and amplitude of the cycling transcripts. The rhythmic transcripts from different conditions were analyzed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. RESULTS: HFI feeding caused massive remodeling of the preexisting rhythmic genes in the normal control (NC)-fed ELGs. The induced transcripts in HFI-fed mice resulted in a profound reorganization of the coordinated transcriptional oscillations and KEGG pathways. Moreover, HFI feeding significantly altered the distribution of the KEGG pathways over an LD in the ELGs. Finally, we found that the ELGs have a robust core clock machinery and HFI feeding altered amplitude and the peak phase of clock gene transcriptional oscillation in ELGs. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term HFI reprograms the daily transcriptomic oscillation of murine ELGs. This information may deepen our understanding of the outcomes of lacrimal glands altered by nutritional challenge.

"The periventricular zone of cerebellum is a germinative niche during the embryonic development, nevertheless its structural organization and functional implications in adult have not been widely studied. Here we disclose the presence of two novel clusters of cells in that area. The first one was named the subventricular cellular cluster (SVCC) and is composed of cells that express glial and neuronal markers. The second was named the ventromedial cord (VMC) and appears as a streak of biciliated cells with microvillosities facing the ventricle, that includes GFAP(+) and nestin(+) cells organized along the periventricular vasculature. The dorsal limit of the SVCC is associated with myelinated axons of neurons of unknown origin. This paper describes the characteristics and organization of these groups of cells. They can be observed from late embryonic development in the transgenic mouse line GFAP-GFP. The SVCC and VMC expand during early postnatal development but are restricted to the central area of the ventricle in adulthood. We did not find evidence of cell proliferation, cell migration or the presence of fenestrated blood vessels. These findings provide new insights into the knowledge of the cellular composition and structural organization of the periventricular zone of cerebellum.

"In microtine and dwarf hamsters low levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and medial amygdala (MeA) play a critical role in the expression of social monogamy in males, which is characterized by high levels of affiliation and low levels of aggression. In contrast, monogamous Peromyscus males display high levels of aggression and affiliative behavior with high levels of testosterone and aromatase activity. Suggesting the hypothesis that in Peromyscus ERα expression will be positively correlated with high levels of male prosocial behavior and aggression. ERα expression was compared within the social neural network, including the posterior medial BST, MeA posterodorsal, medial preoptic area (MPOA), ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), and arcuate nucleus in two monogamous species, P. californicus and P. polionotus, and two polygynous species, P. leucopus and P. maniculatus. The results supported the prediction, with male P. polionotus and P. californicus expressing higher levels of ERα in the BST than their polygynous counter parts, and ERα expression was sexually dimorphic in the polygynous species, with females expressing significantly more than males in the BST in both polygynous species and in the MeA in P. leucopus. Peromyscus ERα expression also differed from rats, mice and microtines as in neither the MPOA nor the VMH was ERα sexually dimorphic. The results supported the hypothesis that higher levels of ERα are associated with monogamy in Peromyscus and that differential expression of ERα occurs in the same regions of the brains regardless of whether high or low expression is associated with social monogamy. Also discussed are possible mechanisms regulating this differential relationship.

"In mammals, the zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 (ZP3) is considered a primary sperm receptor of the oocyte and is hypothesized to be involved in reproductive isolation. We investigated patterns of diversity and selection in the putative sperm-binding region (pSBR) of mouse ZP3 across Cricetidae and Murinae, two hyperdiverse taxonomic groups within muroid rodents. In murines, the pSBR is fairly conserved, in particular the serine-rich stretch containing the glycosylation sites proposed as essential for sperm binding. In contrast, cricetid amino acid sequences of the pSBR were much more variable and the serine-rich motif, typical of murines, was generally substantially modified. Overall, our results suggest a general lack of species specificity of the pSBR across the two muroid families. We document statistical evidence of positive selection acting on exons 6 and 7 of ZP3 and identified several amino acid sites that are likely targets of selection, with most positively selected sites falling within or adjacent to the pSBR.

"Activated natural killer (NK) cells release interferon (IFN)-γ, which is crucial for the control of intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania. In contrast to experimental murine leishmaniasis, the human NK cell response to Leishmania is still poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the interaction of human blood NK cells with promastigotes of different Leishmania species (Leishmania major, Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania infantum, and Leishmania donovani). When peripheral blood mononuclear cells or purified NK cells and monocytes (all derived from healthy blood donors from Germany without a history of leishmaniasis) were exposed to promastigotes, NK cells showed increased surface expression of the activation marker CD69. The extent of this effect varied depending on the Leishmania species; differences between dermotropic and viscerotropic L. infantum strains were not observed. Upregulation of CD69 required direct contact between monocytes and Leishmania and was partly inhibitable by anti-interleukin (IL)-18. Unexpectedly, IL-18 was undetectable in most of the supernatants (SNs) of monocyte/parasite cocultures. Confocal fluorescence microscopy of non-permeabilized cells revealed that Leishmania-infected monocytes trans-presented IL-18 to NK cells. Native, but not heat-treated SNs of monocyte/Leishmania cocultures also induced CD69 on NK cells, indicating the involvement of a soluble heat-labile factor other than IL-18. A role for the NK cell-activating cytokines IL-1β, IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-21, and IFN-α/β was excluded. The increase of CD69 was not paralleled by NK cell IFN-γ production or enhanced cytotoxicity. However, prior exposure of NK cells to Leishmania parasites synergistically increased their IFN-γ release in response to IL-12, which was dependent on endogenous IL-18. CD1c(+) dendritic cells were identified as possible source of Leishmania-induced IL-12. Finally, we observed that direct contact between Leishmania and NK cells reduced the expression of CD56 mRNA and protein on NK cells. We conclude that Leishmania activate NK cells via trans-presentation of IL-18 by monocytes and by a monocyte-derived soluble factor. IL-12 is needed to elicit the IFN-γ-response of NK cells, which is likely to be an important component of the innate control of the parasite.

"Recent epidemiologic studies indicate that leishmaniasis in the Americas is far more abundant and of greater public health importance than was previously recognized. The disease in the New World is caused by a number of different parasite species that are capable of producing a wide variety of clinical manifestations. The outcome of leishmanial infection in humans is largely dependent on the immune responsiveness of the host and the virulence of the infecting parasite strain. This article reviews current concepts of the clinical forms, immunology, pathology, laboratory diagnosis, and treatment of the disease as well as aspects of its epidemiology and control. Recommendations for future research on the disease and its control are made.
"
"The origin of leishmaniasis in the New World is discussed, and the numerous forms of the disease are briefly described. The epidemological pattern of American leishmaniasis is clearly that of a zoonosis in various stages of development. Nine geographical types of cutaneous leishmaniasis are recognized, and probably others exist also; the visceral disease is of the well known Mediterranean type and of a uniform type throughout the Americas. The prevalence of human infection in the different regions is discussed with particular reference to the animal reservoirs. Disturbances of the terrain for agricultural development, road construction, etc., lead to epidemics and there is some evidence that the disease is now spreading in Latin America.

"Life histories can influence the degree of parasite infestations on a host. Pressures exerted on hosts based on age and sex convey varying degrees of parasite prevalence due to differences in host lifestyles, but it is not known how interactions between different host traits affect tick numbers. The objective of this study was to determine if host characteristics (e.g., age, sex, weight, and their interactions) affect the mean number of ticks found on small mammals regardless of host species or habitat. Sherman live traps were placed in forest and grass/forb habitats representative of the southeastern United States. After capture, host characteristics were recorded, and hosts were then searched for ticks. A total of 281 small mammals (148 Peromyscus leucopus, 34 P. maniculatus, 76 Sigmodon hispidus, 16 Microtus pinetorum, and 7 Ochrotomys nuttalli) and 610 ticks (488 Dermacentor variabilis, 114 Ixodes scapularis, 1 Amblyomma americanum, and 7 A. maculatum) were collected in this study. Host's age, sex, and weight affected the number of ticks collected from small mammals and significant interaction effects between host traits occurred (weight by sex, weight by age, and sex by age). For instance, female subadult rodents had significantly more ticks compared to female adults, male subadults had significantly fewer ticks compared to male adults, and the number of ticks on a host increased as host body mass increased. These results support the hypothesis that the number of ticks vary on rodent hosts based on life histories and trait interactions. Therefore, understanding the behavioral mechanisms of a host can aid in the management of parasites in the environment.
"
"Host-parasite interactions are a key determinant of the population dynamics of wild animals, and behaviours that reduce parasite transmission and infection may be important for improving host fitness. While antiparasite behaviours have been demonstrated in laboratory animals and domesticated ungulates, whether these behaviours operate in the wild is poorly understood. Therefore, examining antiparasite behaviours in natural populations is crucial for understanding their ecological significance. In this study, we examined whether two wild rodents (white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, and deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus), selectively foraged away from conspecific faeces or avoided faeces altogether, and whether faecal gastrointestinal parasite status affected their behaviour. We also tested whether wild mice, when nesting, avoided using material that had previously been used by healthy or parasite-infected conspecifics. Our results, in contrast to laboratory mouse studies, suggest that wild mice do not demonstrate faecal avoidance, selective foraging or selective use of nesting material; they preferred being near faeces and did not differentiate between faeces from parasitized and uninfected conspecifics. Behavioural avoidance to reduce parasite infection may still represent an important strategy; however, mice in our study population appeared to favour the opportunity to feed and nest over the risks of coming into contact with faecal-transmitted parasites. Furthermore, the presence of conspecific faeces may actually provide a positive cue of a good foraging or nesting location. Ultimately, balancing the trade-off of performing antiparasite behaviours to reduce infection with missing an important feeding or nesting opportunity may be very different for animals in the wild facing complex and stochastic environments.

"Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligately intracellular, tick-transmitted bacterium that is maintained in nature in a cycle involving at least one and perhaps several vertebrate reservoir hosts. The moderate to severe disease caused by E. chaffeensis in humans, first identified in 1986 and reported for more than 1,000 patients through 2000, represents a prototypical ""emerging infection."" Knowledge of the biology and natural history of E. chaffeensis, and of the epidemiology, clinical features, and laboratory diagnosis of the zoonotic disease it causes (commonly referred to as human monocytic ehrlichiosis [HME]) has expanded considerably in the period since its discovery. In this review, we summarize briefly the current understanding of the microbiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations associated with this pathogen but focus primarily on discussing various ecological factors responsible for the recent recognition of this important and potentially life-threatening tick-borne disease. Perhaps the most pivotal element in the emergence of HME has been the staggering increases in white-tailed deer populations in the eastern United States during the 20th century. This animal serves as a keystone host for all life stages of the principal tick vector (Amblyomma americanum) and is perhaps the most important vertebrate reservoir host for E. chaffeensis. The contributions of other components, including expansion of susceptible human populations, growth and broadening geographical distributions of other potential reservoir species and A. americanum, and improvements in confirmatory diagnostic methods, are also explored.

"Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world with diverse socioeconomic and sanitary conditions, also being the fourth largest pig producer in the world. The aim of the present systematic review was to collect and summarize all HEV published data from Brazil (from 1995 to October 2020) performed in humans, animals, and the environment, in a One Health perspective. A total of 2173 papers were retrieved from five search databases (LILACs, Mendeley, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) resulting in 71 eligible papers after application of exclusion/inclusion criteria. Data shows that HEV genotype 3 (HEV-3) was the only retrieved genotype in humans, animals, and environment in Brazil. The South region showed the highest human seroprevalence and also the highest pig density and industry, suggesting a zoonotic link. HEV-1 and 2 were not detected in Brazil, despite the low sanitary conditions of some regions. From the present review we infer that HEV epidemiology in Brazil is similar to that of industrialized countries (only HEV-3, swine reservoirs, no waterborne transmission, no association with low sanitary conditions). Hence, we alert for the implementation of HEV surveillance systems in swine and for the consideration of HEV in the diagnostic routine of acute and chronic hepatitis in humans.

"The Mexican territory of the Yucatan Peninsula has a tropical climate and harbors a wide variety of domestic, synanthropic, and wild animals, as well as disease vectors. To determine the distribution of recorded zoonotic diseases in the Yucatan Peninsula, scientific publications referring to these diseases in animals and containing geographic coordinates of disease occurrence, were studied. The epidemiological bulletins of the national government were also consulted to obtain information on zoonotic diseases reported in humans in the territory. The territory harbors a wide variety of tropical zoonotic pathogens, including Trypanosoma cruzi, Leptospira interrogans, Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania mexicana, Dirofilaria immitis, and Rickettsia felis. A variety of domestic, synanthropic, and wild animals act as hosts or reservoirs in the transmission cycle of the zoonotic diseases in the Yucatan Peninsula, and some spillover into human populations has also been recorded. There are still zoonotic diseases that have rarely or never been reported in humans, but it is not clear whether this is because these diseases in humans are not common, there is a lack of viable transmission cycle or there is a lack of appropriate diagnosis. It is necessary to continue monitoring vectors, animal hosts, and humans to identify risk factors for zoonotic diseases in the Yucatan Peninsula.

"BACKGROUND: Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) has a high lethality. Severe cases may be rescued by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), alongside substantial complications. High volume hemofiltration (HVHF) is a depurative technique that provides homeostatic balance allowing hemodynamic stabilization in some critically ill patients. METHODS: We implemented HVHF before VA ECMO consideration in the last five severe HCPS patients requiring mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drugs admitted to our intensive care unit. Patients were considered HVHF-responders if VA ECMO was avoided and HVHF-nonresponders if VA ECMO support was needed despite HVHF. A targeted-HVHF strategy compounded by aggressive hyperoncotic albumin, sodium bicarbonate, and calcium supplementation plus ultrafiltration to avoid fluid overload was implemented on three patients. RESULTS: Patients had maximum serum lactate of 8.8 (8.7-12.8) mmol/L and a lowest cardiac index of 1.8 (1.8-1.9) L/min/m(2) . The first two required VA ECMO. They were connected later to HVHF, displayed progressive tachycardia and declining stroke volume. The opposite was true for HVHF-responders who received targeted-HVHF. All patients survived, but one of the VA ECMO patients suffered a vascular complication. CONCLUSION: HVHF may contribute to support severe HCPS patients avoiding the need for VA ECMO in some. Early connection and targeted-HVHF may increase the chance of success.

"Bats are hosts of a range of viruses, and their great diversity and unique characteristics that distinguish them from all other mammals have been related to the maintenance, evolution, and dissemination of these pathogens. Recently, very divergent hantaviruses have been discovered in distinct species of bats worldwide, but their association with human disease remains unclear. Considering the low success rates of detecting hantavirus RNA in bat tissues and that to date no hantaviruses have been isolated from bat samples, immunodiagnostic tools could be very helpful to understand pathogenesis, epidemiology, and geographic range of bat-borne hantaviruses. In this sense, we aimed to identify in silico immunogenic B-cell epitopes present on bat-borne hantaviruses nucleoprotein (NP) and verify if they are conserved among them and other selected members of Mammantavirinae, using a combination of (the three most used) different prediction algorithms, ELLIPRO, Discotope 2.0, and PEPITO server. To support our data, we in silico modeled 3D structures of NPs from representative members of bat-borne hantaviruses, using comparative and ab initio methods due to the absence of crystallographic structures of studied proteins or similar models in the Protein Data Bank. Our analysis demonstrated the antigenic complexity of the bat-borne hantaviruses group, showing a low sequence conservation of epitopes among members of its own group and a minor conservation degree in comparison to Orthohantavirus, with a recognized importance to public health. Our data suggest that the use of recombinant rodent-borne hantavirus NPs to cross-detect antibodies against bat- or shrew-borne viruses could underestimate the real impact of this virus in nature.

"Small mammal communities in the Neotropics are composed largely of sigmodontine rodents. However, many questions regarding these communities remain unanswered, especially those pertaining to fine-scale sympatry and habitat selection. To address this, we examined sigmodontine community structure and vegetation in the western margin of the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest and the southwestern-most extent of the Cerrado (CE) (an extensive South American savanna ecoregion) of Paraguay. Vegetation classifications were derived from satellite imagery combined with maps based on extensive ground-based surveys. The three most abundant species (Akodon montensis, Hylaeamys megacephalus, and Oligoryzomys nigripes) were found most often in microsympatry with conspecifics, and were negatively associated with other species. Akodon montensis was associated with high forest (HF), and H. megacephalus with bamboo understory (BU), whereas O. nigripes did not exhibit a habitat preference. The first two species' distributions within the landscape were found to be driven primarily by habitat selection, and O. nigripes by a behavioral response (avoidance) to the presence of the other two species. Moreover, habitat influences whether or not a particular species associates with, or avoids, conspecifics or other species.
"
"Understanding the role of species traits in mediating ecological interactions and shaping community structure is a key question in ecology. In this sense, parasite population parameters allow us to estimate the functional importance of traits in shaping the strength of interactions among hosts and parasites in a network. The aim of this study was to survey and analyse the small mammal-helminth network in a forest reserve of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest in order to understand (i) how functional traits (type of parasite life cycle, site of infection in their host, host and parasite body length, host diet, host locomotor habit and host activity period) and abundance influence host–parasite interactions, (ii) whether these traits explain species roles, and (iii) if this relationship is consistent across different parasite population parameters (presence and absence, mean abundance and prevalence). Networks were modular and their structural patterns did not vary among the population parameters. Functional traits and abundance shaped the interactions observed between parasites and hosts. Host species abundance, host diet and locomotor habit affected their centrality and/or vulnerability to parasites. For helminths, infection niche was the main trait determining their central roles in the networks.

"Although rodents represent approximately 40% of all living mammalian species, our knowledge regarding their reproductive biology is still scarce. Due to their high vulnerability to environmental changes, wild rodents have become beneficial models for ecological studies. Thus, we aimed to comparatively investigate key functional testis parameters in four sexually mature wild rodent species (A. cursor, A. montensis, N. lasiurus, and O. nigripes). These species belong to the Cricetidae family, which is the most diverse family of rodents in South America, with a total of ~120 species in Brazil. The results found for the gonadosomatic index and the sickled sperm head shape observed strongly suggest that the species here evaluated are promiscuous, prolific, and short-lived. The duration of spermatogenesis was relatively short and varied from ~35-40 days. Both the percentage of seminiferous tubules (ST) in the testis parenchyma (~95-97%) and the number of Sertoli cells (SC) (~48-70 million) per testis gram were very high, whereas a fairly good SC efficiency (~8-13 round spermatids per SC) was observed. In comparison to other mammalian species studied, particularly the rodents of the suborder Myomorpha (i.e. hamsters, rats and mice), the rodents herein investigated exhibited very high (~62-80 million) daily sperm production per testis gram. This impressive spermatogenic efficiency resulted mainly from the short duration of spermatogenesis and quite high values found for the ST percentage in the testis and the SC number per testis gram. We expect that the knowledge here obtained will help conservation programs and the proper management of wildlife.

"In times when herpesvirus genomic data were scarce, the cospeciation between these viruses and their hosts was considered to be common knowledge. However, as more herpesviral sequences were made available, tree reconciliation analyses started to reveal topological incongruences between host and viral phylogenies, indicating that other cophylogenetic events, such as intrahost speciation and host switching, likely played important roles along more than 200 million years of evolutionary history of these viruses. Tree reconciliations performed with undated phylogenies can identify topological differences, but offer insufficient information to reveal temporal incongruences between the divergence timing of host and viral species. In this study, we performed cophylogenetic analyses using time-resolved trees of herpesviruses and their hosts, based on careful molecular clock modelling. This approach enabled us to infer cophylogenetic events over time and also integrate information on host biogeography to better understand host-virus evolutionary history. Given the increasing amount of sequence data now available, mismatches between host and viral phylogenies have become more evident, and to account for such phylogenetic differences, host switches, intrahost speciations and losses were frequently found in all tree reconciliations. For all subfamilies in Herpesviridae, under all scenarios we explored, intrahost speciation and host switching were more frequent than cospeciation, which was shown to be a rare event, restricted to contexts where topological and temporal patterns of viral and host evolution were in strict agreement.

"Ecologically based rodent management strategies are arising as a sustainable approach to rodent control, allowing us to preserve biodiversity while safeguarding human economic activities. Despite predator signals being known to generally repel rodents, few field-based studies have compared the behavioral effects of several predators on different prey species, especially in Neotropical ecosystems. Here, we used camera traps to study the behavior of rodent species native to the Chilean temperate forest (Abrothrix spp., long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) and an introduced rodent (black rat Rattus rattus). Using playbacks of raptor calls, we experimentally exposed rodents to three predation risk treatments: austral pygmy owl calls (Glaucidium nana), rufous-legged owl calls (Strix rufipes) and a control treatment (absence of owl calls). We evaluated the effects of the treatments on the time allocated to three behaviors: feeding time, locomotor activity and vigilance. Moonlight and vegetation cover were also considered in the analyses, as they can modify perceived predation risk. Results showed that predator calls and environmental factors modified prey behavior depending not only on the predator species, but also on the rodent species. Consequently, owl playbacks could be regarded as a promising rodent control tool, knowing that future studies would be critical to deeply understand differences between species in order to select the most effective predator cues.

"Despite being nearly 10 months into the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, the definitive animal host for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the causal agent of COVID-19, remains unknown. Unfortunately, similar problems exist for other betacoronaviruses, and no vouchered specimens exist to corroborate host species identification for most of these pathogens. This most basic information is critical to the full understanding and mitigation of emerging zoonotic diseases. To overcome this hurdle, we recommend that host-pathogen researchers adopt vouchering practices and collaborate with natural history collections to permanently archive microbiological samples and host specimens. Vouchered specimens and associated samples provide both repeatability and extension to host-pathogen studies, and using them mobilizes a large workforce (i.e., biodiversity scientists) to assist in pandemic preparedness. We review several well-known examples that successfully integrate host-pathogen research with natural history collections (e.g., yellow fever, hantaviruses, helminths). However, vouchering remains an underutilized practice in such studies. Using an online survey, we assessed vouchering practices used by microbiologists (e.g., bacteriologists, parasitologists, virologists) in host-pathogen research. A much greater number of respondents permanently archive microbiological samples than archive host specimens, and less than half of respondents voucher host specimens from which microbiological samples were lethally collected. To foster collaborations between microbiologists and natural history collections, we provide recommendations for integrating vouchering techniques and archiving of microbiological samples into host-pathogen studies. This integrative approach exemplifies the premise underlying One Health initiatives, providing critical infrastructure for addressing related issues ranging from public health to global climate change and the biodiversity crisis.

"Emerging and re-emerging RNA viruses pose significant public health, economic, and societal burdens. Hantaviruses (genus Orthohantavirus, family Hantaviridae, order Bunyavirales) are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded, tripartite RNA viruses that are emerging zoonotic pathogens harbored by small mammals such as rodents, bats, moles, and shrews. Orthohantavirus infections cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in humans (HCPS). Active targeted surveillance has elucidated high-resolution phylogeographic relationships between patient- and rodent-derived orthohantavirus genome sequences and identified the infection source by temporally and spatially tracking viral genomes. Active surveillance of patients with HFRS entails 1) recovering whole-genome sequences of Hantaan virus (HTNV) using amplicon (multiplex PCR-based) next-generation sequencing, 2) tracing the putative infection site of a patient by administering an epidemiological questionnaire, and 3) collecting HTNV-positive rodents using targeted rodent trapping. Moreover, viral genome tracking has been recently performed to rapidly and precisely characterize an outbreak from the emerging virus. Here, we reviewed genomic epidemiological and active surveillance data for determining the emergence of zoonotic RNA viruses based on viral genomic sequences obtained from patients and natural reservoirs. This review highlights the recent studies on tracking viral genomes for identifying and characterizing emerging viral outbreaks worldwide. We believe that active surveillance is an effective method for identifying rodent-borne orthohantavirus infection sites, and this report provides insights into disease mitigation and preparedness for managing emerging viral outbreaks.

"Understanding vertebrate-vector interactions is vitally important for understanding the transmission dynamics of arthropod-vectored pathogens and depends on the ability to accurately identify the vertebrate source of blood-engorged arthropods in field collections using molecular methods. A decade ago, molecular techniques being applied to arthropod blood meal identification were thoroughly reviewed, but there have been significant advancements in the techniques and technologies available since that time. This review highlights the available diagnostic markers in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and discusses their benefits and shortcomings for use in molecular identification assays. Advances in real-time PCR, high resolution melting analysis, digital PCR, next generation sequencing, microsphere assays, mass spectrometry, and stable isotope analysis each offer novel approaches and advantages to bloodmeal analysis that have gained traction in the field. New, field-forward technologies and platforms have also come into use that offer promising solutions for point-of-care and remote field deployment for rapid bloodmeal source identification. Some of the lessons learned over the last decade, particularly in the fields of DNA barcoding and sequence analysis, are discussed. Though many advancements have been made, technical challenges remain concerning the prevention of sample degradation both by the arthropod before the sample has been obtained and during storage. This review provides a roadmap and guide for those considering modern techniques for arthropod bloodmeal identification and reviews how advances in molecular technology over the past decade have been applied in this unique biomedical context.

"The global emergence of zoonotic viruses, including poxviruses, poses one of the greatest threats to human and animal health. Forty years after the eradication of smallpox, emerging zoonotic orthopoxviruses, such as monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses continue to infect humans as well as wild and domestic animals. Currently, the geographical distribution of poxviruses in a broad range of hosts worldwide raises concerns regarding the possibility of outbreaks or viral dissemination to new geographical regions. Here, we review the global host ranges and current epidemiological understanding of zoonotic orthopoxviruses while focusing on orthopoxviruses with epidemic potential, including monkeypox, cowpox, and vaccinia viruses.

"Orthohantaviruses give rise to the emerging infections such as of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Eurasia and the Americas, respectively. In this review we will provide a comprehensive analysis of orthohantaviruses distribution and circulation in Eurasia and address the genetic diversity and evolution of Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV), which causes HFRS in this region. Current data indicate that the geographical location and migration of the natural hosts can lead to the orthohantaviruses genetic diversity as the rodents adapt to the new environmental conditions. The data shows that a high level of diversity characterizes the genome of orthohantaviruses, and the PUUV genome is the most divergent. The reasons for the high genome diversity are mainly caused by point mutations and reassortment, which occur in the genome segments. However, it still remains unclear whether this diversity is linked to the disease's severity. We anticipate that the information provided in this review will be useful for optimizing and developing preventive strategies of HFRS, an emerging zoonosis with potentially very high mortality rates.

"The first patient infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Panama was reported on March 9, 2020. Here, we describe the first case of recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the country. The patient was a 49-year-old male high school teacher, who did not show any primary symptoms of COVID-19 described by health authorities as the signs for medical attention. Nonetheless, he became severely ill over the course of 2 weeks and almost lost the battle against COVID-19. The identification of the first cluster of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission in the secondary school where the patient of this case report taught, led to the closure of the school and, a day after, the shutdown of the national education system, which may have prevented the spread and slowed the transmission rate of COVID-19 during the early stages of invasion. This case report highlights the need to increase awareness among healthcare professionals in Latin America to consider symptoms such as anosmia and dysgeusia as the sentinel signs of COVID-19 infection in order to prevent deaths, especially in high-risk patients.

"A key requirement in studies of endemic vector-borne or zoonotic disease is an estimate of the spatial variation in vector or reservoir host abundance. For many vector species, multiple indices of abundance are available, but current approaches to choosing between or combining these indices do not fully exploit the potential inferential benefits that might accrue from modelling their joint spatial distribution. Here, we develop a class of multivariate generalized linear geostatistical models for multiple indices of abundance. We illustrate this novel methodology with a case study on Norway rats in a low-income urban Brazilian community, where rat abundance is a likely risk factor for human leptospirosis. We combine three indices of rat abundance to draw predictive inferences on a spatially continuous latent process, rattiness, that acts as a proxy for abundance. We show how to explore the association between rattiness and spatially varying environmental factors, evaluate the relative importance of each of the three contributing indices and assess the presence of residual, unexplained spatial variation, and identify rattiness hotspots. The proposed methodology is applicable more generally as a tool for understanding the role of vector or reservoir host abundance in predicting spatial variation in the risk of human disease.

"We present a review on the natural infection by trypanosomatids of nonhuman vertebrates in Chile, aiming to synthesize and update the knowledge on the diversity of trypanosomatids infecting native and alien vertebrate species. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of literature records published from 1900 to April 2020 on four databases, focusing on the 21 genera of trypanosomatids and Chile. The methods and findings of our review have been based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (prisma) checklist. We found 29,756 records but only 71 presented relevant information for this review. Overall, there are only two reported trypanosomatid genera infecting vertebrate species in Chile, the genera Trypanosoma and Leishmania. The former is mostly represented by Trypanosoma cruzi (90% of the total records) and to a much lesser extent by Trypanosoma avium, Trypanosoma humboldti, Trypanosoma lewisi, and a couple of unidentified trypanosomatids. A total of 25 mammals have been reported as being infected by T. cruzi, including 14 native and 11 alien species from Orders Artiodactyla, Carnivora, Chiroptera, Didelphimorphia, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla, and Rodentia. Extensive screening studies using new analytical tools are necessary to grasp the whole potential diversity of trypanosomatid species infecting vertebrates in Chile.

"Hantaviruses, part of the Bunyaviridae family, are a genus of negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that cause two major diseases: New-World Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome and Old-World Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome. Hantaviruses generally are found worldwide with each disease corresponding to their respective hemispheres. New-World Hantaviruses spread by specific rodent-host reservoirs and are categorized as emerging viruses that pose a threat to global health and security due to their high mortality rate and ease of transmission. Incidentally, reports of Hantavirus categorization as a bioweapon are often contradicted as both US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention refer to them as Category A and C bioagents respectively, each retaining qualitative levels of importance and severity. Concerns of Hantavirus being engineered into a novel bioagent has been thwarted by Hantaviruses being difficult to culture, isolate, and purify limiting its ability to be weaponized. However, the natural properties of Hantaviruses pose a threat that can be exploited by conventional and unconventional forces. This review seeks to clarify the categorization of Hantaviruses as a bioweapon, whilst defining the practicality of employing New-World Hantaviruses and their effect on armies, infrastructure, and civilian targets.

"The Bartonella species are zoonotic agents that infect mammals and are transmitted by arthropod vectors. Approximately 18 distinct genotypes cause diseases in humans, and may be spread by both domestic and wild animals. In Brazil, Bartonella genotypes have been identified in several species of wild mammals, and in the present study, we analyzed samples from non-human primates (marmosets), marsupials, rodents, and bats, and compared them with the genotypes described in mammals from Brazil, to examine the distribution of Bartonella genotypes in two impacted areas of Rio de Janeiro state, in southeastern Brazil. We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to detect the Bartonella DNA using partial sequences of the gltA, ftsZ, and groEL genes. We generated Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood trees to characterize the positive PCR samples and infer the phylogenetic relationships of the genotypes. A total of 276 animals were captured, including 110 bats, 91 rodents, 38 marsupials, and 37 marmosets. The DNA of Bartonella was amplified from tissue samples collected from 12 (4.34%) of the animals, including eight rodents - Akodon cursor (5/44) and Nectomys squamipes (3/27) - and four bats, Artibeus lituratus (3/58) and Carollia perspicillata (1/15). We identified Bartonella genotypes closely related to those described in previous studies, as well as new genotypes in both the rodent and the bat samples. Considering the high diversity of the Bartonella genotypes and hosts identified in the present study, further research is needed to better understand the relationships between the different Bartonella genotypes and their vectors and host species. The presence of Bartonella in the wild rodents and bats from the study area indicates that the local human populations may be at risk of infection by Bartonella due to the spillover of these strains from the wild environment to domestic and peri-domestic environments.

"The House mice (Mus musculus Linnaeus, 1758), play an important role in the transmission of diseases, both in humans and livestock, through ectoparasite carried on their feces, urine and hair remnants. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ectoparasites infestation, as well as their quantitative and qualitative abundance and, prevalence in the house mice captured from Hai'l region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Parasitological investigations were performed on 70 house mice trapped during 2012-2013 from two localities (Hai'l City residential area and Al-Khitah agricultural farm habitats in Hai'l region). Captured mice were identified as males (34.3% and 48.6%) and females (65.7% and 51.4%) from the residential and agricultural farm habitats, respectively. The findings of the study showed that the sex ratio of the mice found in different habitats did not influence the level of ectoparasite infestation (P > 0.05). Therefore, we combined only sex-wise samples for each habitat and isolated habitats treated separately for our subsequent analyses. A total of 514 ectoparasites individuals belong to four species were recovered from the mice, which included 339 of flea (Xenopsylla cheopis Rothschild, 1903), 39 of sucking lice (Polyplax spinulosa Burmeister, 1835), 37 of sucking lice Polyplax serrata Burmeister, 1839), and 99 of mite species (Laelaps echidninus Berlese, 1887). The presence of zoonotic parasites indicates that Mus musculus as a reservoir, might represent a danger to the public health particularly in the two sampled areas. Results also suggest an increasingly need for further studies to assess the role of the ectoparasites of house mice and their possible involvment in transmission of diseases among these areas.

"The small messenger RNA (SmRNA) of the Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV), a rodent-borne member of the Hantaviridae family of viruses of the Bunyavirales order, encodes a multifunctional nucleocapsid (N) protein and for a nonstructural (NSs) protein of unknown function. We have previously shown the expression of the ANDV-NSs, but only in infected cell cultures. In this study, we extend our early findings by confirming the expression of the ANDV-NSs protein in the lungs of experimentally infected golden Syrian hamsters. Next, we show, using a virus-free system, that the ANDV-NSs protein antagonizes the type I interferon (IFN) induction pathway by suppressing signals downstream of the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and upstream of TBK1. Consistent with this observation, the ANDV-NSs protein antagonized mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-induced IFN-β, NF-κB, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE) promoter activity. Results demonstrate that ANDV-NSs binds to MAVS in cells without disrupting the MAVS-TBK-1 interaction. However, in the presence of the ANDV-NSs ubiquitination of MAVS is reduced. In summary, this study provides evidence showing that the ANDV-NSs protein acts as an antagonist of the cellular innate immune system by suppressing MAVS downstream signaling by a yet not fully understand mechanism. Our findings reveal new insights into the molecular regulation of the hosts' innate immune response by the Andes orthohantavirus.IMPORTANCE Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV) is endemic in Argentina and Chile and is the primary etiological agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in South America. ANDV is distinguished from other hantaviruses by its unique ability to spread from person to person. In a previous report, we identified a novel ANDV protein, ANDV-NSs. Until now, ANDV-NSs had no known function. In this new study, we established that ANDV-NSs acts as an antagonist of cellular innate immunity, the first line of defense against invading pathogens, hindering the cellular antiviral response during infection. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms used by ANDV to establish its infection.

"Zoonotic pathogens and parasites that are transmitted from vertebrates to humans are a major public health risk with high associated global economic costs. The spread of these pathogens and risk of transmission accelerate with recent anthropogenic land-use changes (LUC) such as deforestation, urbanisation, and agricultural intensification, factors that are expected to increase in the future due to human population expansion and increasing demand for resources.We systematically review the literature on anthropogenic LUC and zoonotic diseases, highlighting the most prominent mammalian reservoirs and pathogens, and identifying avenues for future research.The majority of studies were global reviews that did not focus on specific taxa. South America and Asia were the most-studied regions, while the most-studied LUC was urbanisation. Livestock were studied more within the context of agricultural intensification, carnivores with urbanisation and helminths, bats with deforestation and viruses, and primates with habitat fragmentation and protozoa.Research into specific animal reservoirs has improved our understanding of how the spread of zoonotic diseases is affected by LUC. The behaviour of hosts can be altered when their habitats are changed, impacting the pathogens they carry and the probability of disease spreading to humans. Understanding this has enabled the identification of factors that alter the risk of emergence (such as virulence, pathogen diversity, and ease of transmission). Yet, many pathogens and impacts of LUC other than urbanisation have been understudied.Predicting how zoonotic diseases emerge and spread in response to anthropogenic LUC requires more empirical and data synthesis studies that link host ecology and responses with pathogen ecology and disease spread. The link between anthropogenic impacts on the natural environment and the recent COVID-19 pandemic highlights the urgent need to understand how anthropogenic LUC affects the risk of spillover to humans and spread of zoonotic diseases originating in mammals.

"Vector-borne infectious disease dynamics result mainly from the intertwined effect of the diversity, abundance, and behaviour of hosts and vectors. Most studies, however, have analysed the relationship between host-species diversity and infection risk, focusing on vector population instead of individuals, probably dismissing the level at which the transmission process occurs. In this paper, we examine the importance of the host community in accounting for infection risk, at both population and individual levels, using the wild transmission of the protozoan that causes Chagas disease as a vector-borne disease model. Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, transmitted by triatomine insects to mammals. We assessed if T. cruzi infection in vectors is explained by small mammal diversity and their densities (total and infected), when infection risk is measured at population level as infection prevalence (under a frequency-dependent transmission approach) and as density of infected vectors (density-dependent transmission approach), and when measured at individual level as vector infection probability. We analysed the infection status of 1974 vectors and co-occurring small mammal hosts in a semiarid-Mediterranean ecosystem. Results revealed that regardless of the level of analysis, only one host rodent species accounted for most variation in vector infection risk, suggesting a key role in the transmission cycle. To determine the factors explaining vector-borne disease dynamics, infection risk should be assessed at different scales, reflecting the factors meaningful from the vector's perspective and considering vector class-specific features.

"INTRODUCTION: Hantaviruses are a group of single-stranded RNA viruses carried by small rodent reservoirs, transmitted to humans through inhalation of aerosolized particles of rodent feces, urine, or saliva. In Panama, the Choclo orthohantavirus has been associated with Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (n = 54) and Hantavirus Fever (n = 53). In 2018, there were 107 cases of hantavirus diseases, the majority in the Tonosí district, and 4 deaths. As there is no vaccine or treatment for hantavirus, proper prevention measures by community members is key to stopping outbreaks. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated hantavirus knowledge, attitudes, and practices in one corregimiento of Tonosí, Panama to determine what factors influence uptake of prevention practices and high level of knowledge. We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 124 residents covering hantavirus knowledge, attitudes based in the Health Belief Model (perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived obstacles, perceived benefits, and cues to action) and prevention practices. There was an overall high level of knowledge (median score: 4/6), though 20% did not know the route of transmission. The mean number of reported practices performed per person was 8.4 (range: 4-12). Most people had heard of hantavirus through other community members. In linear regression, lower perceived obstacles predicted higher preventive practice score. Reported obstacles to preventive practices included physical restrictions, such as age and health state. In ordinal logistic regression, higher education level and knowing more people who had previously been sick with hantavirus contributed to higher knowledge score. CONCLUSIONS: Future interventions should focus on removing barriers to performing preventive practices. As most people learned of hantavirus through community members, interventions should be community-based and involve those who have experienced the disease. Any future education materials should address confusions about route of transmission and be targeted at those with a lower education level.

"This review focuses on reports of hepatitis E virus, hantavirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, and arenavirus in synanthropic rodents (Rattus rattus, Rattus norvegicus, and Mus musculus) within urban environments. Despite their potential impact on human health, relatively few studies have addressed the monitoring of these viruses in rodents. Comprehensive control and preventive activities should include actions such as the elimination or reduction of rat and mouse populations, sanitary education, reduction of shelters for the animals, and restriction of the access of rodents to residences, water, and food supplies.

"Emerging viruses that cause pneumonia in humans are agents which normally circulate in the animal population but can move to human hosts under certain circumstances, which determines the occurrence of a new type of disease. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is caused by a coronavirus. The disease has a wide symptomatic spectrum that can range from asymptomatic infections to fulminant respiratory failure. Diagnostic confirmation is achieved through viral isolation. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also produced by a coronavirus, is capable of producing a serious pulmonary disease outbreak with no reappearance. The clinical presentation includes fever, malaise, cough, and headache followed by diarrhea. Other coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) can cause serious lower respiratory infections in small children, the elderly, and immunosuppressed patients. Influenza virus is widespread in nature, and avian virus may spread to humans, as has been reported with H7N9, H5N1, H10N8, and H6N1. Cardiopulmonary hantavirus syndrome, a feverish disease characterized by respiratory insufficiency and shock, is produced by Andes virus. Other emerging viruses are enterovirus D68 and polyomavirus.

"BACKGROUND: Scrub typhus is an emerging vector-borne zoonosis, caused by Orientia spp. and transmitted by larvae of trombiculid mites, called chiggers. It mainly occurs within a region of the Asia-Pacific called the tsutsugamushi triangle, where rodents are known as the most relevant hosts for the trombiculid vector. However, the reservoir(s) and vector(s) of the scrub typhus outside Asia-Pacific are unknown. The disease has recently been discovered on and is considered endemic for Chiloé Island in southern Chile. The aim of the present work was to detect and determine the prevalence of chiggers on different rodent species captured in probable sites for the transmission of orientiae responsible for scrub typhus on Chiloé Island in southern Chile and to molecularly examine collected chiggers for the presence of Orientia DNA. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During the austral summer 2018, rodents were live-trapped in six sites and examined for chigger infestation. All study sites were rural areas on Chiloé Island, previously identified as probable localities where human cases acquired the scrub typhus. During a total of 4,713 trap-nights, 244 rodents of seven species were captured: the most abundant was Abrothrix olivacea. Chiggers were detected on all seven rodent species with a 55% prevalence rate. Chiggers showed low host specificity and varied according to site specific host abundance. Three genera of trombiculids were identified. Herpetacarus was the most abundant genus (93%), prevalent in five of the six sites. Infestation rates showed site specific differences, which were statistically significant using a GLM model with binomial errors. Molecular analyses proved that 21 of 133 (15.8%) mite pools were positive for Orientia species, all of them belonged to the genus Herpetacarus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study firstly reports the presence of different rodent-associated chigger mites positive for Orientia sp., in a region endemic for scrub typhus in southern Chile. Herpetacarus and two other genera of mites were found with high infestation rates of rodents in sites previously identified as probable exposure of scrub typhus cases. A substantial percentage of mite pools were positive for Orientia DNA, suggesting that chigger mites serve as vectors and reservoirs of this emerging zoonosis in South America.

"Unplanned urbanization increases the exposure of people to environmental hazards. Within a landscape ecology framework, this study is a diagnosis of human health risk in San Martín, an urban district of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Risk was estimated by combining four hazard indexes (water and air pollution, and mosquito and rodent infestation) and a vulnerability index. Each index was obtained by integrating environmental and socio-demographic layers in a Geographic Information System. Spatial autocorrelation was assessed for each hazard, vulnerability and risk indexes using Moran's tests. Also, spatial associations between pairs of variables were addressed by means of Geographically Weighted Regressions. The robustness of hazard and vulnerability indexes was checked by a sensitivity analysis. In General San Martín district, 83.3% of the population is exposed to relatively high levels of at least one hazard; 7.4% is exposed to relatively high levels of all hazards (11.5% of the total area) and only 16.7% lives in areas of relatively low levels of all hazards (15.4% of the total area). Areas where hazard intensity was relatively high corresponded to those areas where the most vulnerable population lives, enhancing human health risk. The models for hazards and vulnerability were reasonably robust to changes in the weights of the variables considered. Our results highlight the spatially heterogeneous nature of human health risk in an urban landscape, and reveal the location of critical risk hotspots where reduction or mitigation actions should be focused.

"Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is characterized by capillary leak, pulmonary edema (PE), and shock, which leads to death in up to 40% of patients. Treatment is supportive, including mechanical ventilation (MV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Hemodynamic monitoring is critical to titrate therapy and to decide ECMO support. Transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) provides hemodynamic and PE data that have not been systematically used to understand HCPS pathophysiology. We identified 11 HCPS patients monitored with TPTD: eight on MV, three required ECMO. We analyzed 133 measurements to describe the hemodynamic pattern and its association with PE. The main findings were reduced stroke volume, global ejection fraction (GEF), and preload parameters associated with increased extravascular lung water and pulmonary vascular permeability compatible with hypovolemia, myocardial dysfunction, and increased permeability PE. Lung water correlated positively with heart rate (HR, r = 0.20) and negatively with mean arterial pressure (r = -0.27) and GEF (r = -0.36), suggesting that PE is linked to hemodynamic impairment. Pulmonary vascular permeability correlated positively with HR (r = 0.31) and negatively with cardiac index (r = -0.49), end-diastolic volume (r = -0.48), and GEF (r = -0.40), suggesting that capillary leak contributes to hypovolemia and systolic dysfunction. In conclusion, TPTD data suggest that in HCPS patients, increased permeability leads to PE, hypovolemia, and circulatory impairment.

"Few studies have focused on rodent communities at the margins of an ecoregion or the limits of species' distributions, where the community may be more sensitive to extrinsic variables, both biotic and abiotic. This study evaluates sigmodontine rodent species diversity and overall abundance, and variation associated with climatic variables, in three locations with differing levels of habitat degradation. The study was conducted in northeastern Paraguay, near the western limit of the Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest and near the distributional limits of the three most abundant species in the study sites. Three mark-recapture grids were established and classified as least, moderately and most-degraded based on an analysis of several vegetation parameters. The grids were sampled for five consecutive nights, six times during two years. Shannon diversity and overall abundance were calculated for each sample. Monthly Multivariate ENSO Index and rainfall values were obtained from publicly available resources. Product-moment correlations were calculated between community and climatic parameters, including cumulative values for the climatic variables. The same correlations were calculated for the three common sigmodontine species. 1,632 captures were recorded, representing 13 sigmodontine species. Species richness in the samples (one session on one grid) varied from four to seven. Akodon montensis, Hylaeamys megacephalus and Oligoryzomys nigripes were the three most abundant species. In general, species diversity was negatively correlated with ENSO index, precipitation and precipitation anomaly, including cumulative one- to six-month cumulative values of each. Total sigmodontine abundance was positively correlated with the climatic variables. However, these correlations were not uniform among the three levels of habitat degradation, nor did the three abundant species show similar correlation patterns. The three most abundant species are each near their distributional limits, whereas several less abundant species have distributions that extend well beyond the study area. This somewhat counterintuitive result bears further investigation in other sites at ecoregional margins, to determine whether it is a commonly observed pattern, or an exception. Overall sigmodontine abundances were generally reflective of Akodon montensis abundance, which generally correlated with precipitation (including cumulative amounts). Our analyses of these longitudinal data showed two major effects on sigmodontine species diversity and population. First, they are impacted by habitat and secondly, they are affected by climate (ENSO, precipitation). However, individual species are not impacted similarly. Akodon montensis abundances primarily were correlated with abiotic (climatic) variables, and the correlations were consistent across habitats (biotic factors). In contrast, Hylaeamys megacephalus abundance was correlated with climatic variables in two habitats, but not the moderately-degraded habitat, and Oligoryzomys nigripes abundance was not correlated with climate in the most-degraded habitat."
"In recent years, negative-sense RNA virus classification and taxon nomenclature have undergone considerable transformation. In 2016, the new order Bunyavirales was established, elevating the previous genus Hantavirus to family rank, thereby creating Hantaviridae. Here we summarize affirmed taxonomic modifications of this family from 2016 to 2019. Changes involve the admission of >30 new hantavirid species and the establishment of subfamilies and novel genera based on DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering (DEmARC) analysis of genomic sequencing data. We outline an objective framework that can be used in future classification schemes when more hantavirids sequences will be available. Finally, we summarize current taxonomic proposals and problems in hantavirid taxonomy that will have to be addressed shortly.

"Hantaviruses are important zoonotic pathogens of public health importance that are found on all continents except Antarctica and are associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Old World and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the New World. Despite the significant disease burden they cause, no FDA-approved specific therapeutics or vaccines exist against these lethal viruses. The lack of available interventions is largely due to an incomplete understanding of hantavirus pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms of virus replication, including cellular entry. Hantavirus Gn/Gc glycoproteins are the only viral proteins exposed on the surface of virions and are necessary and sufficient to orchestrate virus attachment and entry. In vitro studies have implicated integrins (β(1-3)), DAF/CD55, and gC1qR as candidate receptors that mediate viral attachment for both Old World and New World hantaviruses. Recently, protocadherin-1 (PCDH1) was demonstrated as a requirement for cellular attachment and entry of New World hantaviruses in vitro and lethal HPS in vivo, making it the first clade-specific host factor to be identified. Attachment of hantavirus particles to cellular receptors induces their internalization by clathrin-mediated, dynamin-independent, or macropinocytosis-like mechanisms, followed by particle trafficking to an endosomal compartment where the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes can occur. Following membrane fusion, which requires cholesterol and acid pH, viral nucleocapsids escape into the cytoplasm and launch genome replication. In this review, we discuss the current mechanistic understanding of hantavirus entry, highlight gaps in our existing knowledge, and suggest areas for future inquiry.

"Hantaviruses (Family: Hantaviridae; genus: Orthohantavirus) and their associated human diseases occur globally and differ according to their geographic distribution. The structure of small mammal assemblages and phylogenetic relatedness among host species are suggested as strong drivers for the maintenance and spread of hantavirus infections in small mammals. We developed predictive models for hantavirus infection prevalence in rodent assemblages using defined ecological correlates from our current knowledge of hantavirus-host distributions to provide predictive models at the global and continental scale. We utilized data from published research between 1971-2014 and determined the biological and ecological characteristics of small mammal assemblages to predict the prevalence of hantavirus infections. These models are useful in predicting hantavirus disease outbreaks based on environmental and biological information obtained through the surveillance of rodents.
"
"Due to their large geographic distribution and potential high mortality rates in human infections, hantaviruses constitute a worldwide threat to public health. As such, they have been the subject of a large array of clinical, virological and eco-evolutionary studies. Many experiments have been conducted in vitro or on animal models to identify the mechanisms leading to pathogenesis in humans and to develop treatments of hantavirus diseases. Experimental research has also been dedicated to the understanding of the relationship between hantaviruses and their reservoirs. However, these studies remain too scarce considering the diversity of hantavirus/reservoir pairs identified, and the wide range of issues that need to be addressed. In this review, we present a synthesis of the experimental studies that have been conducted on hantaviruses and their reservoirs. We aim at summarizing the knowledge gathered from this research, and to emphasize the gaps that need to be filled. Despite the many difficulties encountered to carry hantavirus experiments, we advocate for the need of such studies in the future, at the interface of evolutionary ecology and virology. They are critical to address emerging areas of research, including hantavirus evolution and the epidemiological consequences of individual variation in infection outcomes.

"Hantaviruses are transmitted by rodents producing the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas. Today, no human cases of HPS have been reported in Mexico in spite of similar environmental conditions with Central America and the USA where several cases have occurred. To understand the current situation of hantaviruses in Mexico and the public health risk, a systematic review of studies was conducted reporting hantaviruses in rodents to known state seroprevalence and hantavirus genotypes. Simultaneously, this study identified the potential hantaviruses based on the phylogenetic diversity (PD) of hantaviruses reported in the Americas in hosts with the distribution in Mexico. A total 3862 rodents belonging to 82 species have been tested since 1999 to 2017. Overall, 392 individuals representing 43 rodent species were seropositive, and the seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 69.22%. Seven hantaviruses genotypes have been described in Mexico and three are zoonotic. Four host species of rodents are widely distributed in Mexico harboring the highest PD of viruses. According to the hosts distribution, 16 genotypes could be circulating in Mexico and some of these represent a potential risk for public health. This study proposed multidisciplinary and interinstitutional collaborations to implement systematic surveillance in rodents.

"Hepatozoon spp. are Apicomplexan protozoa that parasitize a wide diversity of vertebrate hosts. In Brazil, few studies have reported the occurrence of Hepatozoon spp. in rodent species. Additionally, an evaluation of the population structure and distribution of Hepatozoon species over several Brazilian biomes has not yet been performed. The present work aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of Hepatozoon spp. in rodents from 31 genera sampled in five Brazilian biomes. Samples were submitted to PCR assays for Hepatozoon spp. targeting two regions of the 18S rRNA gene. Infection by Hepatozoon spp. was detected in 195 (42.2%) rodents comprising 24 genera. Phylogenetic analyses of 18S rRNA sequences grouped all sequences in the clade of Hepatozoon spp. previously detected in rodents and reptiles, apart from those detected in domestic/wild carnivores. These data raise two non-exclusive hypotheses: (i) rodents play an important role as intermediate or paratenic hosts for Hepatozoon infections in reptiles; and (ii) rodents do not seem to participate in the epidemiology of Hepatozoon infections of domestic/wild canids and felids in Brazil. TCS analyses performed with available 18S rRNA Hepatozoon sequences detected in rodents from Brazil showed the occurrence of six haplotypes, which were distributed in two large groups: one from rodents inhabiting the coastal region of Brazil and Mato Grosso state, and another from rodents from the central region of the country. A wide survey of the South American territory will help to elucidate the evolutionary history of Hepatozoon spp. parasitizing Rodentia in the American continent.

"Hantaviruses, members of the order Bunyavirales, family Hantaviridae, have a world-wide distribution and are responsible for greater than 150,000 cases of disease per year. The spectrum of disease associated with hantavirus infection include hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) also known as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or treatments for these hantavirus diseases. This review provides a summary of the status of vaccine and antiviral treatment efforts including those tested in animal models or human clinical trials.

"BACKGROUND: Currently, there is an increasing global interest for the study of how infectious diseases could be linked to climate and weather variability. The Chagas disease was described in 1909 by Carlos Chagas, and is caused by the flagellate protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. The Chagas disease is considered one of the biggest concerns in public health in Latin America. In Chile, the main vectors involved in the transmission of T. cruzi are arthropods of the Triatominae subfamily. Moreover, another main transmission way is through of vectors by fecal-urine way, however, oral way also has been described among others transmission form. OBJECTIVES: In order to get understand outbreaks of Chagas-disease, we search for possible relationships between the frequency of cases in the Chilean population and atmospheric oscillations. METHODS: We explored the two most important atmospheric oscillations in the Southern Hemisphere: southern oscillation index (SOI) and Antarctic oscillation (AAO), during the available years with official data. Because the number of migrant people born outside from Chile increasing significantively between 2014 and 2018, we used for the analysis two different periods from data available official data: (i) 2001 to 2014, (ii) 2001 to 2017. FINDINGS: For both periods we observed a significant and positive relation between AAO one year before. However, for the 2001 to 2014 period positive SOI one year before, which is related with La Niña phases, was the more important variable. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: The Chagas disease frequency per year in Chile was found to depend mainly on SOI in previous year, whose values can be determined one year in advance. Therefore, it is possible to partially forecast annual frequency patterns. This could have important applications in public health strategies and for allocating resources for the management of the disease.

"BACKGROUND: Oil palm plantation establishment in Colombia has the potential to impact Chagas disease transmission by increasing the distribution range of Rhodnius prolixus. In fact, previous studies have reported Trypanosoma cruzi natural infection in R. prolixus captured in oil palms (Elaeis guineensis) in the Orinoco region, Colombia. The aim of this study is to understand T. cruzi infection in vectors in oil palm plantations relative to community composition and host dietary specialization by analyzing vector blood meals and comparing these results to vectors captured in a native palm tree species, Attalea butyracea. METHODS: Rhodnius prolixus nymphs (n = 316) were collected from A. butyracea and E. guineensis palms in Tauramena, Casanare, Colombia. Vector blood meals from these nymphs were determined by amplifying and sequencing a vertebrate-specific 12S rRNA gene fragment. RESULTS: Eighteen vertebrate species were identified and pigs (Sus scrofa) made up the highest proportion of blood meals in both habitats, followed by house mouse (Mus musculus) and opossum (Didelphis marsupialis). Individual bugs feeding only from generalist mammal species had the highest predicted vector infection rate, suggesting that generalist mammalian species are more competent hosts for T. cruzi infection . CONCLUSIONS: Oil palm plantations and A. butyracea palms found in altered areas provide a similar quality habitat for R. prolixus populations in terms of blood meal availability. Both habitats showed similarities in vector infection rate and potential host species, representing a single T. cruzi transmission scenario at the introduced oil palm plantation and native Attalea palm interface.

"Hantaviruses can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. In recent decades, repeated outbreaks of hantavirus disease have led to public concern and have created a global public health burden. Hantavirus spillover from natural hosts into human populations could be considered an ecological process, in which environmental forces, behavioral determinants of exposure, and dynamics at the human-animal interface affect human susceptibility and the epidemiology of the disease. In this review, we summarize the progress made in understanding hantavirus epidemiology and rodent reservoir population biology. We mainly focus on three species of rodent hosts with longitudinal studies of sufficient scale: the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius, the main reservoir host for Hantaan virus [HTNV], which causes HFRS) in Asia, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus, the main reservoir host for Sin Nombre virus [SNV], which causes HPS) in North America, and the bank vole (Myodes glareolus, the main reservoir host for Puumala virus [PUUV], which causes HFRS) in Europe. Moreover, we discuss the influence of ecological factors on human hantavirus disease outbreaks and provide an overview of research perspectives.

"The Andes Orthohantavirus (ANDV), which causes the hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, enters cells via integrins, and a change from leucine to proline at residue 33 in the PSI domain (L33P), impairs ANDV recognition. We assessed the association between this human polymorphism and ANDV infection. We defined susceptible and protective genotypes as ""TT"" (coding leucine) and ""CC"" (coding proline), respectively. TT was present at a rate of 89.2% (66/74) among the first cohort of ANDV cases and at 60% (63/105) among exposed close-household contacts, who remained uninfected (p < 0.05). The protective genotype (CC) was absent in all 85 ANDV cases, in both cohorts, and was present at 11.4% of the exposed close-household contacts who remained uninfected. Logistic regression modeling for risk of infection had an OR of 6.2⁻12.6 (p < 0.05) in the presence of TT and well-known ANDV risk activities. Moreover, an OR of 7.3 was obtained when the TT condition was analyzed for two groups exposed to the same environmental risk. Host genetic background was found to have an important role in ANDV infection susceptibility, in the studied population.

"The order of Bunyavirales includes numerous (re)emerging viruses that collectively have a major impact on human and animal health worldwide. There are no vaccines for human use or antiviral drugs available to prevent or treat infections with any of these viruses. The development of efficacious and safe drugs and vaccines is a pressing matter. Ideally, such antivirals possess pan-bunyavirus antiviral activity, allowing the containment of every bunya-related threat. The fact that many bunyaviruses need to be handled in laboratories with biosafety level 3 or 4, the great variety of species and the frequent emergence of novel species complicate such efforts. We here examined the potential druggable targets of bunyaviruses, together with the level of conservation of their biological functions, structure, and genetic similarity by means of heatmap analysis. In the light of this, we revised the available models and tools currently available, pointing out directions for antiviral drug discovery.

"A recurrent theme in viral immune evasion is the sabotage of MHC-I antigen presentation, which brings virus the concomitant issue of 'missing-self' recognition by NK cells that use inhibitory receptors to detect surface MHC-I proteins. Here, we report that rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP) encodes a Qa-1 like protein (pQa-1) via RNA splicing to counteract NK activation. While pQa-1 surface expression is stabilized by the same canonical peptides presented by murine Qa-1, pQa-1 is GPI-anchored and resistant to the activity of RHVP pK3, a ubiquitin ligase that targets MHC-I for degradation. pQa-1 tetramer staining indicates that it recognizes CD94/NKG2A receptors. Consistently, pQa-1 selectively inhibits NKG2A(+) NK cells and expression of pQa-1 can protect tumor cells from NK control in vivo. Collectively, these findings reveal an innovative NK evasion strategy wherein RHVP encodes a modified Qa-1 mimic refractory to MHC-I sabotage and capable of specifically engaging inhibitory receptors to circumvent NK activation.

"Zoonotic viral infections represent an important public health problem across the globe. Unlike infectious agents that are limited to humans, the presence of domestic and wild animal reservoirs and insect and arthropod vectors greatly complicate transmission dynamics and make control measures very difficult to implement. Some viral zoonoses are categorized as “emerging infectious diseases” because they are newly recognized or have shown significant changes in their geographic range and/or epidemiologic characteristics. This article provides updated information on the current status of the most important viral zoonotic diseases. The recent upsurge in Ebola virus infections in West Africa and the emergence of Zika virus in the Western Hemisphere are highlighted.

"BACKGROUND: The southern Amazon Basin in the Madre de Dios region of Peru has undergone rapid deforestation and habitat disruption, leading to an unknown zoonotic risk to the growing communities in the area. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We surveyed the prevalence of rodent-borne Leptospira and Bartonella, as well as potential environmental sources of human exposure to Leptospira, in 4 communities along the Inter-Oceanic Highway in Madre de Dios. During the rainy and dry seasons of 2014-2015, we captured a total of 97 rodents representing 8 genera in areas that had experienced different degrees of habitat disturbance. Primarily by using 16S metagenomic sequencing, we found that most of the rodents (78%) tested positive for Bartonella, whereas 24% were positive for Leptospira; however, the patterns differed across seasons and the extent of habitat disruption. A high prevalence of Bartonella was identified in animals captured across both trapping seasons (72%-83%) and the relative abundance was correlated with increasing level of land disturbance. Leptospira-positive animals were more than twice as prevalent during the rainy season (37%) as during the dry season (14%). A seasonal fluctuation across the rainy, dry, and mid seasons was also apparent in environmental samples tested for Leptospira (range, 55%-89% of samples testing positive), and there was a high prevalence of this bacteria across all sites that were sampled in the communities. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data indicate the need for increased awareness of rodent-borne disease and the potential for environmental spread along the communities in areas undergoing significant land-use change.

"Like many other large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, herpesviruses are known to capture host genes to evade host defenses. Little is known about the detailed natural history of such genes, nor do we fully understand their evolutionary dynamics. A major obstacle is that they are often highly divergent, maintaining very low sequence similarity to host homologs. Here we use the herpesvirus genus Rhadinovirus as a model system to develop an analytical approach that combines complementary evolutionary and bioinformatic techniques, offering results that are both detailed and robust for a range of genes. Using a systematic phylogenetic strategy, we identify the original host lineage of viral genes with high confidence. We show that although host immunomodulatory genes evolve rapidly compared to other host genes, they undergo a clear increase in purifying selection once captured by a virus. To characterize this shift in detail, we developed a novel technique to identify changes in selection pressure that can be attributable to particular domains. These findings will inform us on how viruses develop strategies to evade the immune system, and our synthesis of techniques can be reapplied to other viruses or biological systems with similar analytical challenges.IMPORTANCE Viruses and hosts have been shown to capture genes from one another as part of the evolutionary arms race. Such genes offer a natural experiment on the effects of evolutionary pressure, since the same gene exists in vastly different selective environments. However, sequences of viral homologs often bear little similarity to the original sequence, complicating the reconstruction of their shared evolutionary history with host counterparts. In this study, we use a genus of herpesviruses as a model system to comprehensively investigate the evolution of host-derived viral genes, using a synthesis of genomics, phylogenetics, selection analysis, and nucleotide and amino acid modeling.

"Hantaviruses (order Bunyavirales, family Hantaviridae), known as important zoonotic human pathogens, possess the capacity to exchange genome segments via genetic reassortment due to their tri-segmented genome. Although not as frequent as in the arthropod-borne bunyaviruses, reports indicating reassortment events in the evolution of hantaviruses have been recently accumulating. The intra- and inter-lineage reassortment between closely related variants has been repeatedly reported for several hantaviruses including the rodent-borne human pathogens such as Sin Nombre virus, Puumala virus, Dobrava-Belgrade virus, or Hantaan virus as well as for the more recently recognized shrew-borne hantaviruses, Imjin and Seewis. Reassortment between more distantly related viruses was rarely found but seems to play a beneficial role in the process of crossing the host species barriers. Besides the findings based on phylogenetic studies of naturally occurring strains, hantavirus reassortants were generated also in in vitro studies. Interestingly, only reassortants with exchanged M segments could be generated suggesting that a high degree of genetic compatibility is required for the S and L segments while the exchange of M segment is better tolerated or is particularly beneficial. Altogether, the numerous reports on hantavirus reassortment, summarized in this review, clearly demonstrate that reassortment events play a significant role in hantavirus evolution and contributed to the currently recognized hantavirus diversity.

"BACKGROUND: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is an infection endemic in Chile and Argentina, caused by Andes hantavirus (ANDV). The rodent Oligoryzomys longicaudatus is suggested as the main reservoir, although several other species of Sigmodontinae are known hosts of ANDV. Here, we explore potential ANDV transmission risk to humans in southern South America, based on eco-epidemiological associations among: six rodent host species, seropositive rodents, and human HPS cases. METHODS: We used ecological niche modeling and macroecological approaches to determine potential geographic distributions and assess environmental similarity among rodents and human HPS cases. RESULTS: Highest numbers of rodent species (five) were in Chile between 35° and 41°S latitude. Background similarity tests showed niche similarity in 14 of the 56 possible comparisons: similarity between human HPS cases and the background of all species and seropositive rodents was supported (except for Abrothrix sanborni). Of interest among the results is the likely role of O. longicaudatus, Loxodontomys micropus, Abrothrix olivaceus, and Abrothrix longipilis in HPS transmission to humans. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support a role of rodent species' distributions as a risk factor for human HPS at coarse scales, and suggest that the role of the main reservoir (O. longicaudatus) may be supported by the broader rodent host community in some areas.

"Changes in landscape and land use can drive the emergence of zoonoses, and hence, there has been great interest in understanding how land cover change and the cascade of ecological effect associated with it are associated with emerging infectious diseases. In this chapter, we review how a spatially hierarchical approach can be used to guide research into the links between landscape properties and zoonotic diseases. Methodological advances have played a role in the revival of landscape epidemiology and we introduce the role of methodologies such as geospatial analysis and mathematical modeling. Importantly, we discuss cross-scale analysis and how this would provide a richer perspective of the ecology of zoonotic diseases. Finally, we will provide an overview of how hierarchical research strategies and modeling might be generally used in analyses of infectious zoonoses originating in wildlife.

"Human abdominal angiostrongyliasis (HAA) is a parasitic disease caused by the accidental ingestion of the nematode Angiostrongylus costaricensis in its larval form. Human infection can lead to severe ischemic and inflammatory intestinal lesions, sometimes complicated by life-threatening ileal perforations. Only one case had been reported in Martinique, an Island in the French Antilles, in 1988. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of patients diagnosed with abdominal angiostrongyliasis at the University Hospital of Martinique between 2000 and 2017. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the incidence and perform a descriptive analysis of the clinical, biological, radiological, and histopathological features of HAA in Martinique. Two confirmed cases and two probable cases were identified in patients aged from 1 to 21 years during the 18-year period, with an estimated incidence of 0.2 cases per year (0.003 case/year/100.000 inhabitants (IC95% = 0.00-0.05)). All patients presented with abdominal pain associated with high blood eosinophilia (median: 7.24 G/L [min 4.25; max 52.28 G/L]). Two developed ileal perforation and were managed by surgery, with diagnostic confirmation based on histopathological findings on surgical specimens. The other two cases were probable, with serum specimens reactive to Angiostrongylus sp. antigen in the absence of surgery. All cases improved without sequelae. The description of this case series highlights the need to increase awareness of this life-threatening disease in the medical community and to facilitate access to specific diagnostic tools in Martinique. Environmental and epidemiological studies are needed to broaden our knowledge of the burden of this disease.

"After a brief introduction about the factors that are involved in science development, and world and Brazilian evolutionary genetics, the studies developed in Porto Alegre in this area were reviewed. Four periods in the development of this group were distinguished: (a) Origins and first expansion (1949-1961); (b) Second expansion (1962-1988); (c) Third expansion (1989-2001); and (d) The last 15 years (2002-present). The international Porto Alegre Biological Evolution Workshops (PABEWs), with five biannual events from 2007 o 2015, were also mentioned. The final message stressed the importance of the maintenance of this and other Brazilian groups of research through adequate finance and recognition.

"The origin of Vaccinia virus (VACV) outbreaks in Brazil remains unknown, but since the isolation of VACV in Mus musculus mice during a zoonotic outbreak affecting cattle and milkers, peridomestic rodents have been suggested to be a link between cows and wild animals. Considering that experimentally infected mice eliminate viral particles in their feces, we investigated the presence of VACV in the feces and urine of wild rodents that were captured in the forest areas surrounding milking farms in the central west region of São Paulo State. For the first time, this work reports the detection of VACV by PCR in the feces of naturally infected Oligoryzomys flavescens, Oligoryzomys nigripes, and Sooretamys angouya, and in the urine of Oligorizomys flavescens, which raises important questions about the spread of VACV by rodent feces and its potential to induce clinical infections in cows.

"Most human pathogenic hantaviruses cause severe hemorrhagic fevers with a high rate of fatalities, such as occurs due to the genotypes causing hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome carried by the New World Sigmodontinae and Neotominae rodents. An increasing number of outbreaks and the possibility of cases spreading over international borders have led to greater interest in these viruses and the environmental determinants that facilitate their transmission. Rodents, shrews, moles and bats act as reservoir hosts of hantaviruses, and within the hantavirus transmission flow, the prevalence and distribution of infection in reservoir hosts is influenced by a range of factors. Climate change and landscape alteration affect hantavirus transmission, but the outcomes can differ among different hantaviruses and for the same virus in differentbiomes. However, it is evident that the underlying mechanisms that mediate hantavirus transmission are largely unknown, so that much work remains to be done regarding the transmission dynamics of hantaviruses. Overall, our review highlights the importance of examining interactions over several trophic levels and the underlying mechanisms (density and trait-mediated indirect effects) linking predation risk and hantavirus transmission, to develop an ecological framework to understand disease in natural, preserved and degraded systems.

"The orthopoxviruses (OPV) comprise several emerging viruses with great importance to human and veterinary medicine, including vaccinia virus (VACV), which causes outbreaks of bovine vaccinia (BV) in South America. Historically, VACV is the most comprehensively studied virus, however, its origin and natural hosts remain unknown. VACV was the primary component of the smallpox vaccine, largely used during the smallpox eradication campaign. After smallpox was declared eradicated, the vaccination that conferred immunity to OPV was discontinued, favoring a new contingent of susceptible individuals to OPV. VACV infections occur naturally after direct contact with infected dairy cattle, in recently vaccinated individuals, or through alternative routes of exposure. In Brazil, VACV outbreaks are frequently reported in rural areas, affecting mainly farm animals and humans. Recent studies have shown the role of wildlife in the VACV transmission chain, exploring the role of wild rodents as reservoirs that facilitate VACV spread throughout rural areas. Furthermore, VACV circulation in urban environments and the significance of this with respect to public health, have also been explored. In this review, we discuss the history, epidemiological, ecological and clinical aspects of natural VACV infections in Brazil, also highlighting alternative routes of VACV transmission, the factors involved in susceptibility to infection, and the natural history of the disease in humans and animals, and the potential for dissemination to urban environments.

"BACKGROUND: Fragmentation of native forests is a highly visible result of human land-use throughout the world. In this study, we evaluated the effects of landscape fragmentation and matrix features on the genetic diversity and structure of Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, the natural reservoir of Hantavirus in southern South America. We focused our work in the Valdivian Rainforest where human activities have produced strong change of natural habitats, with an important number of human cases of Hantavirus. METHODS: We sampled specimens of O. longicaudatus from five native forest patches surrounded by silvoagropecuary matrix from Panguipulli, Los Rios Region, Chile. Using the hypervariable domain I (mtDNA), we characterized the genetic diversity and evaluated the effect of fragmentation and landscape matrix on the genetic structure of O. longicaudatus. For the latter, we used three approaches: (i) Isolation by Distance (IBD) as null model, (ii) Least-cost Path (LCP) where genetic distances between patch pairs increase with cost-weighted distances, and (iii) Isolation by Resistance (IBR) where the resistance distance is the average number of steps that is needed to commute between the patches during a random walk. RESULTS: We found low values of nucleotide diversity (π) for the five patches surveyed, ranging from 0.012 to 0.015, revealing that the 73 sampled specimens of this study belong to two populations but with low values of genetic distance (γ(ST) ) ranging from 0.022 to 0.099. Likewise, we found that there are no significant associations between genetic distance and geographic distance for IBD and IBR. However, we found for the LCP approach, a significant positive relationship (r = 0.737, p = 0.05), with shortest least-cost paths traced through native forest and arborescent shrublands. DISCUSSION: In this work we found that, at this reduced geographical scale, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus shows genetic signs of fragmentation. In addition, we found that connectivity between full growth native forest remnants is mediated by the presence of dense shrublands and native forest corridors. In this sense, our results are important because they show how native forest patches and associated routes act as source of vector species in silvoagropecuary landscape, increasing the infection risk on human population. This study is the first approach to understand the epidemiological spatial context of silvoagropecuary risk of Hantavirus emergence. Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of landscape fragmentation in order to generate new predictive models based on vector intrinsic attributes and landscape features.

"Q fever is a worldwide zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii-a small obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium found in a variety of animals. It is transmitted to humans by inhalation of contaminated aerosols from urine, feces, milk, amniotic fluid, placenta, abortion products, wool, and rarely by ingestion of raw milk from infected animals. Nested PCR can improve the sensitivity and specificity of testing while offering a suitable amplicon size for sequencing. Serial dilutions were performed tenfold to test the limit of detection, and the result was 10× detection of C. burnetti DNA with internal nested PCR primers relative to trans-PCR. Different biological samples were tested and identified only in nested PCR. This demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of the primers. Of the 19 samples, which amplify the partial sequence of C. burnetii, 12 were positive by conventional PCR and nested PCR. Seven samples-five spleen tissue samples from rodents and two tick samples-were only positive in nested PCR. With these new internal primers for trans-PCR, we demonstrate that our nested PCR assay for C. burnetii can achieve better results than conventional PCR.

"BACKGROUND: Understanding the ecological processes that are involved in the transmission of zoonotic pathogens by small mammals may aid adequate and effective management measures. Few attempts have been made to analyze the ecological aspects that influence pathogen infection in small mammals in livestock production systems. We describe the infection of small mammals with Leptospira spp., Brucella spp., Trichinella spp. and Cysticercus fasciolaris and assess the related intrinsic and extrinsic factors in livestock production systems in central Argentina at the small mammal community, population and individual levels. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Ten pig farms and eight dairy farms were studied by removal trapping of small mammals from 2008 to 2011. Each farm was sampled seasonally over the course of one year with cage and Sherman live traps. The 505 small mammals captured (14,359 trap-nights) included three introduced murine rodents, four native rodents and two opossums. Leptospira spp., anti-Brucella spp. antibodies and Trichinella spp. were found in the three murine rodents and both opossums. Rattus norvegicus was also infected with C. fasciolaris; Akodon azarae and Oligoryzomys flavescens with Leptospira spp.; anti-Brucella spp. antibodies were found in A. azarae. Two or more pathogens occurred simultaneously on 89% of the farms, and each pathogen was found on at least 50% of the farms. Pathogen infections increased with host abundance. Infection by Leptospira spp. also increased with precipitation and during warm seasons. The occurrence of anti-Brucella spp. antibodies was higher on dairy farms and during the winter and summer. The host abundances limit values, from which farms are expected to be free of the studied pathogens, are reported. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Murine rodents maintain pathogens within farms, whereas other native species are likely dispersing pathogens among farms. Hence, we recommend preventing and controlling murines in farm dwellings and isolating farms from their surroundings to avoid contact with other wild mammals.

"Hantaviruses are comprised of tri-segmented negative sense single-stranded RNA, and are members of the Bunyaviridae family. Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are important zoonotic pathogens that can have severe adverse effects in humans. They are naturally maintained in specific reservoir hosts without inducing symptomatic infection. In humans, however, hantaviruses often cause two acute febrile diseases, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). In this paper, we review the epidemiology and epizootiology of hantavirus infections worldwide.

"Advances in Next Generation Sequencing technologies have enabled the generation of millions of sequences from microorganisms. However, distinguishing the sequence of a novel species from sequencing errors remains a technical challenge when the novel species is highly divergent from the closest known species. To solve such a problem, we developed a new method called Optimistic Protein Assembly from Reads (OPAR). This method is based on the assumption that protein sequences could be more conserved than the nucleotide sequences encoding them. By taking advantage of metagenomics, bioinformatics and conventional Sanger sequencing, our method successfully identified all coding regions of the mouse picobirnavirus for the first time. The salvaged sequences indicated that segment 1 of this virus was more divergent from its homologues in other Picobirnaviridae species than segment 2. For this reason, only segment 2 of mouse picobirnavirus has been detected in previous studies. OPAR web tool is available at http://bioinformatics.czc.hokudai.ac.jp/opar/.

"Andes hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, transmitted by Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, has no approved treatment, a case fatality rate of 35%, and documented person-to-person transmission. An Andes vaccine, highly needed for prevention, is in development. We aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding hantavirus disease and willingness to participate in a future Andes vaccine trials through a cross sectional face-to-face oral survey of a randomly selected adult sample from 2 rural communes in southern Chile. Human subjects approval was obtained from our institutional IRBs, and participants signed informed consent. We enrolled 319 subjects from Corral and 321 from Curarrehue; 98% had heard about hantavirus disease and its reservoir but only half knew about transmission, symptoms and prevention. Participants fear the disease but are only partially aware of their own risk. One third of participants reported presence of rodents inside their homes. Despite moderate confidence in their health system, most subjects perceived vaccines as beneficial, and 93% would accept an approved hantavirus vaccine. Half would agree to participate in a vaccine trial and 29% would allow their children to participate. Motivations to participate were mainly altruistic, while risk perception was the main reason for declining. Knowledge about hantavirus disease and prevention practices require reinforcement, and a vaccine trial seems feasible in these populations.

"Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a disease caused by Hantavirus, which are negative-sense RNA viruses in the family Bunyaviridae that are highly virulent to humans. Numerous factors modify risk of Hantavirus transmission and consequent HPS risk. Human-driven landscape change can foster transmission risk by increasing numbers of habitat generalist rodent species that serve as the principal reservoir host. Climate can also affect rodent population dynamics and Hantavirus survival, and a number of social factors can influence probability of HPS transmission to humans. Evaluating contributions of these factors to HPS risk may enable predictions of future outbreaks, and is critical to development of effective public health strategies. Here we rely on a Bayesian model to quantify associations between annual HPS incidence across the state of São Paulo, Brazil (1993-2012) and climate variables (annual precipitation, annual mean temperature), landscape structure metrics (proportion of native habitat cover, number of forest fragments, proportion of area planted with sugarcane), and social factors (number of men older than 14 years and Human Development Index). We built separate models for the main two biomes of the state (cerrado and Atlantic forest). In both biomes Hantavirus risk increased with proportion of land cultivated for sugarcane and HDI, but proportion of forest cover, annual mean temperature, and population at risk also showed positive relationships in the Atlantic forest. Our analysis provides the first evidence that social, landscape, and climate factors are associated with HPS incidence in the Neotropics. Our risk map can be used to support the adoption of preventive measures and optimize the allocation of resources to avoid disease propagation, especially in municipalities that show medium to high HPS risk (> 5% of risk), and aimed at sugarcane workers, minimizing the risk of future HPS outbreaks.

"• Half of the estimated 1500 human infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin. • As many zoonotic agents are uncommon in humans and, for a number, have been established as causes of laboratory-acquired infections, good communication with the clinical microbiology laboratory is essential. • Although the number of infectious agents potentially transmissible from a specific animal to humans may be great, many of these infections are limited geographically and need not be considered unless a bioterrorist event or the introduction of an infection to a new area is a possibility. • Bats are reservoirs for such emerging diseases as those caused by Nipah virus, Australian bat lyssavirus, the SARS coronavirus, and Ebola virus. While there are more rodent species than there are bat species, bats host more viral zoonoses per species than do rodents. • The majority of potential agents of bioterrorism are zoonotic.

"BACKGROUND: Madre de Dios is located in the southeastern Amazonian region of Peru. Rodents have been estimated to be the reservoirs for up to 50 % of emerging zoonotic pathogens, including a host of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. As part of a larger study involving both human and animal research, this study serves to obtain a broader understanding of the key challenges and concerns related to health and rodent-borne illnesses from the perspective of the people living in these communities. METHODS: We used a mixed methods approach, which comprised of 12 focus group discussions, 34 key informant interviews and the application of a survey (n = 522) in four communities along the Inter-Oceanic Highway (IOH) in Madre de Dios, Peru over a two-year period. RESULTS: Although 90 % of survey respondents answered that rodents can transmit diseases and had seen rodents in their homes and immediate surroundings, most could not name specific rodent-borne diseases and, when probed, described rodents as pests or nuisance animals, but were not concerned about acquiring illnesses from them. Key informant interview data suggests that there has been a perceived increase in the amount of rodents in the communities since the construction of the IOH, however this potential increase was not coupled with increased knowledge about diseases or perceived risks among these key informants. Health providers also mentioned a lack of diagnostic tools specific for rodent-borne illnesses. This may be related to the fact that although a common rodent-borne disease like leptospirosis is frequently detected in the region, it is not routinely and readily diagnosed, therefore the real burden of the disease and exposure risk can be underestimated. If rodent-borne diseases are not on the radar of health professionals, they may not consider presumptive treatment, which could result in unnecessary morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSION: Awareness of rodent-borne diseases is still lacking in the area, even among health care professionals within the communities, despite the known burden of diseases like leptospirosis. We expect to report further findings as we obtain more information from all the study components.

"Although based on very limited M and L segment sequences, Artybash virus (ARTV) was proposed previously as a unique hantavirus harbored by the Laxmann's shrew (Sorex caecutiens). To verify this conjecture, lung tissues from 68 Laxmann's shrews, captured during 2006 to 2014 in eastern Siberia, Russia, and Hokkaido, Japan, were analyzed for ARTV RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ARTV RNA was detected in six Laxmann's shrews. Pairwise alignment and comparison of partial- and full-length S, M, and L segment sequences from these Laxmann's shrews, as well as phylogenetic analyses, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods indicated that ARTV was distinct from other soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses and representative hantaviruses harbored by rodents, moles, and bats. Taxonomic identity of the ARTV-infected Laxmann's shrews was confirmed by full-length cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis. Our data indicate that the hantavirus previously known as Amga virus (MGAV) represents genetic variants of ARTV. Thus, the previously proposed designation of ARTV/MGAV should be replaced by ARTV.

"We use data collected on 18,1-ha live trapping grids monitored from 1994 through 2005 and on five of those grids through 2013 in the mesic northwestern US to illustrate the complexity of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus)/Sin Nombre virus (SNV) host-pathogen system. Important factors necessary to understand zoonotic disease ecology include those associated with distribution and population dynamics of reservoir species as well as infection dynamics. Results are based on more than 851,000 trap nights, 16,608 individual deer mice and 10,572 collected blood samples. Deer mice were distributed throughout every habitat we sampled and were present during every sampling period in all habitats except high altitude habitats over1900 m. Abundance varied greatly among locations with peak numbers occurring mostly during fall. However, peak rodent abundance occurred during fall, winter and spring during various years on three grids trapped 12 mo/yr. Prevalence of antibodies to SNV averaged 3.9% to 22.1% but no grids had mice with antibodies during every month. The maximum period without antibody-positive mice ranged from one month to 52 months, or even more at high altitude grids where deer mice were not always present. Months without antibody-positive mice were more prevalent during fall than spring. Population fluctuations were not synchronous over broad geographic areas and antibody prevalences were not well spatially consistent, differing greatly over short distances. We observed an apparently negative, but non-statistically significant relationship between average antibody prevalence and average deer mouse population abundance and a statistically significant positive relationship between the average number of antibody positive mice and average population abundance. We present data from which potential researchers can estimate the effort required to adequately describe the ecology of a rodent-borne viral system. We address different factors affecting population dynamics and hantavirus antibody prevalence and discuss the path to understanding a complex rodent-borne disease system as well as the obstacles in that path.

"Andes virus (ANDV) is a human-pathogenic hantavirus. Hantaviruses presumably initiate their mRNA synthesis by using cap structures derived from host cell mRNAs, a mechanism called cap-snatching. A signature for a cap-snatching endonuclease is present in the N terminus of hantavirus L proteins. In this study, we aimed to solve the atomic structure of the ANDV endonuclease and characterize its biochemical features. However, the wild-type protein was refractory to expression in Escherichia coli, presumably due to toxic enzyme activity. To circumvent this problem, we introduced attenuating mutations in the domain that were previously shown to enhance L protein expression in mammalian cells. Using this approach, 13 mutant proteins encompassing ANDV L protein residues 1-200 were successfully expressed and purified. Protein stability and nuclease activity of the mutants was analyzed and the crystal structure of one mutant was solved to a resolution of 2.4 Å. Shape in solution was determined by small angle X-ray scattering. The ANDV endonuclease showed structural similarities to related enzymes of orthobunya-, arena-, and orthomyxoviruses, but also differences such as elongated shape and positively charged patches surrounding the active site. The enzyme was dependent on manganese, which is bound to the active site, most efficiently cleaved single-stranded RNA substrates, did not cleave DNA, and could be inhibited by known endonuclease inhibitors. The atomic structure in conjunction with stability and activity data for the 13 mutant enzymes facilitated inference of structure-function relationships in the protein. In conclusion, we solved the structure of a hantavirus cap-snatching endonuclease, elucidated its catalytic properties, and present a highly active mutant form, which allows for inhibitor screening.

"This chapter covers Category C diseases and agents. These emerging diseases present a very unique challenge to public health officials and infectious disease specialists. Perhaps they have been with us for millions of years, lurking in a dark corner of the environment, waiting for an opportunity to jump from their natural cycle of transmission to a human host. Or they may represent something totally new. Regardless of their origin, an emerging disease pathogen must be characterized quickly by molecular biologists and microbiologists. The dynamics of disease transmission must be investigated by teams of epidemiologists. Treatment regimens must be formulated by clinicians working on the frontlines of the outbreak. Disease prevention strategies and risk communications must be quickly formulated by public health officials. Finally, media attention for emerging disease outbreaks forces government officials at all levels to address the problem with planning and preparedness activities aimed at preserving the health of the public. Specific examples explored in this chapter include Nipah virus, hantavirus, West Nile fever virus, and the coronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.

"BACKGROUND: Hotspot detection and characterization has played an increasing role in understanding the maintenance and transmission of zoonotic pathogens. Identifying the specific environmental factors (or their correlates) that influence reservoir host abundance help increase understanding of how pathogens are maintained in natural systems and are crucial to identifying disease risk. However, most recent studies are performed at macro-scale and describe broad temporal patterns of population abundances. Few have been conducted at a microscale over short time periods that better capture the dynamical patterns of key populations. These finer resolution studies may better define the likelihood of local pathogen persistence. This study characterizes the landscape distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of Oligoryzomys fulvescens (O. fulvescens), an important mammalian reservoir in Central America. METHODS: Information collected in a longitudinal study of rodent populations in the community of Agua Buena in Tonosí, Panama, between April 2006 and December 2009 was analyzed using non-spatial analyses (box plots) and explicit spatial statistical tests (correlograms, SADIE and LISA). A 90 node grid was built (raster format) to design a base map. The area between the nodes was 0.09 km(2) and the total study area was 6.43 km(2) (2.39 x 2.69 km). The temporal assessment dataset was divided into four periods for each year studied: the dry season, rainy season, and two months-long transitions between seasons (the months of April and December). RESULTS: There were heterogeneous patterns in the population densities and degrees of dispersion of O. fulvescens that varied across seasons and among years. The species typically was locally absent during the late transitional months of the season, and re-established locally in subsequent years. These populations re-occurred in the same area during the first three years but subsequently re-established further south in the final year of the study. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated local populations encompassed approximately 300-600 m. The borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats were sharply demarcated over short distances. CONCLUSION: Oligoryzomys fulvescens showed a well-defined spatial pattern that evolved over time, and led to a pattern of changing aggregation. Thus, hot spots of abundance showed a general shifting pattern that helps explain the intermittent risk from pathogens transmitted by this species. This variation was associated with seasonality, as well as anthropogenic pressures that occurred with agricultural activities. These factors help define the characteristics of the occurrence, timing, intensity and duration of synanthropic populations affected by human populations and, consequently, possible exposure that local human populations experience.

"Hantaviruses are the members of the family Bunyaviridae that are naturally maintained in the populations of small mammals, mostly rodents. Most of these viruses can easily infect humans through contact with aerosols or dust generated by contaminated animal waste products. Depending on the particular Hantavirus involved, human infection could result in either hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or in Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. In the past few years, clinical cases of the Hantavirus caused diseases have been on the rise. Understanding structure of the Hantavirus genome and the functions of the key viral proteins are critical for the therapeutic agents' research. This paper gives a brief overview of the current knowledge on the structure and properties of the Hantavirus nucleoprotein and the glycoproteins.

"Horizontal gene transfer from retroviruses to mammals is well documented and extensive, but is rare between unrelated viruses with distinct genome types. Three herpesviruses encode a gene with similarity to a retroviral superantigen gene (sag) of the unrelated mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). We uncover ancient retroviral sags in over 20 mammals to reconstruct their shared history with herpesviral sags, revealing that the acquisition is a convergent evolutionary event. A retrovirus circulating in South American primates over 10 million years ago was the source of sag in two monkey herpesviruses, and a different retrovirus was the source of sag in a Peruvian rodent herpesvirus. We further show through a timescaled phylogenetic analysis that a cross-species transmission of monkey herpesviruses occurred after the acquisition of sag. These results reveal that a diverse range of ancient sag-containing retroviruses independently donated sag twice from two separate lineages that are distinct from MMTV.

"Human pathogenic hantaviruses and arenaviruses are maintained in nature by persistent infection of rodent carrier populations. Several members of these virus groups can cause significant disease in humans that is generically termed viral hemorrhagic fever (HF) and is characterized as a febrile illness with an increased propensity to cause acute inflammation. Human interaction with rodent carrier populations leads to infection. Arenaviruses are also viewed as potential biological weapons threat agents. There is an increased interest in studying these viruses in animal models to gain a deeper understating not only of viral pathogenesis, but also for the evaluation of medical countermeasures (MCM) to mitigate disease threats. In this review, we examine current knowledge regarding animal models employed in the study of these viruses. We include analysis of infection models in natural reservoirs and also discuss the impact of strain heterogeneity on the susceptibility of animals to infection. This information should provide a comprehensive reference for those interested in the study of arenaviruses and hantaviruses not only for MCM development but also in the study of viral pathogenesis and the biology of these viruses in their natural reservoirs.

"BACKGROUND: Inthis study, the genetic substructure and morphology of the species Neusticomysmonticolus was evaluated. A nuclear marker and mitochondrial maker were used to examine phylogeographic structure and to estimategenetic distances. Two statistical measurement analyses were applied to morphological data. RESULTS: These data recovered two morphologically distinct phylogeographic groups corresponding to populations on the eastern and western slopes of the Andes. Further, these eastern and western Andean slope populations of N. monticolus are 8.5 % divergent using sequence data from cytochrome-b (0.8 % divergent in the interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein gene). CONCLUSIONS: Populationscurrently assigned to N.monticolus constitutea species complex. The name N.monticolus is here restricted to western Andean slope populations. Populations on the eastern slope of the Andes are assigned to a new species, to which the authors assign the name Neusticomys vossi sp.nov.

"Rickettsia typhi is the causal agent of murine typhus; a worldwide zoonotic and vector-borne infectious disease, commonly associated with the presence of domestic and wild rodents. Human cases of murine typhus in the state of Yucatán are frequent. However, there is no evidence of the presence of Rickettsia typhi in mammals or vectors in Yucatán. The presence of Rickettsia in rodents and their ectoparasites was evaluated in a small municipality of Yucatán using the conventional polymerase chain reaction technique and sequencing. The study only identified the presence of Rickettsia typhi in blood samples obtained from Rattus rattus and it reported, for the first time, the presence of R. felis in the flea Polygenis odiosus collected from Ototylomys phyllotis rodent. Additionally, Rickettsia felis was detected in the ectoparasite Ctenocephalides felis fleas parasitizing the wild rodent Peromyscus yucatanicus. This study's results contributed to a better knowledge of Rickettsia epidemiology in Yucatán.

"Andes hantavirus (ANDV) causes hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in Chile and is the only hantavirus for which person-to-person transmission has been proven. We describe an outbreak of 5 human cases of ANDV infection in which symptoms developed in 2 household contacts and 2 health care workers after exposure to the index case-patient. Results of an epidemiologic investigation and sequence analysis of the virus isolates support person-to-person transmission of ANDV for the 4 secondary case-patients, including nosocomial transmission for the 2 health care workers. Health care personnel who have direct contact with ANDV case-patients or their body fluids should take precautions to prevent transmission of the virus. In addition, because the incubation period of ANDV after environmental exposure is longer than that for person-to-person exposure, all persons exposed to a confirmed ANDV case-patient or with possible environmental exposure to the virus should be monitored for 42 days for clinical symptoms.
"
"Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is a rodent-borne disease with a high case-fatality rate that is caused by several New World hantaviruses. Each pathogenic hantavirus is naturally hosted by a principal rodent species without conspicuous disease and infection is persistent, perhaps for life. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are the natural reservoirs of Sin Nombre virus (SNV), the etiologic agent of most HCPS cases in North America. Deer mice remain infected despite a helper T cell response that leads to high-titer neutralizing antibodies. Deer mice are also susceptible to Andes hantavirus (ANDV), which causes most HCPS cases in South America; however, deer mice clear ANDV. We infected deer mice with SNV or ANDV to identify differences in host responses that might account for this differential outcome. SNV RNA levels were higher in the lungs but not different in the heart, spleen, or kidneys. Most ANDV-infected deer mice had seroconverted 14 days after inoculation, but none of the SNV-infected deer mice had. Examination of lymph node cell antigen recall responses identified elevated immune gene expression in deer mice infected with ANDV and suggested maturation toward a Th2 or T follicular helper phenotype in some ANDV-infected deer mice, including activation of the interleukin 4 (IL-4) pathway in T cells and B cells. These data suggest that the rate of maturation of the immune response is substantially higher and of greater magnitude during ANDV infection, and these differences may account for clearance of ANDV and persistence of SNV. IMPORTANCE: Hantaviruses persistently infect their reservoir rodent hosts without pathology. It is unknown how these viruses evade sterilizing immune responses in the reservoirs. We have determined that infection of the deer mouse with its homologous hantavirus, Sin Nombre virus, results in low levels of immune gene expression in antigen-stimulated lymph node cells and a poor antibody response. However, infection of deer mice with a heterologous hantavirus, Andes virus, results in a robust lymph node cell response, signatures of T and B cell maturation, and production of antibodies. These findings suggest that an early and aggressive immune response to hantaviruses may lead to clearance in a reservoir host and suggest that a modest immune response may be a component of hantavirus ecology.

"An estimated 2.3 million disability-adjusted life years are lost globally from leishmaniasis. In Peru's Amazon region, the department of Madre de Dios (MDD) rises above the rest of the country in terms of the annual incidence rates of human leishmaniasis. Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is the species most frequently responsible for the form of disease that results in tissue destruction of the nose and mouth. However, essentially nothing is known regarding the reservoirs of this vector-borne, zoonotic parasite in MDD. Wild rodents have been suspected, or proven, to be reservoirs of several Leishmania spp. in various ecosystems and countries. Additionally, people who live or work in forested terrain, especially those who are not regionally local and whose immune systems are thus naïve to the parasite, are at most risk for contracting L. (V.) braziliensis. Hence, the objective of this study was to collect tissues from wild rodents captured at several study sites along the Amazonian segment of the newly constructed Transoceanic Highway and to use molecular laboratory techniques to analyze samples for the presence of Leishmania parasites. Liver tissues were tested via polymerase chain reaction from a total of 217 rodents; bone marrow and skin biopsies (ear and tail) were also tested from a subset of these same animals. The most numerous rodent species captured and tested were Oligoryzomys microtis (40.7%), Hylaeamys perenensis (15.7%), and Proechimys spp. (12%). All samples were negative for Leishmania, implying that although incidental infections may occur, these abundant rodent species are unlikely to serve as primary reservoirs of L. (V.) braziliensis along the Transoceanic Highway in MDD. Therefore, although these rodent species may persist and even thrive in moderately altered landscapes, we did not find any evidence to suggest they pose a risk for L. (V.) braziliensis transmission to human inhabitants in this highly prevalent region.

"Since the recognition of hantavirus as the agent responsible for haemorrhagic fever in Eurasia in the 1970s and, 20 years later, the descovery of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the Americas, the genus Hantavirus has been continually described throughout the World in a variety of wild animals. The diversity of wild animals infected with hantaviruses has only recently come into focus as a result of expanded wildlife studies. The known reservoirs are more than 80, belonging to 51 species of rodents, 7 bats (order Chiroptera) and 20 shrews and moles (order Soricomorpha). More than 80 genetically related viruses have been classified within Hantavirus genus; 25 recognized as human pathogens responsible for a large spectrum of diseases in the Old and New World. In Brazil, where the diversity of mammals and especially rodents is considered one of the largest in the world, 9 hantavirus genotypes have been identified in 12 rodent species belonging to the genus Akodon, Calomys, Holochilus, Oligoryzomys, Oxymycterus, Necromys and Rattus. Considering the increasing number of animals that have been implicated as reservoirs of different hantaviruses, the understanding of this diversity is important for evaluating the risk of distinct hantavirus species as human pathogens.
"
"Hantaviruses are hosted by rodents, insectivores and bats. Several rodent-borne hantaviruses cause two diseases that share many features in humans, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Eurasia or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome in the Americas. It is thought that the immune response plays a significant contributory role in these diseases. However, in reservoir hosts that have been closely examined, little or no pathology occurs and infection is persistent despite evidence of adaptive immune responses. Because most hantavirus reservoirs are not model organisms, it is difficult to conduct meaningful experiments that might shed light on how the viruses evade sterilizing immune responses and why immunopathology does not occur. Despite these limitations, recent advances in instrumentation and bioinformatics will have a dramatic impact on understanding reservoir host responses to hantaviruses by employing a systems biology approach to identify important pathways that mediate virus/reservoir relationships.

"Rodents are well-recognized reservoirs of Leptospira, contributing to its maintenance in endemic areas and playing a role in the public health risk associated with the infection. This study sought to provide some insights into rodent populations from Chile and their Leptospira carriage. In total, 393 rodents were trapped in 177 households. Higher rodent counts were associated with year 2 of the study, rainfall, and number of rodent signs. There was an inverse correlation with the number of cats. The number of rodents was higher in villages compared with slums (rate ratio = 3.23) but modified by average household age. Eighty rodents (20.4%) tested positive for Leptospira: 19.7% on the farms, 25.9% in villages, and 12.3% in the slums. Prevalence was 22.5% in Mus musculus, 20.7% in Rattus rattus, 21.1% in wild rodents, and 10.3% in R. norvegicus. Seasonal and temporal effects were the major determinants of Leptospira infection in rodent populations.

"We investigated hantaviruses in rodents in the southern Amazon Basin of Peru and identified an Andes virus variant from Neacomys spinosus mice. This finding extends the known range of this virus in South America and the range of recognized hantaviruses in Peru. Further studies of the epizoology of hantaviruses in this region are warranted.
"
"Andes virus (ANDV) is highly pathogenic in humans and is the primary etiologic agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in South America. Case-fatality rates are as high as 50% and there are no approved vaccines or specific therapies for infection. Our laboratory has recently developed a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine that expressed the glycoproteins of Andes virus in place of the native VSV glycoprotein (G). This vaccine is highly efficacious in the Syrian hamster model of HCPS when given 28 days before challenge with ANDV, or when given around the time of challenge (peri-exposure), and even protects when administered post-exposure. Herein, we sought to test the durability of the immune response to a single dose of this vaccine in Syrian hamsters. This vaccine was efficacious in hamsters challenged intranasally with ANDV 6 months after vaccination (p = 0.025), but animals were not significantly protected following 1 year of vaccination (p = 0.090). The decrease in protection correlated with a reduction of measurable neutralizing antibody responses, and suggests that a more robust vaccination schedule might be required to provide long-term immunity.
"
"We use a Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) approach along with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques to examine the potential distribution of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) caused by Andes virus (ANDV) in southern Argentina and, more precisely, define and estimate the area with the highest infection probability for humans, through the combination with the distribution map for the competent rodent host (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus). Sites with confirmed cases of HPS in the period 1995-2009 were mostly concentrated in a narrow strip (~90 km × 900 km) along the Andes range from northern Neuquén to central Chubut province. This area is characterized by high mean annual precipitation (~1,000 mm on average), but dry summers (less than 100 mm), very low percentages of bare soil (~10% on average) and low temperatures in the coldest month (minimum average temperature -1.5 °C), as compared to the HPS-free areas, features that coincide with sub-Antarctic forests and shrublands (especially those dominated by the invasive plant Rosa rubiginosa), where rodent host abundances and ANDV prevalences are known to be the highest. Through the combination of predictive distribution maps of the reservoir host and disease cases, we found that the area with the highest probability for HPS to occur overlaps only 28% with the most suitable habitat for O. longicaudatus. With this approach, we made a step forward in the understanding of the risk factors that need to be considered in the forecasting and mapping of risk at the regional/national scale. We propose the implementation and use of thematic maps, such as the one built here, as a basic tool allowing public health authorities to focus surveillance efforts and normally scarce resources for prevention and control actions in vast areas like southern Argentina.

"Viruses have long been studied not only for their pathology and associated disease but also as model systems for understanding cellular and immunological processes. Rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP) is a recently characterized rhadinovirus related to murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) that establishes acute and latent infection in laboratory mice. RHVP encodes numerous unique proteins that we hypothesize might facilitate host immune evasion during infection. We report here that open reading frame (ORF) R17 encodes a high-affinity chemokine binding protein that broadly recognizes human and murine CC and C chemokines. The interaction of R17 with chemokines is generally characterized by rapid association kinetics, and in the case of CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL24, and XCL1, extremely stable complexes are formed. Functionally, R17 potently inhibited CCL2-driven chemotaxis of the human monocytic cell line THP-1, CCL3-driven chemotaxis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and CCL2-mediated calcium flux. Our studies also reveal that R17 binds to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in a process dependent upon two BBXB motifs and that chemokine and GAG binding can occur simultaneously at distinct sites. Collectively, these studies suggest that R17 may play a role in RHVP immune evasion through the targeted sabotage of chemokine-mediated immune surveillance.

"Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome is an emerging zoonosis in Brazil. Human infections occur via inhalation of aerosolized viral particles from excreta of infected wild rodents. Necromys lasiurus and Oligoryzomys nigripes appear to be the main reservoirs of hantavirus in the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes. We estimated and compared ecological niches of the two rodent species, and analyzed environmental factors influencing their occurrence, to understand the geography of hantavirus transmission. N. lasiurus showed a wide potential distribution in Brazil, in the Cerrado, Caatinga, and Atlantic Forest biomes. Highest climate suitability for O. nigripes was observed along the Brazilian Atlantic coast. Maximum temperature in the warmest months and annual precipitation were the variables that most influence the distributions of N. lasiurus and O. nigripes, respectively. Models based on occurrences of infected rodents estimated a broader area of risk for hantavirus transmission in southeastern and southern Brazil, coinciding with the distribution of human cases of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. We found no demonstrable environmental differences among occurrence sites for the rodents and for human cases of hantavirus. However, areas of northern and northeastern Brazil are also apparently suitable for the two species, without broad coincidence with human cases. Modeling of niches and distributions of rodent reservoirs indicates potential for transmission of hantavirus across virtually all of Brazil outside the Amazon Basin.

"In Panama, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is caused by Choclo virus, a species phylogenetically related to Andes and Maporal viruses. Up to 60% of the population has been positive for specific serum antibody in community-based surveys, but mortality is very uncommon. In four western Panama clinics, we tested individuals presenting with a severe febrile prodrome for acute hantavirus (HV) infection by immunoglobulin M enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction as well as clinically similar infections, such as dengue and leptospirosis. From 2006 to 2009, at least 21% of 117 patients diagnosed with HV infection had HV Fever (HF) with no evidence of pulmonary edema (no respiratory distress or radiographic lung infiltrates), and 44% of patients had very mild HPS (radiographic pulmonary edema but no respiratory insufficiency). HV infection caused by Choclo virus in Panama presents often as HF, which contrasts with HV in the Americas but is consistent with the high seroprevalence in endemic regions.

"Background. Transport of critically ill patients is a complex issue. We present a case using prone positioning as a bridge to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), performed by a critical retrieval team from a university hospital. Case Report. A 28-year-old male developed fever, progressive respiratory failure, and shock. He was admitted to ICU from a public hospital, and mechanical ventilation was begun, but clinical response was not adequate. ECMO was deemed necessary due to severe respiratory failure and severe shock. A critical retrieval team of our center was assembled to attempt transfer. Prone positioning was employed to stabilize and transfer the patient, after risk-benefit assessment. Once in our hospital, ECMO was useful to resolve shock and pulmonary edema secondary to Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Finally, he was discharged with normal functioning. Conclusion. This case exemplifies the relevance of a retrieval team and bridge therapy. Prone positioning improves oxygenation and is safe to perform as transport if performed by a trained team as in this case. Preparation and organization is necessary to improve outcomes, using teams and organized networks. Catastrophic respiratory failure and shock should not be contraindications to transferring patients, but it must be done with an experienced team.

"BACKGROUND: Hantavirus disease is a zoonosis of increasing clinical importance. A new incidence peak was reached in Germany in 2012, with more than 2800 reported cases. These viruses are transmitted from small mammals to human beings. The disease begins with high fever and non-pathognomonic manifestations that can end in shock and organ failure. METHODS: This article is based on a selective literature search, on the authors' experiences at the National Referral Laboratory for Hantavirus Infections (Nationales Konsiliarlaboratorium für Hantaviren), and on published recommendations from Germany and abroad. RESULTS: Two hantavirus species cause clinically relevant infections in Germany. Puumala virus, which is transmitted by bank voles, causes large outbreaks of disease every 2 to 3 years in the southwestern and western regions of Germany and in the Bavarian Forest. Dobrava-Belgrad virus, transmitted by striped field mice, causes infections in the north and east of the country. Serological tests are available for primary and confirmatory diagnosis; moreover, viral nucleic acids can be amplified in the early phase of illness and compared with the viral nucleic acids from the reservoir hosts of the corresponding type of infection. Infections with American types of hantavirus have ca. 35% case fatality, and hantaviruses from southeastern Europe and Asia are also highly pathogenic; in contrast, the febrile illnesses caused by hantaviruses in Germany are usually relatively mild. CONCLUSION: When persons living in high-risk areas present with fever of unknown origin or with renal dysfunction of unknown origin, physicians should consider the possibility of a hantavirus infection and should initiate the appropriate diagnostic evaluation.

"Vaccinia virus (VACV), the etiological agent of an exanthematic disease, has been associated with several bovine outbreaks in Brazil since the end of the global vaccination campaign against smallpox. It was previously believed that the vaccine virus used for the WHO global campaign had adapted to an unknown wild reservoir and was sporadically re-emerging in outbreaks in cattle and milkers. At present, it is known that Brazilian VACV is phylogenetically different from the vaccinia virus vaccinal strain, but its origin remains unknown. This study assessed the seroprevalence of orthopoxviruses in domestic and wild animals and farmers from 47 farms in three cities in the southwest region of the state of São Paulo with or without official reports of outbreaks in cattle or humans. Our data indicate a low seroprevalence of antibodies in wild animals and raise interesting questions about the real potential of wild rodents and marsupials as VACV reservoirs, suggesting other routes through which VACV can be spread.

"Little is known about the structure and function of the 250-kDa L protein of hantaviruses, although it plays a central role in virus genome transcription and replication. When attempting to study Andes virus (ANDV) L protein in mammalian cells, we encountered difficulties. Even in a strong overexpression system, ANDV L protein could not be detected by immunoblotting. Deletion analysis revealed that the 534 N-terminal amino acid residues determine the low-expression phenotype. Inhibition of translation due to RNA secondary structures around the start codon, rapid proteasomal degradation, and reduced half-life time were excluded. However, ANDV L protein expression could be rescued upon mutation of the catalytic PD-E-K motif and further conserved residues of the putative endonuclease at the N terminus of the protein. In addition, wild-type ANDV L rather than expressible L mutants suppressed the level of L mRNA, as well as reporter mRNAs. Wild-type L protein also reduced the synthesis of cellular proteins in the high-molecular-weight range. Using expressible ANDV L mutants as a tool for localization studies, we show that L protein colocalizes with ANDV N and NSs but not Gc protein. A fraction of L protein also colocalized with the cellular processing (P) body component DCP1a. Overall, these data suggest that ANDV L protein possesses a highly active endonuclease at the N terminus suppressing the level of its own as well as heterologous mRNAs upon recombinant expression in mammalian cells.

"Zoonotic pathogens are significant burdens on global public health. Because they are transmitted to humans from non-human animals, the transmission dynamics of zoonoses are necessarily influenced by the ecology of their animal hosts and vectors. The 'dilution effect' proposes that increased species diversity reduces disease risk, suggesting that conservation and public health initiatives can work synergistically to improve human health and wildlife biodiversity. However, the meta-analysis that we present here indicates a weak and highly heterogeneous relationship between host biodiversity and disease. Our results suggest that disease risk is more likely a local phenomenon that relies on the specific composition of reservoir hosts and vectors, and their ecology, rather than patterns of species biodiversity.
"
"Because their distribution usually depends on the presence of more than one species, modelling zoonotic diseases in humans differs from modelling individual species distribution even though the data are similar in nature. Three approaches can be used to model spatial distributions recorded by points: based on presence/absence, presence/available or presence data. Here, we compared one or two of several existing methods for each of these approaches. Human cases of hantavirus infection reported by place of infection between 1991 and 1998 in Sweden were used as a case study. Puumala virus (PUUV), the most common hantavirus in Europe, circulates among bank voles (Myodes glareolus). In northern Sweden, it causes nephropathia epidemica (NE) in humans, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome.Logistic binomial regression and boosted regression trees were used to model presence and absence data. Presence and available sites (where the disease may occur) were modelled using cross-validated logistic regression. Finally, the ecological niche model MaxEnt, based on presence-only data, was used.In our study, logistic regression had the best predictive power, followed by boosted regression trees, MaxEnt and cross-validated logistic regression. It is also the most statistically reliable but requires absence data. The cross-validated method partly avoids the issue of absence data but requires fastidious calculations. MaxEnt accounts for non-linear responses but the estimators can be complex. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are reviewed.

"Infectious diseases are a major global public health problem. Multiple agents are now recognized to cause indistinguishable illnesses. The term 'syndrome' applies to such situations, for which early and rapid diagnosis of the infecting agent would enable prompt and appropriate therapy. Public health physicians would also get timely information on the specific etiology of the infectious syndrome, facilitating intervention at the community level in the face of outbreaks or epidemics. A variety of molecular techniques have been evaluated for rapid diagnosis of infectious syndromes. These techniques include real-time multiplex PCR, DNA microarray, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and other similar assays. This review surveys such state-of-the-art technologies.

"To better describe the genetic diversity of hantaviruses associated with human illness in South America, we screened blood samples from febrile patients in Chapare Province in central Bolivia during 2008-2009 for recent hantavirus infection. Hantavirus RNA was detected in 3 patients, including 1 who died. Partial RNA sequences of small and medium segments from the 3 patients were most closely related to Andes virus lineages but distinct (<90% nt identity) from reported strains. A survey for IgG against hantaviruses among residents of Chapare Province indicated that 12.2% of the population had past exposure to >1 hantaviruses; the highest prevalence was among agricultural workers. Because of the high level of human exposure to hantavirus strains and the severity of resulting disease, additional studies are warranted to determine the reservoirs, ecologic range, and public health effect of this novel strain of hantavirus.

"We report the first complete genome sequence of Maripa virus identified in 2009 from a patient with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in French Guiana. Maripa virus corresponds to a new variant of the Rio Mamoré virus species in the Bunyaviridae family, genus Hantavirus.

"Alphaviruses are responsible for several medically important emerging diseases and are also significant veterinary pathogens. Due to the aerosol infectivity of some alphaviruses and their ability to cause severe, sometimes fatal neurologic diseases, they are also of biodefense importance. This review discusses the ecology, epidemiology and molecular virology of the alphaviruses, then focuses on three of the most important members of the genus: Venezuelan and eastern equine encephalitis and chikungunya viruses, with emphasis on their genetics and emergence mechanisms, and how current knowledge as well as gaps influence our ability to detect and determine the source of both natural outbreaks and potential use for bioterrorism. This article is one of a series in Antiviral Research on the genetic diversity of emerging viruses.

"In recent studies, the nuclear domain 10 (ND10) components PML, Sp100, human Daxx (hDaxx), and ATRX were identified to be cellular restriction factors that are able to inhibit the replication of several herpesviruses. The antiviral function of ND10, however, is antagonized by viral effector proteins by a variety of strategies, including degradation of PML or relocalization of ND10 proteins. In this study, we analyzed the interplay between infection with herpesvirus saimiri (HVS), the prototypic rhadinovirus, and cellular defense by ND10. In contrast to other herpesviruses, we found that HVS specifically degraded the cellular ND10 component Sp100, whereas other factors like PML or hDaxx remained intact. We could further identify the ORF3 tegument protein of HVS, which shares homology with the cellular formylglycinamide ribotide amidotransferase (FGARAT) enzyme, to be the viral factor that induces the proteasomal degradation of Sp100. Interestingly, recent studies showed that the ORF3-homologous proteins ORF75c of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 and BNRF-1 of Epstein-Barr virus modulate the ND10 proteins PML and ATRX, respectively, suggesting that the ND10 targets of viral FGARAT-homologous proteins diversified during evolution. Furthermore, a virus with the ORF3 deletion was efficiently complemented in Sp100-depleted cells, indicating that Sp100 is able to inhibit HVS in the absence of antagonistic mechanisms. In contrast, we observed that PML, which was neither degraded nor redistributed after HVS infection, strongly restricted both wild-type HVS and virus with the ORF3 deletion. Thus, HVS may lack a factor that efficiently counteracts the repressive function of PML, which may foster latency as the outcome of infection.

"The long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus (Sigmodontinae), the major reservoir of Hantavirus in Chile and Patagonian Argentina, is widely distributed in the Mediterranean, Temperate and Patagonian Forests of Chile, as well as in adjacent areas in southern Argentina. We used molecular data to evaluate the effects of the last glacial event on the phylogeographic structure of this species. We examined if historical Pleistocene events had affected genetic variation and spatial distribution of this species along its distributional range. We sampled 223 individuals representing 47 localities along the species range, and sequenced the hypervariable domain I of the mtDNA control region. Aligned sequences were analyzed using haplotype network, bayesian population structure and demographic analyses. Analysis of population structure and the haplotype network inferred three genetic clusters along the distribution of O. longicaudatus that mostly agreed with the three major ecogeographic regions in Chile: Mediterranean, Temperate Forests and Patagonian Forests. Bayesian Skyline Plots showed constant population sizes through time in all three clusters followed by an increase after and during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; between 26,000-13,000 years ago). Neutrality tests and the ""g"" parameter also suggest that populations of O. longicaudatus experienced demographic expansion across the species entire range. Past climate shifts have influenced population structure and lineage variation of O. longicaudatus. This species remained in refugia areas during Pleistocene times in southern Temperate Forests (and adjacent areas in Patagonia). From these refugia, O. longicaudatus experienced demographic expansions into Patagonian Forests and central Mediterranean Chile using glacial retreats.

"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe respiratory illness identified in 1993. Since its identification, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has obtained standardized information about and maintained a registry of all laboratory-confirmed HPS cases in the United States. During 1993-2009, a total of 510 HPS cases were identified. Case counts have varied from 11 to 48 per year (case-fatality rate 35%). However, there were no trends suggesting increasing or decreasing case counts or fatality rates. Although cases were reported in 30 states, most cases occurred in the western half of the country; annual case counts varied most in the southwestern United States. Increased hematocrits, leukocyte counts, and creatinine levels were more common in HPS case-patients who died. HPS is a severe disease with a high case-fatality rate, and cases continue to occur. The greatest potential for high annual HPS incidence exists in the southwestern United States.

"Hantaviruses are emerging viruses which are hosted by small mammals. When transmitted to humans, they can cause two clinical syndromes, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. The review compiles the current list of hantaviruses which are thought to be pathogenic in humans on the basis of molecular or at least serological evidence. Whereas induction of a neutralizing humoral immune response is considered to be protective against infection, the dual role of cellular immunity (protection versus immunopathogenicity) is discussed. For active immunisation, inactivated virus vaccines are licensed in certain Asian countries. Moreover, several classical and molecular vaccine approaches are in pre-clinical stages of development. The development of hantavirus vaccines is hampered by the lack of adequate animal models of hantavirus-associated disease. In addition to active immunization strategies, the review summarizes other ways of infection prevention, as passive immunization, chemoprophylaxis, and exposition prophylaxis.

"BACKGROUND: Pathogenic hantaviruses geographically distributed in the Old World cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), whereas New World hantaviruses are the aetiological agents of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). Ribavirin, a drug associated with toxicities, is presently indicated for treatment of HFRS, whereas treatment of the more frequently lethal HCPS is limited to supportive care. Because of the need for safe and effective antivirals to treat severe hantaviral infections, we evaluated favipiravir (T-705) against Dobrava and Maporal viruses as representative Old World and New World hantaviruses, respectively. Dobrava virus causes HFRS in Europe. Maporal virus (MPRLV), recently isolated from western Venezuela, is phylogenetically similar to Andes virus, the principal cause of HCPS in Argentina. METHODS: Hantavirus replication in the presence of various inhibitors was measured by focus-forming unit assays and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed by the neighbour-joining and bootstrap consensus methods. RESULTS: Here, we show that infection of Vero E6 cells with MPRLV is dependent on β3 integrins, similar to that reported for pathogenic hantaviruses. Furthermore, by analysis of molecular determinants associated with the G1 glycoprotein cytoplasmic tail, we show the close genetic proximity of MPRLV to other HCPS-causing hantaviruses in these regions predictive of pathogenicity. We also demonstrate anti-hantavirus activity by favipiravir with inhibitory concentrations ranging from 65 to 93 μM and selectivity indices>50. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that MPRLV may serve as a safer alternative to modelling infection caused by the highly lethal Andes virus and that hantaviruses are sensitive to the effects of favipiravir in cell culture.

"Most emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, yet recent commissions have highlighted deficiencies in their surveillance. We conducted a survey to understand the needs of state agencies for zoonotic disease surveillance. The findings will hopefully support the development of biomedical informatics applications that can link animal and human data for surveillance.
"
"The continued emergence and re-emergence of pathogens represent an ongoing, sometimes major, threat to populations. Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae) and their associated human diseases were considered to be confined to Eurasia, but the occurrence of an outbreak in 1993-94 in the southwestern United States led to a great increase in their study among virologists worldwide. Well over 40 hantaviral genotypes have been described, the large majority since 1993, and nearly half of them pathogenic for humans. Hantaviruses cause persistent infections in their reservoir hosts, and in the Americas, human disease is manifest as a cardiopulmonary compromise, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), with case-fatality ratios, for the most common viral serotypes, between 30% and 40%. Habitat disturbance and larger-scale ecological disturbances, perhaps including climate change, are among the factors that may have increased the human caseload of HCPS between 1993 and the present. We consider here the features that influence the structure of host population dynamics that may lead to viral outbreaks, as well as the macromolecular determinants of hantaviruses that have been regarded as having potential contribution to pathogenicity.
"
"Hantaviruses are enzootic viruses that maintain persistent infections in their rodent hosts without apparent disease symptoms. The spillover of these viruses to humans can lead to one of two serious illnesses, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In recent years, there has been an improved understanding of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and natural history of these viruses following an increase in the number of outbreaks in the Americas. In this review, current concepts regarding the ecology of and disease associated with these serious human pathogens are presented. Priorities for future research suggest an integration of the ecology and evolution of these and other host-virus ecosystems through modeling and hypothesis-driven research with the risk of emergence, host switching/spillover, and disease transmission to humans.
"
"Sin Nombre virus (SNV), Andes virus (ANDV), and Laguna Negra virus (LANV) have been known as the dominant causative agents of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). ANDV and LANV, with different patterns of pathogenicity, exist in a sympatric relationship. Moreover, there is documented evidence of person-to-person transmission of ANDV. Therefore, it is important in clinical medicine and epidemiology to know the serotype of a hantavirus causing infection. Truncated SNV, ANDV, and LANV recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (trNs) missing 99 N-terminal amino acids (trN100) were expressed using a baculovirus system, and their applicability for serotyping SNV, ANDV, and LANV infection by the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) was examined. HPS patient sera and natural-reservoir rodent sera infected with SNV, ANDV, and LANV showed the highest optical density (OD) values for homologous trN100 antigens. Since even patient sera with lower IgM and IgG antibody titers were serotyped, the trN100s are therefore considered useful for serotyping with early-acute-phase sera. In contrast, assays testing whole recombinant nucleocapsid protein antigens of SNV, ANDV, and LANV expressed in Escherichia coli detected homologous and heterologous antibodies equally. These results indicated that a screening ELISA using an E. coli-expressed antigen followed by a serotyping ELISA using trN100s is useful for epidemiological surveillance in regions where two or more hantavirus species cocirculate.

"Hantaviruses affect people worldwide, yet they remain poorly understood. This article explores the known history of hantaviruses. It describes diagnostic methods and potential options for treatment and prevention.
"
"Recent identification of a newfound hantavirus, designated Seewis virus (SWSV), in the Eurasian common shrew (Sorex araneus), captured in Switzerland, corroborates decades-old reports of hantaviral antigens in this shrew species from Russia. To ascertain the spatial or geographic variation of SWSV, archival liver tissues from 88 Eurasian common shrews, trapped in Finland in 1982 and in Hungary during 1997, 1999 and 2000, were analyzed for hantavirus RNAs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. SWSV RNAs were detected in 12 of 22 (54.5%) and 13 of 66 (19.7%) Eurasian common shrews from Finland and Hungary, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of S- and L-segment sequences of SWSV strains, using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods, revealed geographic-specific genetic variation, similar to the phylogeography of rodent-borne hantaviruses, suggesting long-standing hantavirus-host co-evolutionary adaptation.
"
"Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is an emerging infectious disease first reported in Chile in 1995. Andes hantavirus (ANDV) is responsible for the more than 500 cases of HCPS reported in Chile. Previous work showed that ANDV is genetically differentiated in Chile across contrasting landscapes. To determine whether the reservoir rodent (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) populations are also geographically segregated, we conducted range-wide spatial genetic analyses of O. longicaudatus in Chile using the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene. Given that landscape structure influences the incidence of hantavirus infections, we also tested 772 O. longicaudatus specimens for antibodies to ANDV captured during the period 2000-2006. Population genetic analyses of O. longicaudatus are largely congruent with those reported for ANDV, with the host primarily differentiated according to three defined ecoregions, Mediterranean, Valdivian rain forest and North Patagonian rain forest. Significant differences in the relative prevalence of anti-ANDV antibodies in rodent samples also were found across the three ecoregions. We relate these results to the number of reported human HCPS cases in Chile, and discuss the importance of landscape differences in light of ANDV transmission to humans and among rodent populations.
"
"New habitat-based models for spread of hantavirus are developed which account for interspecies interaction. Existing habitat-based models do not consider interspecies pathogen transmission, a primary route for emergence of new infectious diseases and reservoirs in wildlife and man. The modeling of interspecies transmission has the potential to provide more accurate predictions of disease persistence and emergence dynamics. The new models are motivated by our recent work on hantavirus in rodent communities in Paraguay. Our Paraguayan data illustrate the spatial and temporal overlaps among rodent species, one of which is the reservoir species for Jabora virus and others which are spillover species. Disease transmission occurs when their habitats overlap. Two mathematical models, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model, are developed for spread of hantavirus between a reservoir and a spillover species. Analysis of a special case of the ODE model provides an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, R(0), such that if R(0)<1, then the pathogen does not persist in either population but if R(0)>1, pathogen outbreaks or persistence may occur. Numerical simulations of the CTMC model display sporadic disease incidence, a new behavior of our habitat-based model, not present in other models, but which is a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay. Environmental changes that result in greater habitat overlap result in more encounters among various species that may lead to pathogen outbreaks and pathogen establishment in a new host.
"
"BACKGROUND: Oligoryzomys longicaudatus (colilargo) is the rodent responsible for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in Argentine Patagonia. In past decades (1967-1998), trends of precipitation reduction and surface air temperature increase have been observed in western Patagonia. We explore how the potential distribution of the hantavirus reservoir would change under different climate change scenarios based on the observed trends. METHODS: Four scenarios of potential climate change were constructed using temperature and precipitation changes observed in Argentine Patagonia between 1967 and 1998: Scenario 1 assumed no change in precipitation but a temperature trend as observed; scenario 2 assumed no changes in temperature but a precipitation trend as observed; Scenario 3 included changes in both temperature and precipitation trends as observed; Scenario 4 assumed changes in both temperature and precipitation trends as observed but doubled. We used a validated spatial distribution model of O. longicaudatus as a function of temperature and precipitation. From the model probability of the rodent presence was calculated for each scenario. RESULTS: If changes in precipitation follow previous trends, the probability of the colilargo presence would fall in the HPS transmission zone of northern Patagonia. If temperature and precipitation trends remain at current levels for 60 years or double in the future 30 years, the probability of the rodent presence and the associated total area of potential distribution would diminish throughout Patagonia; the areas of potential distribution for colilargos would shift eastwards. These results suggest that future changes in Patagonia climate may lower transmission risk through a reduction in the potential distribution of the rodent reservoir. CONCLUSION: According to our model the rates of temperature and precipitation changes observed between 1967 and 1998 may produce significant changes in the rodent distribution in an equivalent period of time only in certain areas. Given that changes maintain for 60 years or double in 30 years, the hantavirus reservoir Oligoryzomys longicaudatus may contract its distribution in Argentine Patagonia extensively.

"A genetically distinct hantavirus, designated Oxbow virus (OXBV), was detected in tissues of an American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii), captured in Gresham, Oregon, in September 2003. Pairwise analysis of full-length S- and M- and partial L-segment nucleotide and amino acid sequences of OXBV indicated low sequence similarity with rodent-borne hantaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods, and host-parasite evolutionary comparisons, showed that OXBV and Asama virus, a hantavirus recently identified from the Japanese shrew mole (Urotrichus talpoides), were related to soricine shrew-borne hantaviruses from North America and Eurasia, respectively, suggesting parallel evolution associated with cross-species transmission.

"Leptospirosis has been reported in rural areas of Brazil. However, there is limited information about the exposure risk or the risk of Leptospira infection for rural-based populations. A cross-sectional study was carried out in order to determine the prevalence and risk factors for prior Leptospira infection in a rural subsistence farming region of the state of Rio Grande do Norte, an area in which outbreaks of leptospirosis have occurred. Among 290 individuals enrolled, 44 (15.2%) had anti-Leptospira IgM antibodies as determined by IgM ELISA. Infection tended to occur with activities related to the rice fields (P=0.08). Our findings indicate that Leptospira infection occurs even in years of low rainfall, and may have an important impact among poor rural-based subsistence farmers in Brazil. Additional studies are needed to characterize the mode of transmission in this region.
"
"Among the emerging viruses, hantaviruses are being focused on more and more due to their increasing number and worldwide distribution. Transmission occurs via inhalation of aerosolized infected rodent excreta. The symptoms and course of disease vary with the infecting hantavirus species. The distribution of the different hantavirus species correlates with the geographical distribution of the virus-type-specific rodent host. Hantaviruses in Europe and Asia cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Infection with Puumala, the prevalent virus type in Germany, results in a more moderate form of HFRS, nephropathia epidemica. Infections with virus species on the American continents lead to a clinical picture with predominantly pulmonary pathology (hantaviral pulmonary syndrome). No specific antiviral therapy or approved vaccines are available for any hantavirus species. Controlling the rodent populations and avoiding contact with rodent excrement are the only measures that can be undertaken to contain and prevent infection.
"
"Recently, we reported the discovery of several potential rodent reservoirs of hantaviruses in western (Holochilus chacarius) and eastern Paraguay (Akodon montensis, Oligoryzomys chacoensis, and O. nigripes). Comparisons of the hantavirus S- and M-segments amplified from these four rodents revealed significant differences from each another and from other South American hantaviruses. The ALP strain from the semiarid Chaco ecoregion clustered with Leguna Negra and Rio Mamore (LN/RM), whereas the BMJ-NEB strain from the more humid lower Chaco ecoregion formed a clade with Oran and Bermejo. The other two strains, AAI and IP37/38, were distinct from known hantaviruses. With respect to the S-segment sequence, AAI from eastern Paraguay formed a clade with ALP/LN/RM, but its M-segment clustered with Pergamino and Maciel, suggesting a possible reassortment. AAI was found in areas experiencing rapid land cover fragmentation and change within the Interior Atlantic Forest. IP37/38 did not show any strong association with any of the known hantavirus strains.
"
"The potential incubation period from exposure to onset of symptoms was 7-39 days (median 18 days) in 20 patients with a defined period of exposure to Andes virus in a high-risk area. This period was 14-32 days (median 18 days) in 11 patients with exposure for <48 hours.
"
"Viral studies have historically approached their phylogenetic analysis without consideration of the impact of the role the host plays in evolution. Our study examines host/viral interactions through analysis of the phylogenetic relationship between hantavirus genetic sequences and host cytochrome B sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of known Hantavirus genetic sequences were performed using PAUP 3.1.1 (vers. 4.0.0d64). Only sequences available through GENBANK were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis of hantavirus sequences revealed distinct patterns based upon geographic area. These patterns coincided with the known ranges of reservoir hosts. Multiple hosts for individual viruses and multiple viruses in a single host species for hantaviruses have been described. This may be due to accidental exposure, host-switching, co-speciation, or broad co-accommodation. Since the host is the actual environment that the virus survives in, changes in the host over time could potentially directly influence changes in the virus. Multiple viruses and hosts collide in Southeastern Europe increasing the prospect of finding distinct viral/host relationships. Rodent Cytochrome B is very well conserved and can be used to tract host lineage. By tracking the relationship of infected hosts, we theorize that patterns in host DNA will emerge that will mirror patterns in viral sequences. This analysis of the host DNA could provide an understanding into the causes of variation in hantaviral sequences, pathogenicity, transmissibility, infectivity, viral range and expand our knowledge of viral/host interactions. Surveillance for viruses in the field should include analysis of the host DNA in combination with the viral analysis.
"
"Two suspected hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases from Bolivia occurred in May and July 2000 and were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-ANDES using N-Andes recombinant antigen serology. Clot RNAs from the two patients were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing. We describe two characterized cases of HPS. One was caused by infection with Bermejo virus and the other with Andes Nort viral lineage, both previously obtained from Oligoryzomys species. This is the first report of molecular identification of a human hantavirus associated with Bermejo virus.
"
"Nucleotide sequences were determined for the complete S genome segments of the six distinct hantavirus genotypes from Argentina and for two cell culture-isolated Andes virus strains from Chile. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that, although divergent from each other, all Argentinian hantavirus genotypes group together and form a novel phylogenetic clade with the Andes virus. The previously characterized South American hantaviruses Laguna Negra virus and Rio Mamore virus make up another clade that originates from the same ancestral node as the Argentinian/Chilean viruses. Within the clade of Argentinian/Chilean viruses, three subclades can be defined, although the branching order is somewhat obscure. These are made of (i) ""Lechiguanas-like"" virus genotypes, (ii) Maciel virus and Pergamino virus genotypes, and (iii) strains of the Andes virus. Two hantavirus genotypes from Brazil, Araraquara and Castello dos Sonhos, were found to group with Maciel virus and Andes virus, respectively. The nucleocapsid protein amino acid sequence variability among the members of the Argentinian/Chilean clade does not exceed 5.8%. It is especially low (3.5%) among oryzomyine species-associated virus genotypes, suggesting recent divergence from the common ancestor. Interestingly, the Maciel and Pergamino viruses fit well with the rest of the clade although their hosts are akodontine rodents. Taken together, these data suggest that under conditions in which potential hosts display a high level of genetic diversity and are sympatric, host switching may play a prominent role in establishing hantavirus genetic diversity. However, cospeciation still remains the dominant factor in the evolution of hantaviruses.
"
"The 1993 outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the southwestern United States was associated with Sin Nombre virus, a rodent-borne hantavirus; The virus' primary reservoir is the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Hantavirus-infected rodents were identified in various regions of North America. An extensive nucleotide sequence database of an 139 bp fragment amplified from virus M genomic segments was generated. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that SNV-like hantaviruses are widely distributed in Peromyscus species rodents throughout North America. Classic SNV is the major cause of HPS in North America, but other Peromyscine-borne hantaviruses, e.g., New York and Monongahela viruses, are also associated with HPS cases. Although genetically diverse, SNV-like viruses have slowly coevolved with their rodent hosts. We show that the genetic relationships of hantaviruses in the Americas are complex, most likely as a result of the rapid radiation and speciation of New World sigmodontine rodents and occasional virus-host switching events.

"In 1996, investigation of a hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) outbreak in southern Argentina found evidence of person-to-person transmission of a hantavirus. The infection control ramifications of this finding led to this review of hantavirus epidemiology in the United States; the review suggests that Sin Nombre virus infection is rarely, if ever, transmitted from person to person and that existing guidelines for prevention of HPS remain appropriate for North America.

"Hantaviruses are carried by numerous rodent species throughout the world. In 1993, a previously unknown group of hantaviruses emerged in the United States as the cause of an acute respiratory disease now termed hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Before than, hantaviruses were known as the etiologic agents of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, a disease that occurs almost entirely in the Eastern Hemisphere. Since the discovery of the HPS-causing hantaviruses, intense investigation of the ecology and epidemiology of hantaviruses has led to the discovery of many other novel hantaviruses. Their ubiquity and potential for causing severe human illness make these viruses an important public health concern; we reviewed the distribution, ecology, disease potential, and genetic spectrum.

"Binocular disparity, the difference between the two eyes' images, is a powerful cue to generate the 3D depth percept known as stereopsis. In primates, binocular disparity is processed in multiple areas of the visual cortex, with distinct contributions of higher areas to specific aspects of depth perception. Mice, too, can perceive stereoscopic depth, and neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher-order, lateromedial (LM) and rostrolateral (RL) areas were found to be sensitive to binocular disparity. A detailed characterization of disparity tuning across mouse visual areas is lacking, however, and acquiring such data might help clarifying the role of higher areas for disparity processing and establishing putative functional correspondences to primate areas. We used two-photon calcium imaging in female mice to characterize the disparity tuning properties of neurons in visual areas V1, LM, and RL in response to dichoptically presented binocular gratings, as well as random dot correlograms (RDC). In all three areas, many neurons were tuned to disparity, showing strong response facilitation or suppression at optimal or null disparity, respectively, even in neurons classified as monocular by conventional ocular dominance (OD) measurements. Neurons in higher areas exhibited broader and more asymmetric disparity tuning curves compared with V1, as observed in primate visual cortex. Finally, we probed neurons' sensitivity to true stereo correspondence by comparing responses to correlated RDC (cRDC) and anticorrelated RDC (aRDC). Area LM, akin to primate ventral visual stream areas, showed higher selectivity for correlated stimuli and reduced anticorrelated responses, indicating higher-level disparity processing in LM compared with V1 and RL.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A major cue for inferring 3D depth is disparity between the two eyes' images. Investigating how binocular disparity is processed in the mouse visual system will not only help delineating the role of mouse higher areas for visual processing, but also shed light on how the mammalian brain computes stereopsis. We found that binocular integration is a prominent feature of mouse visual cortex, as many neurons are selectively and strongly modulated by binocular disparity. Comparison of responses to correlated and anticorrelated random dot correlograms (RDC) revealed that lateromedial area (LM) is more selective to correlated stimuli, while less sensitive to anticorrelated stimuli compared with primary visual cortex (V1) and rostrolateral area (RL), suggesting higher-level disparity processing in LM, resembling primate ventral visual stream areas.

"Yersinia pestis, the bacterial causative agent of plague, remains an important threat to human health. Plague is a rodent-borne disease that has historically shown an outstanding ability to colonize and persist across different species, habitats, and environments while provoking sporadic cases, outbreaks, and deadly global epidemics among humans. Between September and November 2017, an outbreak of urban pneumonic plague was declared in Madagascar, which refocused the attention of the scientific community on this ancient human scourge. Given recent trends and plague's resilience to control in the wild, its high fatality rate in humans without early treatment, and its capacity to disrupt social and healthcare systems, human plague should be considered as a neglected threat. A workshop was held in Paris in July 2018 to review current knowledge about plague and to identify the scientific research priorities to eradicate plague as a human threat. It was concluded that an urgent commitment is needed to develop and fund a strong research agenda aiming to fill the current knowledge gaps structured around 4 main axes: (i) an improved understanding of the ecological interactions among the reservoir, vector, pathogen, and environment; (ii) human and societal responses; (iii) improved diagnostic tools and case management; and (iv) vaccine development. These axes should be cross-cutting, translational, and focused on delivering context-specific strategies. Results of this research should feed a global control and prevention strategy within a ""One Health"" approach.

"Detection methods for Demodex musculi were historically unreliable, and testing was rarely performed because its prevalence in laboratory mice was underestimated. Although infestations are unapparent in most mouse strains, D. musculi burdens are higher and clinical signs detected in various immunodeficient strains. The parasite's influence on the immune system of immunocompetent mice is unknown. We characterized mite burden (immunocompetent and immunodeficient strains) and immunologic changes (immunocompetent strains only) in naïve Swiss Webster (SW; outbred), C57BL/6NCrl (B6; Th1 responder), BALB/cAnNCrl (BALB/c; Th2 responder) and NOD. Cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rg(tm1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG; immunodeficient) mice after exposure to Demodex-infested NSG mice. Infested and uninfested age-matched mice of each strain (n = 5) were euthanized 14, 28, 56, and 112 d after exposure. Mite burden was determined through PCR analysis and skin histopathology; B-cell and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell counts and activation states (CD25 and CD69) were evaluated by using flow cytometry; CBC counts were performed; and serum IgE levels were measured by ELISA. Mite burden and PCR copy number correlated in NSG mice, which had the highest mite burden, but not in immunocompetent strains. Infested immunocompetent animals developed diffuse alopecia by day 112, and both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice had significantly increased IgE levels. These findings aligned with the skewed Th1 or Th2 immunophenotype of each strain. BALB/c mice mounted the most effective host response, resulting in the lowest mite burden of all immunocompetent strains at 112 d after infestation without treatment. Clinically significant hematologic abnormalities were absent and immunophenotype was unaltered in immunocompetent animals. Topical treat- ment with imidacloprid-moxidectin (weekly for 8 wk) was effective at eradicating mites by early as 7 d after treatment. IgE levels decreased substantially in infested BALB/c mice after treatment. These findings demonstrate a need for D. musculi surveillance in mouse colonies, because the infestation may influence the use of infested mice in select studies.

"The evolution of mankind has constantly been influenced by the pathogens encountered. The various populations of modern humans that ventured out of Africa adapted to different environments and faced a large variety of infectious agents, resulting in local adaptations of the immune system for these populations. The functional variation of immune genes as a result of evolution is relevant in the responses against infection, as well as in the emergence of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases observed in modern populations. Understanding how host-pathogen interactions have influenced the human immune system from an evolutionary perspective might contribute to unveiling the causes behind different immune-mediated disorders and promote the development of new strategies to detect and control such diseases.

"In this article, we review the anatomical inputs and outputs to the mouse primary visual cortex, area V1. Our survey of data from the Allen Institute Mouse Connectivity project indicates that mouse V1 is highly interconnected with both cortical and subcortical brain areas. This pattern of innervation allows for computations that depend on the state of the animal and on behavioral goals, which contrasts with simple feedforward, hierarchical models of visual processing. Thus, to have an accurate description of the function of V1 during mouse behavior, its involvement with the rest of the brain circuitry has to be considered. Finally, it remains an open question whether the primary visual cortex of higher mammals displays the same degree of sensorimotor integration in the early visual system.

"OBJECTIVES: In Madagascar, plague (Yersinia pestis infection) is endemic in the central highlands, maintained by the couple Rattus rattus/flea. The rat is assumed to die shortly after infection inducing migration of the fleas. However we previously reported that black rats from endemic areas can survive the infection whereas those from non-endemic areas remained susceptible. We investigate the hypothesis that lineages of rats can acquire resistance to plague and that previous contacts with the bacteria will affect their survival, allowing maintenance of infected fleas. For this purpose, laboratory-born rats were obtained from wild black rats originating either from plague-endemic or plague-free zones, and were challenged with Y. pestis. Survival rate and antibody immune responses were analyzed. RESULTS: Inoculation of low doses of Y. pestis greatly increase survival of rats to subsequent challenge with a lethal dose. During challenge, cytokine profiles support activation of specific immune response associated with the bacteria control. In addition, F1 rats from endemic areas exhibited higher survival rates than those from non-endemic ones, suggesting a selection of a resistant lineage. In Madagascar, these results support the role of black rat as long term reservoir of infected fleas supporting maintenance of plague transmission.

"In this era of unprecedented biodiversity loss and increased zoonotic disease emergence, it is imperative to understand the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic pathogen dynamics in wildlife. Whether increasing biodiversity should lead to a decrease or increase in infection prevalence, termed the dilution and amplification effects, respectively, has been hotly debated in disease ecology. Sin Nombre hantavirus, which has an ∼35% mortality rate when it spills over into humans, occurs at a lower prevalence in the reservoir host, the North American deermouse, in areas with higher small mammal diversity-a dilution effect. However, the mechanism driving this relationship is not understood. Using a mechanistic mathematical model of infection dynamics and a unique long-term, high-resolution, multisite dataset, it appears that the observed dilution effect is a result of increasing small-mammal diversity leading to decreased deermouse population density and, subsequently, prevalence (a result of density-dependent transmission). However, once density is taken into account, there is an increase in the transmission rate at sites with higher diversity-a component amplification effect. Therefore, dilution and amplification are occurring at the same time in the same host-pathogen system; there is a component amplification effect (increase in transmission rate), but overall a net dilution because the effect of diversity on reservoir host population density is stronger. These results suggest we should focus on how biodiversity affects individual mechanisms that drive prevalence and their relative strengths if we want to make generalizable predictions across host-pathogen systems.

"Drug resistance, especially antibiotic resistance, is a growing threat to human health. To overcome this problem, it is significant to know precisely the mechanisms of drug resistance and/or self-resistance in various kingdoms, from bacteria through plants to animals, once more. This review compares the molecular mechanisms of the resistance against phycotoxins, toxins from marine and terrestrial animals, plants and fungi, and antibiotics. The results reveal that each kingdom possesses the characteristic features. The main mechanisms in each kingdom are transporters/efflux pumps in phycotoxins, mutation and modification of targets and sequestration in marine and terrestrial animal toxins, ABC transporters and sequestration in plant toxins, transporters in fungal toxins, and various or mixed mechanisms in antibiotics. Antibiotic producers in particular make tremendous efforts for avoiding suicide, and are more flexible and adaptable to the changes of environments. With these features in mind, potential alternative strategies to overcome these resistance problems are discussed. This paper will provide clues for solving the issues of drug resistance.

"In the primary visual cortex (V1) of many mammalian species, neurons are spatially organized according to their preferred orientation into a highly ordered map. However, whether and how the various presynaptic inputs to V1 neurons are organized relative to the neuronal orientation map remain unclear. To address this issue, we constructed genetically encoded calcium indicators targeting axon boutons in two colors and used them to map the organization of axon boutons of V1 intrinsic and V2-V1 feedback projections in tree shrews. Both connections are spatially organized into maps according to the preferred orientations of axon boutons. Dual-color calcium imaging showed that V1 intrinsic inputs are precisely aligned to the orientation map of V1 cell bodies, while the V2-V1 feedback projections are aligned to the V1 map with less accuracy. Nonselective integration of intrinsic presynaptic inputs around the dendritic tree is sufficient to reproduce cell body orientation preference. These results indicate that a precisely aligned map of intrinsic inputs could reinforce the neuronal map in V1, a principle that may be prevalent for brain areas with function maps.

"Demodex mites are microscopic, cigar-shaped, follicular mites often regarded as commensal microfauna in mammals. Although Demodex spp. can cause dermatologic disease in any immunocompromised mammal, they are rarely reported in laboratory mice. Recent identification of Demodex musculi in a colony of immunodeficient mice with dermatitis afforded us the opportunity to investigate the comparative sensitivity of 4 antemortem diagnostic techniques to detect D. musculi-superficial skin scrape (SSS), tape impression (TI), fur pluck (FP), and deep skin scrape (DSS)-which we performed on 4 anatomic sites (face, interscapular region [IS], caudal ventrum [CV], and caudal dorsum [CD]) in 46 mice. DSS had an overall detection rate of 91.1% (n = 112 tests), with the highest detection rates in IS (93.5%), CV (89.1%), and CD (90.0%). The detection rates for SSS (62.5%; n = 112 tests), TI (57.5%; n = 138 tests), and FP (62.7%; n = 158 tests) were all lower than for DSS. IS was the most reliable site. Results from combined FP and DSS samples collected from IS and CV yielded 100% detection, whereas the face was not a desirable sampling site due to inadequate sample quality and low detection rate. Demodex eggs and larvae were observed from FP more often than DSS (19.0% of 158 tests compared with 14.3% of 112 tests). In a subset of samples, an 18S rRNA PCR assay was equivalent to DSS for detection of mites (both 100%, n = 8). We recommend collecting samples from both IS and CV by both FP and DSS to assess for the presence of D. musculi and performing further studies to assess whether PCR analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for the detection of Demodex mites in laboratory mice.

"Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) mediate the pupillary light reflex, circadian entrainment, and may contribute to luminance and color perception. The diversity of ipRGCs varies from rodents to primates, suggesting differences in their contributions to retinal output. To further understand the variability in their organization and diversity across species, we used immunohistochemical methods to examine ipRGCs in tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri). Tree shrews share membership in the same clade, or evolutionary branch, as rodents and primates. They are highly visual, diurnal animals with a cone-dominated retina and a geniculo-cortical organization resembling that of primates. We identified cells with morphological similarities to M1 and M2 cells described previously in rodents and primates. M1-like cells typically had somas in the ganglion cell layer, with 23% displaced to the inner nuclear layer (INL). However, unlike M1 cells, they had bistratified dendritic fields ramifying in S1 and S5 that collectively tiled space. M2-like cells had dendritic fields restricted to S5 that were smaller and more densely branching. A novel third type of melanopsin immunopositive cell was identified. These cells had somata exclusively in the INL and monostratified dendritic fields restricted to S1 that tiled space. Surprisingly, these cells immunolabeled for tyrosine hydroxylase, a key component in dopamine synthesis. These cells immunolabeled for an RGC marker, not amacrine cell markers, suggesting that they are dopaminergic ipRGCs. We found no evidence for M4 or M5 ipRGCs, described previously in rodents. These results identify some organizational features of the ipRGC system that are canonical versus species-specific.

"The gut bacterial communities of mammals have profound effects on host fitness, but the processes that generate and maintain gut bacterial diversity remain poorly understood. We mapped compositional variation (i.e., β-diversity) in the gut microbiotas of 136 pairs of wild mammalian species living throughout the Americas to assess how the distribution of mammals across geographic space influences the diversification of their gut bacteria. Comparing the gut microbiotas of sympatric and allopatric mammalian populations provided insights into the flow of gut bacteria within and between mammalian communities, revealing that spatial limits on bacterial dispersal promote β-diversity between the gut microbiotas of mammalian species. Each geographic locale displayed a unique gut-microbiota composition that could not be fully explained by the diets and phylogenetic histories of the resident mammalian hosts, indicating that some gut bacteria are geographically restricted. Across the western hemisphere, the compositional overlap between the gut microbiotas of allopatric mammalian populations decayed exponentially with the geographic distance separating the hosts. The relationship between geographic distances among hosts and compositional differences among their gut microbiotas was independent of dietary and phylogenetic divergence among hosts. Within mammalian communities, we observed widespread sharing of gut bacteria between predator-prey host-species pairs, indicating horizontal transfer of gut bacteria through mammalian food chains. Collectively, these results indicate that compositional differences between the gut microbiotas of mammalian taxa are generated and maintained by limits to bacterial dispersal imposed by physical distance between hosts.

"A colony of B6.Cg-Rag1tm1Mom Tyrp1B-w Tg(Tcra,Tcrb)9Rest (TRP1/TCR) mice presented with ocular lesions and ulcerative dermatitis. Histopathology, skin scrapes, and fur plucks confirmed the presence of Demodex spp. in all clinically affected and subclinical TRP1/TCR mice examined (n = 48). Pasteurella pneumotropica and Corynebacterium bovis, both opportunistic pathogens, were cultured from the ocular lesions and skin, respectively, and bacteria were observed microscopically in abscesses at various anatomic locations (including retroorbital sites, tympanic bullae, lymph nodes, and reproductive organs) as well as the affected epidermis. The mites were identified as Demodex musculi using the skin fragment digestion technique. Topographic analysis of the skin revealed mites in almost all areas of densely haired skin, indicating a generalized demodecosis. The percentage of infested follicles in 8- to 10-wk-old mice ranged from 0% to 21%, and the number of mites per millimeter of skin ranged from 0 to 3.7. The head, interscapular region, and middorsum had the highest proportions of infested follicles, ranging from 2.3% to 21.1% (median, 4.9%), 2.0% to 16.6% (8.1%), and 0% to 17% (7.6%), respectively. The pinnae and tail skin had few or no mites, with the proportion of follicles infested ranging from 0% to 3.3% (0%) and 0% to 1.4% (0%), respectively. The number of mites per millimeter was strongly correlated with the percentage of infested follicles. After administration of amoxicillin-impregnated feed (0.12%), suppurative infections were eliminated, and the incidence of ulcerative dermatitis was dramatically reduced. We hypothesize that the Rag1-null component of the genotype makes TRP1/TCR mice susceptible to various opportunistic infestations and infections, including Demodex mites, P. pneumotropica, and C. bovis. Therefore, Rag1-null mice may serve as a useful model to study human and canine demodecosis. D. musculi should be ruled out as a contributing factor in immunocompromised mouse strains with dermatologic manifestations.

"Sylvatic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, frequently afflicts prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), causing population declines and local extirpations. We tested the effectiveness of bait-delivered sylvatic plague vaccine (SPV) in prairie dog colonies on 29 paired placebo and treatment plots (1-59 ha in size; average 16.9 ha) in 7 western states from 2013 to 2015. We compared relative abundance (using catch per unit effort (CPUE) as an index) and apparent survival of prairie dogs on 26 of the 29 paired plots, 12 with confirmed or suspected plague (Y. pestis positive carcasses or fleas). Even though plague mortality occurred in prairie dogs on vaccine plots, SPV treatment had an overall positive effect on CPUE in all three years, regardless of plague status. Odds of capturing a unique animal were 1.10 (95% confidence interval [C.I.] 1.02-1.19) times higher per trap day on vaccine-treated plots than placebo plots in 2013, 1.47 (95% C.I. 1.41-1.52) times higher in 2014 and 1.19 (95% C.I. 1.13-1.25) times higher in 2015. On pairs where plague occurred, odds of apparent survival were 1.76 (95% Bayesian credible interval [B.C.I.] 1.28-2.43) times higher on vaccine plots than placebo plots for adults and 2.41 (95% B.C.I. 1.72-3.38) times higher for juveniles. Our results provide evidence that consumption of vaccine-laden baits can protect prairie dogs against plague; however, further evaluation and refinement are needed to optimize SPV use as a management tool.

"Demodex musculi, a prostigmatid mite that has been reported infrequently in laboratory mice, has been identified with increasing frequency in contemporary colonies of immunodeficient mice. Here we describe 2 episodes of D. musculi infestation with associated clinical signs in various genetically engineered mouse strains, as well as treatment strategies and an investigation into transmissibility and host susceptibility. The first case involved D. musculi associated with clinical signs and pathologic lesions in BALB/c-Tg(DO11.10)Il13(tm) mice, which have a defect in type 2 helper T cell (Th2) immunity. Subsequent investigation revealed mite transmission to both parental strains (BALB/c-Tg[DO11.10] and BALB/c-Il13(tm)), BALB/c-Il13/Il4(tm), and wild-type BALB/c. All Tg(DO11.10)Il13(tm) mice remained infested throughout the investigation, and D. musculi were recovered from all strains when they were cohoused with BALB/c-Tg(DO11.10)Il13(tm) index mice. However, only Il13(tm) and Il13/Il4(tm) mice demonstrated persistent infestation after index mice were removed. Only BALB/c-Tg(DO11.10)Il13(tm) showed clinical signs, suggesting that the phenotypic dysfunction of Th2 immunity is sufficient for persistent infestation, whereas clinical disease associated with D. musculi appears to be genotype-specific. This pattern was further exemplified in the second case, which involved NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2r(tm1Wjl)/SzJ (NSG) and C;129S4 Rag2(tm1.1Flv) Il2rg(tm1.1Flv)/J mice with varying degrees of blepharitis, conjunctivitis, and facial pruritis. Topical amitraz decreased mite burden but did not eliminate infestation or markedly ameliorate clinical signs. Furthermore, mite burden began to increase by 1 mo posttreatment, suggesting that topical amitraz is an ineffective treatment for D. musculi. These experiences illustrate the need for vigilance regarding opportunistic and uncommon pathogens in rodent colonies, especially among mice with immunologic deficits.

"Infectious diseases that are transmitted from wildlife hosts to humans, such as the Ebola virus and MERS virus, can be difficult to understand because the pathogens emerge from complex multifaceted ecological interactions. We use a wildlife-pathogen system-prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) and the plague bacterium (Yersinia pestis)-to describe aspects of disease ecology that apply to many cases of emerging infectious disease. We show that the monitoring and surveillance of hosts and vectors during the buildup to disease outbreaks are crucial for understanding pathogen-transmission dynamics and that a community-ecology framework is important to identify reservoir hosts. Incorporating multidisciplinary approaches and frameworks may improve wildlife-pathogen surveillance and our understanding of seemingly sporadic and rare pathogen outbreaks.

"Capstone courses for upper-division students are a common feature of the undergraduate neuroscience curriculum. Here is described a method for adapting Nikolaas Tinbergen's four questions to use as a framework for a neuroscience capstone course, in this case with a particular emphasis on neurotoxins. This course is intended to be a challenging opportunity for students to integrate and apply knowledge and skills gained from their major study, a B.S. in Biological Sciences with a Concentration in Integrative Physiology and Neurobiology. In particular, a broad, integrative approach is favored, with emphasis placed on primary literature, scientific process and effective, professional communication. To achieve this, Tinbergen's four questions were adapted and implemented as the overarching framework of the course. Tinbergen's questions range from the proximate to ultimate/evolutionary view, providing an excellent base upon which to teach students an integrative approach to understanding neuroscientific phenomena. For example, a particular neurotoxin can be examined from the proximate level (i.e., mechanism: how does this toxin specifically impact neural physiology) to the ultimate/evolutionary level (i.e., adaptation: why and to what extent did this toxin evolve naturally or the reason that it was initially invented by humans). The mechanics, goals, and objectives of the course are presented as we believe that it will serve as a flexible and useful model for neuroscience capstone courses concerning a wide variety of topics across multiple types of institutions.

"Bartonellae are facultative intracellular bacteria and are highly adapted to their mammalian host cell niches. Straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) are commonly infected with several bartonella strains. To elucidate the genetic diversity of these bartonella strains, we analyzed 79 bartonella isolates from straw-colored fruit bats in seven countries across Africa (Cameroon, Annobon island of Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania, and Uganda) using a multi-locus sequencing typing (MLST) approach based on nucleotide sequences of eight loci (ftsZ, gltA, nuoG, ribC, rpoB, ssrA, ITS, and 16S rRNA). The analysis of each locus but ribC demonstrated clustering of the isolates into six genogroups (E1 - E5 and Ew), while ribC was absent in the isolates belonging to the genogroup Ew. In general, grouping of all isolates by each locus was mutually supportive; however, nuoG, gltA, and rpoB showed some incongruity with other loci in several strains, suggesting a possibility of recombination events, which were confirmed by network analyses and recombination/mutation rate ratio (r/m) estimations. The MLST scheme revealed 45 unique sequence types (ST1 - 45) among the analyzed bartonella isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences supported the discrimination of six phylogenetic lineages (E1 - E5 and Ew) corresponding to separate and unique Bartonella species. One of the defined lineages, Ew, consisted of only two STs (ST1 and ST2), and comprised more than one-quarter of the analyzed isolates, while other lineages contained higher numbers of STs with a smaller number of isolates belonging to each lineage. The low number of allelic polymorphisms of isolates belonging to Ew suggests a more recent origin for this species. Our findings suggest that at least six Bartonella species are associated with straw-colored fruit bats, and that distinct STs can be found across the distribution of this bat species, including in populations of bats which are genetically distinct.

"Median lethal dose (LD50) testing in mice is the 'gold standard' for evaluating the lethality of snake venoms and the effectiveness of interventions. As part of a study to determine the murine LD50 of the venom of 3 species of rattlesnake, temperature data were collected in an attempt to more precisely define humane endpoints. We used an 'up-and-down' methodology of estimating the LD50 that involved serial intraperitoneal injection of predetermined concentrations of venom. By using a rectal thermistor probe, body temperature was taken once before administration and at various times after venom exposure. All but one mouse showed a marked, immediate, dose-dependent drop in temperature of approximately 2 to 6°C at 15 to 45 min after administration. The lowest temperature sustained by any surviving mouse was 33.2°C. Surviving mice generally returned to near-baseline temperatures within 2 h after venom administration, whereas mice that did not survive continued to show a gradual decline in temperature until death or euthanasia. Logistic regression modeling controlling for the effects of baseline core body temperature and venom type showed that core body temperature was a significant predictor of survival. Linear regression of the interaction of time and survival was used to estimate temperatures predictive of death at the earliest time point and demonstrated that venom type had a significant influence on temperature values. Overall, our data suggest that core body temperature is a useful adjunct to monitoring for endpoints in LD50 studies and may be a valuable predictor of survival in venom studies.

"BACKGROUND: Emerging bacterial zoonoses in bats and rodents remain relatively understudied. We conduct the first comparative host-pathogen coevolutionary analyses of bacterial pathogens in these hosts, using Bartonella spp. and Leptospira spp. as a model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used published genetic data for 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. We generated maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies for hosts and bacteria, and tested for coevoutionary congruence using programs ParaFit, PACO, and Jane. Bartonella spp. and their bat hosts had a significant coevolutionary fit (ParaFitGlobal = 1.9703, P≤0.001; m2 global value = 7.3320, P≤0.0001). Bartonella spp. and rodent hosts also indicated strong overall patterns of cospeciation (ParaFitGlobal = 102.4409, P≤0.001; m2 global value = 86.532, P≤0.0001). In contrast, we were unable to reject independence of speciation events in Leptospira and bats (ParaFitGlobal = 0.0042, P = 0.84; m2 global value = 4.6310, P = 0.5629). Separate analyses of New World and Old World data subsets yielded results congruent with analysis from entire datasets. We also conducted event-based cophylogeny analyses to reconstruct likely evolutionary histories for each group of pathogens and hosts. Leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches per parasite (0.731), while Bartonella and rodents had the fewest (0.264). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In both bat and rodent hosts, Bartonella exhibits significant coevolution with minimal host switching, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has high number of host switches. Reasons underlying these variable coevolutionary patterns in host range are likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology. Understanding the coevolutionary patterns and frequency of host-switching events between bacterial pathogens and their hosts will allow better prediction of spillover between mammal reservoirs, and ultimately to humans.

"Emerging pathogens that originate from invasive species have caused numerous significant epidemics. Some bacteria of genus Bartonella are rodent-borne pathogens that can cause disease in humans and animals alike. We analyzed gltA sequences of 191 strains of rat-associated bartonellae from 29 rodent species from 17 countries to test the hypotheses that this bacterial complex evolved and diversified in Southeast Asia before being disseminated by commensal rats Rattus rattus (black rat) and Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) to other parts of the globe. The analysis suggests that there have been numerous dispersal events within Asia and introductions from Asia to other regions, with six major clades containing Southeast Asian isolates that appear to have been dispersed globally. Phylogeographic analyses support the hypotheses that these bacteria originated in Southeast Asia and commensal rodents (R. rattus and R. norvegicus) play key roles in the evolution and dissemination of this Bartonella complex throughout the world.

"BACKGROUND: The persistence of bovine TB (bTB) in various countries throughout the world is enhanced by the existence of wildlife hosts for the infection. In Britain and Ireland, the principal wildlife host for bTB is the badger (Meles meles). The objective of our study was to examine the dynamics of bTB in badgers in relation to both badger-derived infection from within the population and externally-derived, trickle-type, infection, such as could occur from other species or environmental sources, using a spatial stochastic simulation model. RESULTS: The presence of external sources of infection can increase mean prevalence and reduce the threshold group size for disease persistence. Above the threshold equilibrium group size of 6-8 individuals predicted by the model for bTB persistence in badgers based on internal infection alone, external sources of infection have relatively little impact on the persistence or level of disease. However, within a critical range of group sizes just below this threshold level, external infection becomes much more important in determining disease dynamics. Within this critical range, external infection increases the ratio of intra- to inter-group infections due to the greater probability of external infections entering fully-susceptible groups. The effect is to enable bTB persistence and increase bTB prevalence in badger populations which would not be able to maintain bTB based on internal infection alone. CONCLUSIONS: External sources of bTB infection can contribute to the persistence of bTB in badger populations. In high-density badger populations, internal badger-derived infections occur at a sufficient rate that the additional effect of external sources in exacerbating disease is minimal. However, in lower-density populations, external sources of infection are much more important in enhancing bTB prevalence and persistence. In such circumstances, it is particularly important that control strategies to reduce bTB in badgers include efforts to minimise such external sources of infection.

"Plague (Yersinia pestis infection) is a highly virulent rodent disease that persists in many natural ecosystems. The black rat (Rattus rattus) is the main host involved in the plague focus of the central highlands of Madagascar. Black rat populations from this area are highly resistant to plague, whereas those from areas in which the disease is absent (low altitude zones of Madagascar) are susceptible. Various lines of evidence suggest a role for the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) in plague resistance. We therefore used the MHC region as a candidate for detecting signatures of plague-mediated selection in Malagasy black rats, by comparing population genetic structures for five MHC-linked microsatellites and neutral markers in two sampling designs. We first compared four pairs of populations, each pair including one population from the plague focus and one from the disease-free zone. Plague-mediated selection was expected to result in greater genetic differentiation between the two zones than expected under neutrality and this was observed for one MHC-class I-linked locus (D20Img2). For this marker as well as for four other MHC-linked loci, a geographic pattern of genetic structure was found at local scale within the plague focus. This pattern would be expected if plague selection pressures were spatially variable. Finally, another MHC-class I-linked locus (D20Rat21) showed evidences of balancing selection, but it seems more likely that this selection would be related to unknown pathogens more widely distributed in Madagascar than plague.

"In some rodent species frequently exposed to plague outbreaks caused by Yersinia pestis, resistance to the disease has evolved as a population trait. As a first step in determining if plague resistance has developed in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), animals captured from colonies in a plague-free region (South Dakota) and two plague-endemic regions (Colorado and Texas) were challenged with Y. pestis at one of three doses (2.5, 250, or 2500 mouse LD50s). South Dakota prairie dogs were far more susceptible to plague than Colorado and Texas prairie dogs (p<0.001), with a mortality rate of nearly 100% over all doses. Colorado and Texas prairie dogs were quite similar in their response, with overall survival rates of 50% and 60%, respectively. Prairie dogs from these states were heterogeneous in their response, with some animals dying at the lowest dose (37% and 20%, respectively) and some surviving even at the highest dose (29% and 40%, respectively). Microsatellite analysis revealed that all three groups were distinct genetically, but further studies are needed to establish a genetic basis for the observed differences in plague resistance.

"Serotonin (5-HT) has long been considered as a key transmitter in the neurocircuitry controlling aggression. Impaired regulation of each subtype of 5-HT receptor, 5-HT transporter, synthetic and metabolic enzymes has been linked particularly to impulsive aggression. The current summary focuses mostly on recent findings from pharmacological and genetic studies. The pharmacological treatments and genetic manipulations or polymorphisms of aspecific target (e.g., 5-HT1A receptor) can often result in inconsistent results on aggression, due to ""phasic"" effects of pharmacological agents versus ""trait""-like effects of genetic manipulations. Also, the local administration of a drug using the intracranial microinjection technique has shown that activation of specific subtypes of 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A and 5-HT1B) in mesocorticolimbic areas can reduce species-typical and other aggressive behaviors, but the same receptors in the medial prefrontal cortex or septal area promote escalated forms of aggression. Thus, there are receptor populations in specific brain regions that preferentially modulate specific types of aggression. Genetic studies have shown important gene-environment interactions; it is likely that the polymorphisms in the genes of 5-HT transporters or rate-limiting synthetic and metabolic enzymes of 5-HT (e.g., MAOA) determine the vulnerability to adverse environmental factors that escalate aggression. We also discuss the interaction between the 5-HT system and other systems. Modulation of 5-HT neurons in the dorsalraphe nucleus by GABA, glutamate and CRF profoundly regulate aggressive behaviors. Also, interactions of the 5-HT system with other neuropeptides(arginine vasopressin, oxytocin, neuropeptide Y, opioid) have emerged as important neurobiological determinants of aggression. Studies of aggression in genetically modified mice identified several molecules that affect the 5-HT system directly (e.g., Tph2, 5-HT1B, 5-HT transporter, Pet1, MAOA) or indirectly[e.g., BDNF, neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS), aCaMKII, Neuropeptide Y].The future agenda delineates specific receptor subpopulations for GABA, glutamate and neuropeptides as they modulate the canonical aminergic neurotransmitters in brainstem, limbic and cortical regions with the ultimate outcome of attenuating or escalating aggressive behavior.

"Host populations for the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, are highly variable in their response to plague ranging from near deterministic extinction (i.e., epizootic dynamics) to a low probability of extinction despite persistent infection (i.e., enzootic dynamics). Much of the work to understand this variability has focused on specific host characteristics, such as population size and resistance, and their role in determining plague dynamics. Here, however, we advance the idea that the relative importance of alternative transmission routes may vary causing shifts from epizootic to enzootic dynamics. We present a model that incorporates host and flea ecology with multiple transmission hypotheses to study how transmission shifts determine population responses to plague. Our results suggest enzootic persistence relies on infection of an off-host flea reservoir and epizootics rely on transiently maintained flea infection loads through repeated infectious feeds by fleas. In either case, early-phase transmission by fleas (i.e., transmission immediately following an infected blood meal) has been observed in laboratory studies, and we show that it is capable of driving plague dynamics at the population level. Sensitivity analysis of model parameters revealed that host characteristics (e.g., population size and resistance) vary in importance depending on transmission dynamics, suggesting that host ecology may scale differently through different transmission routes enabling prediction of population responses in a more robust way than using either host characteristics or transmission shifts alone.

"Adaptive radiation is the rapid origination of multiple species from a single ancestor as the result of concurrent adaptation to disparate environments. This fundamental evolutionary process is considered to be responsible for the genesis of a great portion of the diversity of life. Bacteria have evolved enormous biological diversity by exploiting an exceptional range of environments, yet diversification of bacteria via adaptive radiation has been documented in a few cases only and the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we show a compelling example of adaptive radiation in pathogenic bacteria and reveal their genetic basis. Our evolutionary genomic analyses of the α-proteobacterial genus Bartonella uncover two parallel adaptive radiations within these host-restricted mammalian pathogens. We identify a horizontally-acquired protein secretion system, which has evolved to target specific bacterial effector proteins into host cells as the evolutionary key innovation triggering these parallel adaptive radiations. We show that the functional versatility and adaptive potential of the VirB type IV secretion system (T4SS), and thereby translocated Bartonella effector proteins (Beps), evolved in parallel in the two lineages prior to their radiations. Independent chromosomal fixation of the virB operon and consecutive rounds of lineage-specific bep gene duplications followed by their functional diversification characterize these parallel evolutionary trajectories. Whereas most Beps maintained their ancestral domain constitution, strikingly, a novel type of effector protein emerged convergently in both lineages. This resulted in similar arrays of host cell-targeted effector proteins in the two lineages of Bartonella as the basis of their independent radiation. The parallel molecular evolution of the VirB/Bep system displays a striking example of a key innovation involved in independent adaptive processes and the emergence of bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, our study highlights the remarkable evolvability of T4SSs and their effector proteins, explaining their broad application in bacterial interactions with the environment.

"Bartonella infections are common in rodents. From 1994 to 2006, longitudinal studies of a rodent community, consisting mainly of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), were conducted in southwestern Colorado to study hantaviruses. Blood samples from deer mice captured one or more times during the period 2003 to 2006 (n = 737) were selected to study bartonellae in deer mice. Bartonellae were found to be widely distributed in that population, with an overall prevalence of 82.4% (607/737 mice). No correlation was found between bartonella prevalence and deer mouse weight or sex. Persistent or successive infections with bartonellae were observed in deer mice captured repeatedly, with a prevalence of 83.9% (297/354), and the infection appeared to last for more than 1 year in some of them. Persistent infection with bartonellae may explain the high prevalence of these bacteria in deer mice at this site and, perhaps, elsewhere. Genetic analysis demonstrated that deer mouse-borne bartonella isolates at this site belong to the same species, B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis, demonstrating a specific relationship between B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis and deer mice.

"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by the occurrence of exacerbations triggered by infections. The aim of this study was to determine the composition of the lung microbiome and lung virome in patients with COPD in an African setting and to compare their composition between the stable and exacerbated states. Twenty-four adult COPD patients were recruited from three hospitals. Sputum was collected and bacterial DNA was extracted. Targeted metagenomics was performed to determine the microbiome composition. Viral DNA and RNA were extracted from selected samples followed by cDNA conversion. Shotgun metagenomics sequencing was performed on pooled DNA and RNA. The most abundant phyla across all samples were Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. The following genera were most prevalent: Haemophilus and Streptococcus. There were no considerable differences for alpha and beta diversity measures between the disease states. However, a difference in the abundances between disease states was observed for: (i) Serratia (3% lower abundance in exacerbated state), (ii) Granulicatella (2.2% higher abundance in exacerbated state), (iii) Haemophilus (5.7% higher abundance in exacerbated state) and (iv) Veillonella (2.5% higher abundance in exacerbated state). Virome analysis showed a high abundance of the BeAn 58058 virus, a member of the Poxviridae family, in all six samples (90% to 94%). This study is among the first to report lung microbiome composition in COPD patients from Africa. In this small sample set, no differences in alpha or beta diversity between stable and exacerbated disease state was observed, but an unexpectedly high frequency of BeAn 58058 virus was observed. These observations highlight the need for further research of the lung microbiome of COPD patients in African settings.

"INTRODUCTION: Ixodes tropicalis is a little-known tick species reported parasitizing wild rodents only in Colombia and Perú. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of I. tropicalis infesting a human in the south of the metropolitan area of the Valle de Aburrá, Antioquia, Colombia, and to report the molecular detection of Rickettsia bellii in this species. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tick was identified using a morphological key and sequencing of tick mitochondrial 16S rRNA. Additionally, bacterial and protozoa pathogens were evaluated using PCR for the detection of Rickettsia spp., family Anaplasmataceae, Borrelia spp., and piroplasmid. RESULTS: We identified the tick as an I. tropicalis female according to Kohls, 1956, description and to partial 16S rRNA sequences showing a minimum of 5% divergencies compared to Ixodes sequences. We also detected the gltA gene of R. bellii in the tick with 99.87% of identity. CONCLUSION: This is the first report in Colombia of a species of the Ixodes genus parasitizing a human and the first report of the detection of R. bellii in this tick species.

"Influenza A virus is one of the most important zoonotic pathogens that can cause severe symptoms and has the potential to cause high number of deaths and great economic loss. Vaccination is still the best option to prevent influenza virus infection. Different types of influenza vaccines, including live attenuated virus vaccines, inactivated whole virus vaccines, virosome vaccines, split-virion vaccines and subunit vaccines have been developed. However, they have several limitations, such as the relatively high manufacturing cost and long production time, moderate efficacy of some of the vaccines in certain populations, and lack of cross-reactivity. These are some of the problems that need to be solved. Here, we summarized recent advances in the development and application of different types of influenza vaccines, including the recent development of viral vectored influenza vaccines. We also described the construction of other vaccines that are based on recombinant influenza viruses as viral vectors. Information provided in this review article might lead to the development of safe and highly effective novel influenza vaccines.

"From 2016 to 2018, Brazil faced the biggest yellow fever (YF) outbreak in the last 80 years, representing a risk of YF reurbanization, especially in megacities. Along with this challenge, the mass administration of the fractionated YF vaccine dose in a naïve population brought another concern: the possibility to increase YF adverse events associated with viscerotropic (YEL-AVD) or neurological disease (YEL-AND). For this reason, we developed a quantitative real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay based on a duplex TaqMan protocol to distinguish broad-spectrum infections caused by wild-type yellow fever virus (YFV) strain from adverse events following immunization (AEFI) by 17DD strain during the vaccination campaign used to contain this outbreak. A rapid and more accurate RT-qPCR assay to diagnose YFV was established, being able to detect even different YFV genotypes and geographic strains that circulate in Central and South America. Moreover, after testing around 1400 samples from human cases, non-human primates and mosquitoes, we detected just two YEL-AVD cases, confirmed by sequencing, during the massive vaccination in Brazilian Southeast region, showing lower incidence than AEFI as expected.

"The composition of tick microbiomes varies both within and among tick species. Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics) or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of neotropical ticks collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Francisella and Rickettsia were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species, and we found both positive and negative cooccurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g., Coxiella and Rickettsiella) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected Anaplasma and Bartonella in several tick species. Our results indicate that the microbial composition and richness of neotropical ticks are principally related to intrinsic factors (tick species and life stage) and collection site. Taken together, our analysis informs how tick microbiomes are structured and can help anchor our understanding of tick microbiomes from tropical environments more broadly.IMPORTANCE Blood-feeding arthropod microbiomes often play important roles in disease transmission, yet the factors that structure tick microbial communities in the Neotropics are unknown. Utilizing ticks collected from live animals in neotropical forest fragments, this study teases apart the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic tick-associated factors on tick microbial composition as well as which specific microbes contribute to differences across tick species, tick life stages, the mammals they fed on, and the locations from where they were sampled. Furthermore, this study provides revelations of how notable tick-associated bacterial genera are interacting with other tick-associated microbes as well as the forest animals they encounter.

"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a rare but serious adverse drug effect. There are multiple hypotheses to explain the development of MRONJ. Reduced bone remodeling and infection or inflammation are considered central to the pathogenesis of MRONJ. In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that bisphosphonates (BPs)-mediated immunity dysfunction is associated with the pathophysiology of MRONJ. In a healthy state, mucosal immunity provides the first line of protection against pathogens and oral mucosal immune cells defense against potentially invading pathogens by mediating the generation of protective immunoinflammatory responses. In addition, the immune system takes part in the process of bone remodeling and tissue repair. However, the treatment of BPs disturbs the mucosal and osteo immune homeostasis and thus impairs the body's ability to resist infection and repair from injury, thereby adding to the development of MRONJ. Here, we present the current knowledge about immunity dysfunction to shed light on the role of local immune disorder in the development of MRONJ.

"Substance P (SP) is a tachykinin that regulates airway mucous secretion in both health and disease. Our study aimed to determine whether overexpression of SP without pre-existing inflammation was sufficient to induce changes in mucin secretion and transport in small airways. Utilizing porcine precision-cut lung slices, we measured the impact of AAV-mediated overexpression of SP on airway physiology ex vivo. Immunofluorescence signal intensity for MUC5AC was significantly increased in SP-overexpressed precision-cut lung slices compared to GFP controls. No difference in MUC5B signal intensity between treatments was detected. SP-overexpressed precision-cut lung slices also exhibited decreased IL10 mRNA, an important inhibitor of mucous cell metaplasia. Overt deficits in mucociliary transport were not noted, though a trend for decreased mean transport speed was detected in methacholine-challenged airways overexpressing SP compared to GFP controls. Pharmacologic inhibition of the NF-kβ pathway abrogated the effects of overexpression of SP on both MUC5AC and IL10. Collectively, these data suggest that overexpression of SP in the absence of existing inflammation increases MUC5AC via activation of the NF-kβ pathway. Thus, these data further highlight SP as a key driver of abnormal mucous secretion and underscore NF-kβ signaling as a pathway of potential therapeutic intervention.

"Leptospirosis is a re-emerging worldwide zoonotic disease. Even though the primary serological test for diagnosis and surveying is the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), isolation remains the gold-standard test to detect Leptospira infections. The leptospirosis transmission is linked to maintenance and accidental hosts. In the epidemiology of Leptospira some serovar are strictly related to specific maintenance hosts; however, in recent years, the bacterium was isolated from an even wider spectrum of species. The aim of this review is to report the isolation of Leptospira strains in animals which could be recognized as ""unconventional"" hosts, analyzing studies from 1960 to 2020 that highlighted the Leptospira isolation. This scientific literature aimed to provide evidence of infection in several animal species including of the Carnivora, Didelphimorphia, Rodentia, Cetacea, Cingulata, Afrosoricida, Chiroptera and Primate orders, as well as in Reptilia and Amphibia classes. In conclusion, the spreading of Leptospira is attention-worthy because the infection could occur in all the animal species ranging in a specific area. Further screening and isolations are needed to collect all necessary data to gain a complete understanding of leptospirosis epidemiology and its modifications.

"Periodontal disease (PD) is an infectious-inflammatory oral disease that is highly prevalent among adolescence and adulthood and can lead to chronic orofacial pain and be associated with anxiety, stress and depression. This study aimed to identify anxiety-like behaviors in the ligature-induced murine preclinical model of PD in different phases of the disease (i.e., acute vs. chronic). Also, we investigated orofacial mechanical allodynia thresholds and superficial cortical plasticity along the orofacial motor cortex in both disease phases. To this aim, 25 male Wistar rats were randomly allocated in acute (14 days) or chronic (28 days) ligature-induced-PD groups and further divided into active-PD or sham-PD. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using the elevated plus maze, mechanical allodynia assessed using the von Frey filaments test and superficial motor cortex mapping was performed with electrical transdural stimulation. We observed increased anxiety-like behavior in active-PD animals in the acute phase, characterized by decreased number of entries into the open arm extremities [t ((1,7)) = 2.42, p = 0.04], and reduced time spent in the open arms [t ((1,7)) = 3.56, p = 0.01] and in the open arm extremities [t ((1,7)) = 2.75, p = 0.03]. There was also a reduction in the mechanical allodynia threshold in all active-PD animals [Acute: t ((1,7)) = 8.81, p < 0.001; Chronic: t ((1,6)) = 60.0, p < 0.001], that was positively correlated with anxiety-like behaviors in the acute group. No differences were observed in motor cortex mapping. Thus, our findings show the presence of anxiety-like behaviors in the acute phase of PD making this a suitable model to study the impact of anxiety in treatment response and treatment efficacy.

"Despite their diversity, most double-stranded-RNA (dsRNA) viruses share a specialized T=1 capsid built from dimers of a single protein that provides a platform for genome transcription and replication. This ubiquitous capsid remains structurally undisturbed throughout the viral cycle, isolating the genome to avoid triggering host defense mechanisms. Human picobirnavirus (hPBV) is a dsRNA virus frequently associated with gastroenteritis, although its pathogenicity is yet undefined. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of hPBV at 2.6-Å resolution. The capsid protein (CP) is arranged in a single-shelled, ∼380-Å-diameter T=1 capsid with a rough outer surface similar to that of dsRNA mycoviruses. The hPBV capsid is built of 60 quasisymmetric CP dimers (A and B) stabilized by domain swapping, and only the CP-A N-terminal basic region interacts with the packaged nucleic acids. hPBV CP has an α-helical domain with a fold similar to that of fungal partitivirus CP, with many domain insertions in its C-terminal half. In contrast to dsRNA mycoviruses, hPBV has an extracellular life cycle phase like complex reoviruses, which indicates that its own CP probably participates in cell entry. Using an in vitro reversible assembly/disassembly system of hPBV, we isolated tetramers as possible assembly intermediates. We used atomic force microscopy to characterize the biophysical properties of hPBV capsids with different cargos (host nucleic acids or proteins) and found that the CP N-terminal segment not only is involved in nucleic acid interaction/packaging but also modulates the mechanical behavior of the capsid in conjunction with the cargo.IMPORTANCE Despite intensive study, human virus sampling is still sparse, especially for viruses that cause mild or asymptomatic disease. Human picobirnavirus (hPBV) is a double-stranded-RNA virus, broadly dispersed in the human population, but its pathogenicity is uncertain. Here, we report the hPBV structure derived from cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and reconstruction methods using three capsid protein variants (of different lengths and N-terminal amino acid compositions) that assemble as virus-like particles with distinct properties. The hPBV near-atomic structure reveals a quasisymmetric dimer as the structural subunit and tetramers as possible assembly intermediates that coassemble with nucleic acids. Our structural studies and atomic force microscopy analyses indicate that hPBV capsids are potentially excellent nanocages for gene therapy and targeted drug delivery in humans.

"This article presents a general overview of the prevalence, genetic diversity and detection methods of picobirnaviruses (PBVs), which are small, non-enveloped icosahedral viruses with a segmented double-stranded RNA genome consisting of two segments taxonomically related to the genus Picobirnavirus of the family Picobirnaviridae. This review of scientific papers published in 1988-2019 provides data on the PBV distribution in the nature and a broad host range. PBV infection is characterized as opportunistic, the lack of understanding of the etiological role of PBVs in diarrhea is emphasized, since these viruses are detected both in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. The concept of PBV infection as a chronic disease caused by a long-lasting persistence of the virus in the host is considered. Such factors as stress syndrome, physiological conditions, immune status and host age at the time of primary PBV infection influence the virus detection rate in humans and animals. The possible zoonotic nature of human PBV infection is noted due to the capacity for interspecies PBV transmission acquired during evolution as a result of the reassortment of the genome segments of different viruses infecting the same host. Data providing evidence that PBVs belong to eukaryotes and a challenging hypothesis stating that PBVs are bacterial viruses are presented. The need to intensify work on PBV detection because of their wide distribution, despite the complexity due to the lack of the cultivation system, is emphasized. Two strategies of RT-PCR as main PBV detection methods are considered. The genomes of individual representatives of the genus isolated from different hosts are characterized. Emphasis is placed on the feasibility of developing primers with broader specificity for expanding the range of identifiable representatives of the genus PBV due to a huge variety of their genotypes. The importance of effective monitoring of PBV prevalence for studying the zoonotic and anthroponotic potential using metagenomic analysis is highlighted, and so is the possibility of using PBV as a marker for environmental monitoring.

"During ecological investigations for arboviruses conducted in coastal Chiapas, Mexico, in 2007, isolate MP1078 was obtained from a pool of Psorophora varipes mosquitoes. Based on antigenic characterization, this isolate was classified as a strain of Patois virus (PATV) (Orthobunyavirus genus, Peribunyaviridae family). Recently, we conducted nearly complete genome sequencing of this isolate to gain further insight into its genetic relationship with other members of the Patois serogroup. Based on the genetic characterization, we determined that MP1078 contains S, M, and L genome segments that are genetically distinct from other viruses within the Patois serogroup. Serological analyses confirmed the taxonomic classification of MP1078 as a new virus and species within the Patois serogroup, and we propose the name Barrita virus (BITV).

"Tenacious mucus produced by tracheal and bronchial submucosal glands is a defining feature of several airway diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Airway acidification as a driving force of CF airway pathology has been controversial. Here we tested the hypothesis that transient airway acidification produces pathologic mucus and impairs mucociliary transport. We studied pigs challenged with intra-airway acid. Acid had a minimal effect on mucus properties under basal conditions. However, cholinergic stimulation in acid-challenged pigs revealed retention of mucin 5B (MUC5B) in the submucosal glands, decreased concentrations of MUC5B in the lung lavage fluid, and airway obstruction. To more closely mimic a CF-like environment, we also examined mucus secretion and transport following cholinergic stimulation under diminished bicarbonate and chloride transport conditions ex vivo. Under these conditions, airways from acid-challenged pigs displayed extensive mucus films and decreased mucociliary transport. Pretreatment with diminazene aceturate, a small molecule with ability to inhibit acid detection through blockade of the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC) at the doses provided, did not prevent acid-induced pathologic mucus or transport defects but did mitigate airway obstruction. These findings suggest that transient airway acidification early in life has significant impacts on mucus secretion and transport properties. Furthermore, they highlight diminazene aceturate as an agent that might be beneficial in alleviating airway obstruction.

"Molecular information is crucial for species identification when facing challenging morphology-based specimen identifications. The use of DNA barcodes partially solves this problem, but in some cases when PCR is not an option (i.e., primers are not available, problems in reaction standardization), amplification-free approaches could be an optimal alternative. Recent advances in DNA sequencing, like the MinION device from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), allow to obtain genomic data with low laboratory and technical requirements, and at a relatively low cost. In this study, we explore ONT sequencing for molecular species identification from a total DNA sample obtained from a neotropical rodent and we also test the technology for complete mitochondrial genome reconstruction via genome skimming. We were able to obtain ""de novo"" the complete mitogenome of a specimen from the genus Melanomys (Cricetidae: Sigmodontinae) with average depth coverage of 78X using ONT-only data and by combining multiple assembly routines. Our pipeline for an automated species identification was able to identify the sample using unassembled sequence data (raw) in a reasonable computing time, which was substantially reduced when a priori information related to the organism identity was known. Our findings suggest ONT sequencing as a suitable candidate to solve species identification problems in metazoan nonmodel organisms and generate complete mtDNA datasets.

"Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent of Lassa fever, is estimated to be responsible for up to 300,000 new infections and 5000 deaths each year across Western Africa. The most recent 2018 and 2019 Nigerian outbreaks featured alarmingly high fatality rates of up to 25.4%. In addition to the severity and high fatality of the disease, a significant population of survivors suffer from long-term sequelae, such as sensorineural hearing loss, resulting in a huge socioeconomic burden in endemic regions. There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved vaccines, and therapeutics remain extremely limited for Lassa fever. Development of countermeasures depends on relevant animal models that can develop a disease strongly mimicking the pathogenic features of Lassa fever in humans. The objective of this review is to evaluate the currently available animal models for LASV infection with an emphasis on their pathogenic and histologic characteristics as well as recent advances in the development of a suitable rodent model. This information may facilitate the development of an improved animal model for understanding disease pathogenesis of Lassa fever and for vaccine or antiviral testing.

"Viruses of human or animal origin can spread in the environment and infect people via water and food. These viruses are released into the environment by various routes including water runoffs and aerosols. Furthermore, zoonotic viruses may infect humans exposed to contaminated surface waters. Viruses are emerging pathogens and are able to adapt by mutation, recombination, and reassortment and can thus become able to infect new hosts and to adjust to new environments. Enteric viruses are among the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens, causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illness. While considerable research has documented the risk of enteric viruses to human health from contact with contaminated water, the current bacterial indicator-based methods for the evaluation of water quality are often ineffectual proxies for pathogenic viruses, but no correlation was established between the enteric bacteria and viruses studied. The present chapter will focus on viral pathogens shown to be transmitted through water. It will also provide an overview of viruses that had not been a concern for waterborne transmission in the past, but that may represent potentially emerging waterborne pathogens due to their occurrence and persistence in water environments. Monitoring effluents from wastewater treatment plants is important to preventing both environmental contamination and the spread of disease.

"Prolonged heat and sea salt aerosols pose a challenge for the mammalian airway, placing the protective airway surface liquid (ASL) at risk for desiccation. Thus, mammals inhabiting salt marshes might have acquired adaptations for ASL regulation. We studied the airways of the rice rat, a rodent that inhabits salt marshes. We discovered negligible Na(+) transport through the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). In contrast, carbachol induced a large Cl(-) secretory current that was blocked by the calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) inhibitor CaCCinhi-A01. Decreased mRNA expression of α, β, and γ ENaC, and increased mRNA expression of the CaCC transmembrane member 16A, distinguished the rice rat airway. Rice rat airway cultures also secreted fluid in response to carbachol and displayed an exaggerated expansion of the ASL volume when challenged with 3.5% NaCl. These data suggest that the rice rat airway might possess unique ion transport adaptations to facilitate survival in the salt marsh environment.

"BACKGROUND: L1 retrotransposons have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for the entire history of mammals and currently compose ~ 20% of a mammalian genome. B1 retrotransposons are dependent on L1 for retrotransposition and span the evolutionary history of rodents since their radiation. L1s were found to have lost their activity in a group of South American rodents, the Sigmodontinae, and B1 inactivation preceded the extinction of L1 in the same group. Consequently, a basal group of sigmodontines have active L1s but inactive B1s and a derived clade have both inactive L1s and B1s. It has been suggested that B1s became extinct during a long period of L1 quiescence and that L1s subsequently reemerged in the basal group. RESULTS: Here we investigate the evolutionary histories of L1 and B1 in the sigmodontine rodents and show that L1 activity continued until after the L1-extinct clade and the basal group diverged. After the split, L1 had a small burst of activity in the former group, followed by extinction. In the basal group, activity was initially low but was followed by a dramatic increase in L1 activity. We found the last wave of B1 retrotransposition was large and probably preceded the split between the two rodent clades. CONCLUSIONS: Given that L1s had been steadily retrotransposing during the time corresponding to B1 extinction and that the burst of B1 activity preceding B1 extinction was large, we conclude that B1 extinction was not a result of L1 quiescence. Rather, the burst of B1 activity may have contributed to L1 extinction both by competition with L1 and by putting strong selective pressure on the host to control retrotransposition.

"In order to provide a comprehensive resource for human structural variants (SVs), we generated long-read sequence data and analyzed SVs for fifteen human genomes. We sequence resolved 99,604 insertions, deletions, and inversions including 2,238 (1.6 Mbp) that are shared among all discovery genomes with an additional 13,053 (6.9 Mbp) present in the majority, indicating minor alleles or errors in the reference. Genotyping in 440 additional genomes confirms the most common SVs in unique euchromatin are now sequence resolved. We report a ninefold SV bias toward the last 5 Mbp of human chromosomes with nearly 55% of all VNTRs (variable number of tandem repeats) mapping to this portion of the genome. We identify SVs affecting coding and noncoding regulatory loci improving annotation and interpretation of functional variation. These data provide the framework to construct a canonical human reference and a resource for developing advanced representations capable of capturing allelic diversity.

"Rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) are an unconventional laboratory species that has been used to study photoperiodicity, periodontitis, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Interventional procedures that require anesthesia, including oral procedures, are sometimes necessary in preclinical settings. The use of anesthetics including isoflurane and ketamine combined with α2-adrenoreceptor agonists, such as dexmedetomidine and xylazine, is well-established for laboratory rodents. However, their effects have been studied only modestly in rice rats. The aims of this study were to 1) determine the safety and consistency of 3 common anesthetic modalities in rice rats; 2) compare the physiologic and clinical responses to these anesthetics, and 3) verify the effectiveness of the most successful modality by testing it during an oral procedure (tooth extraction). Isoflurane, intraperitoneal ketamine-dexmedetomidine, and intraperitoneal ketamine-xylazine were evaluated by using a crossover design, in which each rat received all of the anesthetics. Compared with ketamine-dexmedetomidine and ketamine-xylazine, isoflurane inhalation through a nose cone produced more rapid induction, entry to a surgical plane of anesthesia, and initial recovery. In addition, isoflurane produced optimal anesthesia throughout the procedure for most rats. Unlike ketamine-dexmedetomidine and ketamine-xylazine, isoflurane did not alter rectal temperature, SpO₂, or respiratory rate during the surgical tolerance period, whereas ketamine-dexmedetomidine and ketamine-xylazine decreased rectal temperature during the last stage of anesthesia and induced cardiorespiratory depression. Furthermore, 2 rats experienced negative outcomes warranting euthanasia: one after receiving ketamine-dexmedetomidine, and the other after ketamine-xylazine anesthesia. In conclusion, isoflurane was the most reliable and effective anesthetic in rice rats and maintained a surgical depth of anesthesia for as long as 30 min, thus supporting successful tooth extractions.

"The reliable identification and classification of infectious diseases is critical for understanding their biology and controlling their impact. Recent advances in sequencing technology have allowed insight into the remarkable diversity of the virosphere, of which a large component remains undiscovered. For these emerging or undescribed viruses, the process of classifying unknown sequences is heavily reliant on existing nucleotide sequence information in public databases. However, due to the enormous diversity of viruses, and past focus on the most prevalent and impactful virus types, databases are often incomplete. Picobirnaviridae is a dsRNA virus family with broad host and geographic range, but with relatively little sequence information in public databases. The family contains one genus, Picobirnavirus, which may be associated with gastric illness in humans and animals. Little further information is available due in part to difficulties in identification. Here, we investigate diversity both within the genus Picobirnavirus and among other dsRNA virus types using a combined phylogenetic and functional (protein structure homology-modelling) approach. Our results show that diversity within picobirnavirus exceeds that seen between many other dsRNA genera. Furthermore, we find that commonly used practices employed to classify picobirnavirus, such as analysis of short fragments and trimming of sequences, can influence phylogenetic conclusions. The degree of phylogenetic and functional divergence among picobirnavirus sequences in our study suggests an enormous undiscovered diversity, which contributes to the undescribed ""viral dark matter"" component of metagenomic studies.

"PURPOSE: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a rare but severe side effect of antiresorptive medications. Most animal models use tooth extraction as an instigating local factor to induce MRONJ, with varied results. However, these teeth are healthy and absent of dental disease, a rare finding that does not reflect clinical practices. The authors hypothesized that extraction of teeth with periapical inflammation would lead to MRONJ in rats treated with high-dose bisphosphonates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were pretreated with zoledronic acid (ZA) for 1 week. Pulp exposure (PE) was established by exposing the pulpal chamber of the first and second molars. Experimental periapical disease (EPD) was induced by PE and bacterial inoculation into pulp chambers of the first and second mandibular molars. The mandibular molars were extracted 4 weeks after PE or EPD, and animals were euthanized 4 weeks after tooth extraction. Extraction sockets were assessed clinically, radiographically, and histologically. RESULTS: Clinically, radiographically, and histologically, socket healing was observed in all vehicle-treated animals and in ZA-treated animals after extraction of healthy teeth or teeth with PE. In contrast, bone exposure, lack of socket healing, and osteonecrosis were present in most ZA-treated animals after extraction of teeth with EPD. Bacterial presence was noted in areas of osteonecrotic alveolar bone. CONCLUSION: These data support a synergistic contribution of severe dental disease and tooth extraction to MRONJ pathogenesis. Importantly, this model is amenable to manipulation of methodologic conditions for the dissection of parameters involved in MRONJ pathogenesis.

"Bovine vaccinia (BV), caused by Vaccinia virus (VACV), is a zoonosis characterized by exanthematous lesions in the teats of dairy cows and the hands of milkers and is an important public health issue. Severe VACV-induced lesions in the teats and udder of cows and buffaloes could lead to mastitis and other secondary infections, thereby reducing productivity and resulting in economic losses to the dairy industry. In Brazil, BV re-emerged in the late 1990s and is now endemic in most of the Brazilian territory. In the last 15 years, much effort has been made to know more about this disease and its epidemiology, etiologic agents, and interactions with the host and the environment. In this review, we describe the known dynamics of VACV infection in cattle and the viral shedding routes, as well as the relevance of BV for animal and public health.

"The Mammarenavirus genus includes several pathogenic species of rodent-borne viruses. Old World (OW) mammarenaviruses infect rodents in the Murinae subfamily and are mainly transmitted in Africa and Asia; New World (NW) mammarenaviruses are found in rodents of the Cricetidae subfamily in the Americas. We applied a selection-informed method to estimate that OW and NW mammarenaviruses diverged less than ∼45,000 years ago (ya). By incorporating phylogeographic inference, we show that NW mammarenaviruses emerged in the Latin America-Caribbean region ∼41,400-3,300 ya, whereas OW mammarenaviruses originated ∼23,100-1,880 ya, most likely in Southern Africa. Cophylogenetic analysis indicated that cospeciation did not contribute significantly to mammarenavirus-host associations. Finally, we show that extremely strong selective pressure on the viral polymerase accompanied the speciation of NW viruses. These data suggest that the evolutionary history of mammarenaviruses was not driven by codivergence with their hosts. The viral polymerase should be regarded as a major determinant of mammarenavirus adaptation.

"A total of 53 specimens of the montane grass mouse, Akodon montensis Thomas, 1913 were collected in the Serra dos Órgãos National Park (SONP) in November 2014 and July 2015. The fecal material was analyzed, and a prevalence of 7.5% was recorded for a new coccidian species of the genus Eimeria Schneider, 1875, with part of its endogenous development recorded in the small intestine. The oocysts of a new coccidian species of genus Eimeria are ellipsoidal to subspherical. The wall is bi-layered, c. 1.5 μm (1.3-1.6 μm) thick, outer layer rough. Oocyst (n = 126) mean length is 25.3 μm (21.0-28.0 μm), with a width of 20.2 μm (17.0-22.0 μm) and mean length/width (L:W) ratio of 1.3 (1.2-1.4). Polar granule is present, with the oocyst residuum as a large spherical to subspherical globule. Sporocyst shape (n = 126) is ellipsoidal, with a mean length of 11.8 μm (9.3-14.4 μm), width of 7.9 μm (6.7-9.3 μm), and mean L:W ratio of 1.5 (1.4-1.7). Sporocysts with nipple-like Stieda body and sub-Stieda body are absent. A sporocyst residuum formed by several globules, usually along the sporocyst wall. This is the first record of Eimeria in the montane grass mouse from Brazil.

"American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, is a growing public health problem in Panama, and further forest degradation due to human population growth is expected to worsen the situation. Most people infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are silently ill, and their life expectancy is severely compromised, which contributes to further deterioration of living conditions in endemic regions. Here, we review the outcomes of nearly 100 years of ecological and epidemiological investigation about Chagas disease in Panama, in an attempt to highlight progress, identify needs, and re-orient future efforts. Rhodnius pallescens and Triatoma dimidiata are both primary vectors of T. cruzi in Panama, but R. pallescens seems more efficient in human-altered forest ecosystems due to a greater degree of association with Attalea butyracea. In contrast, T. dimidiata transmits T. cruzi efficiently under more sylvatic conditions (e.g. settlements inside old-growth or secondary forest patches), where its populations reach considerable numbers irrespective of the absence of A. butyracea. A trend of increasing forest degradation, suburbanization, and development of tourism in Panama favoring the establishment of A. butyracea and other palm tree species (Acrocomia sp.) suggests that a colonist species like R. pallescens will continue to play a more prominent role in the transmission of T. cruzi than a forest specialist like T. dimidiata. However, studies about the taxonomic status and ecology of these vectors are still needed in Panama to address their transmission potential fully. The implementation of an active surveillance system and education programs could greatly minimize the risk of Chagas disease transmission in Panama, preventing fatal infections in children from endemic areas.

"South American Akodontini rodents are characterized by a large number of chromosome rearrangements. Among them, the genus Akodon has been extensively analyzed with classical and molecular cytogenetics, which allowed the identification of a large number of intra- and interspecific chromosomal variation due to Robertsonian rearrangements, pericentric inversions, and heterochromatin additions/deletions. In order to shed some light on the cause of these rearrangements, we comparatively analyzed the karyotypes of three Akodontini species, Akodon cursor (2n = 14, FN = 19), A. montensis (2n = 24, FN = 42), and Necromys lasiurus (2n = 34, FN = 34), after GTG- and CBG-banding. The karyotypes differed by Robertsonian rearrangements, pericentric inversions, centromere repositioning, and heterochromatin variation. Genome comparisons were performed through interspecific fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with total genomic DNAs of each species as probes (GISH). Our results revealed considerable conservation of the euchromatic portions among the three karyotypes suggesting that they mostly differ in their heterochromatic regions. FISH was also performed to assess the distribution of telomeric sequences, long and short interspersed repetitive elements (LINE-1 and B1 SINE) and of the endogenous retrovirus mysTR in the genomes of the three species. The results led us to infer that transposable elements have played an important role in the enormous chromosome variation found in Akodontini.

"Equine encephalomyelitis (Eastern and Western) has been assessed according to the criteria of the Animal Health Law (AHL), in particular criteria of Article 7 on disease profile and impacts, Article 5 on the eligibility of equine encephalomyelitis (Eastern and Western) to be listed, Article 9 for the categorisation of equine encephalomyelitis (Eastern and Western) according to disease prevention and control rules as in Annex IV, and Article 8 on the list of animal species related to equine encephalomyelitis (Eastern and Western). The assessment has been performed following a methodology composed of information collection and compilation, expert judgement on each criterion at individual and, if no consensus was reached before, also at collective level. The output is composed of the categorical answer, and for the questions where no consensus was reached, the different supporting views are reported. Details on the methodology used for this assessment are explained in a separate opinion. According to the assessment performed, equine encephalomyelitis (Eastern and Western) can be considered eligible to be listed for Union intervention as laid down in Article 5(3) of the AHL. The disease would comply with the criteria as in Section 5 of Annex IV of the AHL, for the application of the disease prevention and control rules referred to in point (e) of Article 9(1). The assessment here performed on compliance with the criteria as in Section 4 of Annex IV referred to in point (d) of Article 9(1) is inconclusive. The animal species to be listed for equine encephalomyelitis (Eastern and Western) according to Article 8(3) criteria are several species of mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians as susceptible species; rodents, lagomorphs and several bird species as reservoirs and at least four mosquito species (family Culicidae) as vectors.

"Marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) fed a pelleted diet high in sucrose and casein have been used as a model for moderate to severe periodontitis. Here we characterize the prevalence, location, and histopathologic features of food-impaction lesions (FIL), a unique type of oral event, in rice rats fed standard pelleted rodent chow from weaning until 34 wk of age. Healthy female rats (n = 90; age, 4 wk) were weaned into groups (n = 10 to 24) and were euthanized at 4, 16, 22, 28, or 34 wk of age. At necropsy, high-resolution photographs of the 4 jaw quadrants were examined by 3 independent observers to determine the presence, number, and location of FIL. In addition, gross periodontitis was scored (scale, 0 to 4), and the hemimaxillar surface area containing FIL was measured. Serial sections of decalcified jaws were assessed histologically. The prevalence of FIL increased with age, and was 0% (baseline), 59.1%, 69.6%, 81.8% and 80.0% in rats at age 4, 16, 22, 28, and 34 wk, respectively. FIL were predominantly located (93.9%) in the maxillary palatal surfaces of the interproximal area between molars 2 and 3 and did not affect mandibular surfaces. The percentage of the hemimaxillar surface area occupied by FIL was 6.83%, 4.82%, 2.88%, and 6.52% in rats at age 16, 22, 28, and 34 wk, respectively. Histopathologic changes in FIL varied from localized gingivitis to larger, localized periodontitis-like lesions. These data indicate that FIL are common in rice rats fed standard rodent chow, are slight to mild in severity, and are localized to specific regions in the oral cavity, thus suggesting they may be a suitable model for local maxillary periodontitis when fed standard rodent chow.

"Pichinde virus (PICV) is a nonpathogenic arenavirus with a bi-segmented RNA genome (L and S segments) that encodes four viral genes. We have developed a reverse genetics system to generate recombinant tri-segmented PICV (rP18tri) that packages three RNA segments (L, S1, and S2) and can encode up to two foreign genes. Using influenza virus HA and NP as model antigens, we show that the rP18tri vector can induce strong humoral and cell-mediated immunity, which further increases upon a booster dose. We propose that this novel rP18tri vector can be developed into a useful vaccine platform for other antigens, particularly when strong cellular immunity and prime-boost vaccination strategy are desired.

"The spirochaete (Borrelia burgdorferi) associated with Lyme disease was detected in questing ticks and rodents during a period of 18 years, 1991-2009, at five locations on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) was collected at varied intervals between 1991 and 2009 and examined for B. burgdorferi. The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), house mouse (Mus musculus) marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris), marsh rabbit (Sylvilagus palustris), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) and six-lined racerunner (Cnemidophorus sexlineatus) were live-trapped, and their tissues cultured to isolate spirochaetes. Borrelia burgdorferi isolates were obtained from questing adult I. scapularis and engorged I. scapularis removed from P. leucopus, O. palustris and S. floridanus. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi infection was variable at different times and sites ranging from 7 to 14% of examined questing I. scapularis. Mitochondrial (16S) rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis from 65 adult I. scapularis identified 12 haplotypes in two major clades. Nine haplotypes were associated with northern/Midwestern I. scapularis populations and three with southern I. scapularis populations. Sixteen isolates obtained from tick hosts in 2005 were confirmed to be B. burgdorferi by amplifying and sequencing of 16S rRNA and 5S-23S intergenic spacer fragments. The sequences had 98-99% identity to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains B31, JD1 and M11p. Taken together, these studies indicate that B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is endemic in questing I. scapularis and mammalian tick hosts on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

"For transmission of a virus to occur, a virus must enter a host through a portal of entry, replicate or disseminate within the host, and be transmitted to a new host through a portal of exit. Unless delivered directly into bodily tissues through a bite or needle, most viruses interact with the epithelium at the site of entry. Localized infections replicate at the initial site of infection, while systemic infections spread to additional areas of the body. Viruses are shed into the environment most often through the same route they entered the body. The stability of virions within the environment is dependent upon virion and environmental factors. Epidemiology is the study of how diseases are transmitted through a population. Epidemiologists perform descriptive or analytic studies to characterize the chain of viral infection throughout a population and design control measures to interrupt it.

"During the replication cycle of double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) replicates and transcribes the viral genome from within the viral capsid. How the RdRP molecules are packaged within the virion and how they function within the confines of an intact capsid are intriguing questions with answers that most likely vary across the different dsRNA virus families. In this study, we have determined a 2.4 Å resolution structure of an RdRP from the human picobirnavirus (hPBV). In addition to the conserved polymerase fold, the hPBV RdRP possesses a highly flexible 24 amino acid loop structure located near the C-terminus of the protein that is inserted into its active site. In vitro RNA polymerization assays and site-directed mutagenesis showed that: (1) the hPBV RdRP is fully active using both ssRNA and dsRNA templates; (2) the insertion loop likely functions as an assembly platform for the priming nucleotide to allow de novo initiation; (3) RNA transcription by the hPBV RdRP proceeds in a semi-conservative manner; and (4) the preference of virus-specific RNA during transcription is dictated by the lower melting temperature associated with the terminal sequences. Co-expression of the hPBV RdRP and the capsid protein (CP) indicated that, under the conditions used, the RdRP could not be incorporated into the recombinant capsids in the absence of the viral genome. Additionally, the hPBV RdRP exhibited higher affinity towards the conserved 5'-terminal sequence of the viral RNA, suggesting that the RdRP molecules may be encapsidated through their specific binding to the viral RNAs during assembly.

"Published reports of spontaneous neoplasia in marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) are sparse. We report here a case of cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma in a 14-mo-old marsh rice rat that involved the ear pinnae, with dissemination to the liver and spleen. Histologically, the thickened ear pinnae showed diffuse infiltration of neoplastic lymphocytes into the epidermis, dermis, and adnexal skin structures, with Pautrier microaggregations present in the epidermis. In addition, neoplastic lymphocytes were observed infiltrating and disrupting the architecture of the liver and spleen. Neoplastic lymphocytes were strongly positive for the T-cell marker CD3 but were negative for the B-cell markers CD19 and CD20. These histologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with an epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma, as previously reported in other species, including humans. To our knowledge, this report represents the first published case of spontaneous cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma in a marsh rice rat.

"Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a multifactorial disease in patients with primary or metastatic bone malignancy or osteoporosis undergoing systemic antiresorptive therapy, where pathophysiology has not yet been fully determined. The staging of ONJ is based on severity of symptoms and extent of clinical and radiographic findings. Treatment strategies range from conservative local wound care to aggressive resective surgery of all necrotic bone. The first ONJ cases were reported in 2003 and 2004, and although significant progress has been made in our understanding of the disease, much more work needs to be done to completely explain its pathophysiology.

"Trypanosoma cruzi is the aetiological agent of Chagas disease, which affects approximately eight million people in the Americas. This parasite exhibits genetic variability, with at least six discrete typing units broadly distributed in the American continent. T. cruzi I (TcI) shows remarkable genetic diversity; a genotype linked to human infections and a domestic cycle of transmission have recently been identified, hence, this strain was named TcIDom. The aim of this work was to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of TcI subpopulations across humans, insect vectors and mammalian reservoirs in Colombia by means of molecular typing targeting the spliced leader intergenic region of mini-exon gene. We analysed 101 TcI isolates and observed a distribution of sylvatic TcI in 70% and TcIDom in 30%. In humans, the ratio was sylvatic TcI in 60% and TcIDom in 40%. In mammal reservoirs, the distribution corresponded to sylvatic TcI in 96% and TcIDom in 4%. Among insect vectors, sylvatic TcI was observed in 48% and TcIDom in 52%. In conclusion, the circulation of TcIDom is emerging in Colombia and this genotype is still adapting to the domestic cycle of transmission. The epidemiological and clinical implications of these findings are discussed herein.

"Endogenous retroviruses (ERV), or the remnants of past retroviral infections that are no longer active, are found in the genomes of most vertebrates, typically constituting approximately 10% of the genome. In some vertebrates, particularly in shorter-lived species like rodents, it is not unusual to find active endogenous retroviruses. In longer-lived species, including humans where substantial effort has been invested in searching for active ERVs, it is unusual to find them; to date none have been found in humans. Presumably the chance of detecting an active ERV infection is a function of the length of an ERV epidemic. Intuitively, given that ERVs or signatures of past ERV infections are passed from parents to offspring, we might expect to detect more active ERVs in species with longer generation times, as it should take more years for an infection to run its course in longer than in shorter lived species. This means the observation of more active ERV infections in shorter compared to longer-lived species is paradoxical. We explore this paradox using a modeling approach to investigate factors that influence ERV epidemic length. Our simple epidemiological model may explain why we find evidence of active ERV infections in shorter rather than longer-lived species.

"Rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) are a recognized animal model for studying periodontal disease and the photoperiodic regulation of reproduction. Here we share information regarding the breeding, husbandry, veterinary care, and hematologic findings about this animal species to facilitate its use in studies at other research institutions. Rice rats initially were quarantined and monitored for excluded pathogens by using microbiologic, parasitologic, and serologic methods with adult female Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus sentinel animals. Breeders were paired in a monogamous, continuous-breeding system. Rats were housed in static filter-top cages, maintained on commercial chow under 14:10-h light:dark cycles at 68 to 79 °F (20.0 to 26.1 °C) and 30% to 70% humidity. Rice rats apparently adapt relatively well to standard laboratory conditions, despite their aggressive behavior toward conspecifics and humans. Our analysis of 97 litters revealed that dams gave birth to an average of 5.2 pups per dam and weaned 4.2 pups per dam. Several procedures and biologic reagents normally used in standard laboratory rodents (mice and rats) can be used with rice rats. In addition, we present hematologic and serum chemistry values that can be used as preliminary reference values for future studies involving rice rats.

"The genus Orbivirus of the family Reoviridae comprises 22 virus species including the Changuinola virus (CGLV) serogroup. The complete genome sequences of 13 CGLV serotypes isolated between 1961 and 1988 from distinct geographical areas of the Brazilian Amazon region were obtained. All viral sequences were obtained from single-passaged CGLV strains grown in Vero cells. CGLVs are the only orbiviruses known to be transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. Ultrastructure and molecular analysis by electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis, respectively, revealed viral particles with typical orbivirus size and morphology, as well as the presence of a segmented genome with 10 segments. Full-length nucleotide sequencing of each of the ten RNA segments of the 13 CGLV serotypes provided basic information regarding the genome organization, encoded proteins and genetic traits. Segment 2 (encoding VP2) of the CGLV is uncommonly larger in comparison to those found in other orbiviruses and shows varying sizes even among different CGLV serotypes. Phylogenetic analysis support previous serological findings, which indicate that CGLV constitutes a separate serogroup within the genus Orbivirus. In addition, six out of 13 analysed CGLV serotypes showed reassortment of their genome segments.

"Picobirnavirus (PBV) which has been included in the list of viruses causing enteric infection in animals is highly versatile because of its broad host range and genetic diversity. PBVs are among the most recent and emerging small, nonenveloped viruses with a bisegmented double-stranded RNA genome, classified under a new family ""Picobirnaviridae."" PBVs have also been detected from respiratory tract of pigs, but needs further close investigation for their inhabitant behavior. Though, accretion of genomic data of PBVs from different mammalian species resolved some of the ambiguity, quite a few questions and hypotheses regarding pathogenesis, persistence location, and evolution of PBVs remain unreciprocated. Evolutionary analysis reveals association of PBVs with partitiviruses especially fungi partitiviruses. Although, PBVs may have an ambiguous clinical implication, they do pose a potential public health concern in humans and control of PBVs mainly relies on nonvaccinal approach. Based upon the published data, from 1988 to date, generated from animal PBVs across the globe, this review provides information and discussion with respect to genetic analysis as well as evolution of PBVs of animal origin in relation to human strains.

"Although L1 sequences are present in the genomes of all placental mammals and marsupials examined to date, their activity was lost in the megabat family, Pteropodidae, ∼24 million years ago. To examine the characteristics of L1s prior to their extinction, we analyzed the evolutionary history of L1s in the genome of a megabat, Pteropus vampyrus, and found a pattern of periodic L1 expansion and quiescence. In contrast to the well-characterized L1s in human and mouse, megabat genomes have accommodated two or more simultaneously active L1 families throughout their evolutionary history, and major peaks of L1 deposition into the genome always involved multiple families. We compared the consensus sequences of the two major megabat L1 families at the time of their extinction to consensus L1s of a variety of mammalian species. Megabat L1s are comparable to the other mammalian L1s in terms of adenosine content and conserved amino acids in the open reading frames (ORFs). However, the intergenic region (IGR) of the reconstructed element from the more active family is dramatically longer than the IGR of well-characterized human and mouse L1s. We synthesized the reconstructed element from this L1 family and tested the ability of its components to support retrotransposition in a tissue culture assay. Both ORFs are capable of supporting retrotransposition, while the IGR is inhibitory to retrotransposition, especially when combined with either of the reconstructed ORFs. We dissected the inhibitory effect of the IGR by testing truncated and shuffled versions and found that length is a key factor, but not the only one affecting inhibition of retrotransposition. Although the IGR is inhibitory to retrotransposition, this inhibition does not account for the extinction of L1s in megabats. Overall, the evolution of the L1 sequence or the quiescence of L1 is unlikely the reason of L1 extinction.

"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira, is a zoonosis with important impacts on human and animal health worldwide. Research on the mechanisms of Leptospira pathogenesis has been hindered due to slow growth of infectious strains, poor transformability, and a paucity of genetic tools. As a result of second generation sequencing technologies, there has been an acceleration of leptospiral genome sequencing efforts in the past decade, which has enabled a concomitant increase in functional genomics analyses of Leptospira pathogenesis. A pathogenomics approach, by coupling of pan-genomic analysis of multiple isolates with sequencing of experimentally attenuated highly pathogenic Leptospira, has resulted in the functional inference of virulence factors. The global Leptospira Genome Project supported by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to which key scientific contributions have been made from the international leptospirosis research community has provided a new roadmap for comprehensive studies of Leptospira and leptospirosis well into the future. This review describes functional genomics approaches to apply the data generated by the Leptospira Genome Project towards deepening our knowledge of virulence factors of Leptospira using the emerging discipline of pathogenomics.

"Picobirnavirus (PBV) is a small, non-enveloped, bisegmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus of vertebrate hosts. The name 'Picobirnavirus' derives from the prefix 'pico' (latin for 'small') in reference to the small virion size, plus the prefix 'bi' (latin for 'two') and the word 'RNA' to indicate the nature of the viral genome. The serendipitous discovery of PBV dates back to 1988 from Brazil, when human fecal samples collected during the acute gastroenteritis outbreaks were subjected for routine rotavirus surveillance by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and silver straining (S/S). The PAGE gels after silver staining showed a typical 'two RNA band' pattern, and it was identified as Picobirnavirus. Likewise, the feces of wild black-footed pigmy rice rats (Oryzomys nigripes) subjected for PAGE assay by the same research group in Brazil reported the presence of PBV (Pereira et al., J Gen Virol 69:2749-2754, 1988). PBVs have been detected in faeces of humans and wide range of animal species with or without diarrhoea, worldwide. The probable role of PBV as either a 'primary diarrhoeal agent' in 'immunocompetent children'; or a 'potential pathogen' in 'immunocompromised individuals' or an 'innocuous virus' in the intestine remains elusive and needs to be investigated despite the numerous reports of the presence of PBV in fecal samples of various species of domestic mammals, wild animals, birds and snakes; our current knowledge of their biology, etiology, pathogenicity or their transmission characteristics remains subtle. This review aims to analyse the veterinary and zoonotic aspects of animal Picobirnavirus infections since its discovery.

"In 2010, vaccinia virus caused an outbreak of bovine vaccinia that affected dairy cattle and rural workers in Pará State, Brazil. Genetic analyses identified the virus as distinct from BeAn58058 vaccinia virus (identified in 1960s) and from smallpox vaccine virus strains. These findings suggest spread of autochthonous group 1 vaccinia virus in this region.

"In the past 20 years of surveillance for hantavirus in humans in the United States, 624 cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) have been reported, 96% of which occurred in states west of the Mississippi River. Most hantavirus infections are caused by Sin Nombre virus, but cases of HPS caused by Bayou, Black Creek Canal, Monongahela, and New York viruses have been reported, and cases of domestically acquired hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome caused by Seoul virus have also occurred. Rarely, hantavirus infections result in mild illness that does not progress to HPS. Continued testing and surveillance of clinical cases in humans will improve our understanding of the etiologic agents involved and the spectrum of diseases.

"Wildlife species are identified as an important source of emerging zoonotic disease. Accordingly, public health programs have attempted to expand in scope to include a greater focus on wildlife and its role in zoonotic disease outbreaks. Zoonotic disease transmission dynamics involving wildlife are complex and nonlinear, presenting a number of challenges. First, empirical characterization of wildlife host species and pathogen systems are often lacking, and insight into one system may have little application to another involving the same host species and pathogen. Pathogen transmission characterization is difficult due to the changing nature of population size and density associated with wildlife hosts. Infectious disease itself may influence wildlife population demographics through compensatory responses that may evolve, such as decreased age to reproduction. Furthermore, wildlife reservoir dynamics can be complex, involving various host species and populations that may vary in their contribution to pathogen transmission and persistence over space and time. Mathematical models can provide an important tool to engage these complex systems, and there is an urgent need for increased computational focus on the coupled dynamics that underlie pathogen spillover at the human-wildlife interface. Often, however, scientists conducting empirical studies on emerging zoonotic disease do not have the necessary skill base to choose, develop, and apply models to evaluate these complex systems. How do modeling frameworks differ and what considerations are important when applying modeling tools to the study of zoonotic disease? Using zoonotic disease examples, we provide an overview of several common approaches and general considerations important in the modeling of wildlife-associated zoonoses.

"Junín virus, the etiological agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, causes significant morbidity and mortality. The virus is spread through the aerosolization of host rodent excreta and endemic to the humid pampas of Argentina. Recently, significant progress has been achieved with the development of new technologies (e.g. reverse genetics) that have expanded knowledge about the pathogenesis and viral replication of Junín virus. We will review the pathogenesis of Junín virus in various animal models and the role of innate and adaptive immunity during infection. We will highlight current research regarding the role of molecular biology of Junín virus in elucidating virus attenuation. We will also summarize current knowledge on Junín virus pathogenesis focusing on the recent development of vaccines and potential therapeutics.

"Arenaviruses are enveloped, bipartite negative single-stranded RNA viruses that can cause a wide spectrum of disease in humans and experimental animals including hemorrhagic fever. The majority of these viruses are rodent-borne and the arenavirus family can be divided into two groups: the Lassa-Lymphocytic choriomeningitis serocomplex and the Tacaribe serocomplex. Arenavirus-induced disease may include characteristic symptoms ranging from fever, malaise, body aches, petechiae, dehydration, hemorrhage, organ failure, shock, and in severe cases death. Currently, there are few prophylactic and therapeutic treatments available for arenavirus-induced symptoms. Supportive care and ribavirin remain the predominant strategies for treating most of the arenavirus-induced diseases. Therefore, efficacy testing of novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies in relevant animal models is necessary. Because of the potential for person-to-person spread, the ability to cause lethal or debilitating disease in humans, limited treatment options, and potential as a bio-weapon, the development of prophylactics and therapeutics is essential. This article reviews the current arenavirus animal models and prophylactic and therapeutic strategies under development to treat arenavirus infection.

"BACKGROUND: In the Eastern and Upper Midwestern regions of North America, Ixodes scapularis (L.) is the most abundant tick species encountered by humans and the primary vector of B. burgdorferi, whereas in the southeastern region Amblyomma americanum (Say) is the most abundant tick species encountered by humans but cannot transmit B. burgdorferi. Surveys of Borreliae in ticks have been conducted in the southeastern United States and often these surveys identify B. lonestari as the primary Borrelia species, surveys have not included Arkansas ticks, canines, or white-tailed deer and B. lonestari is not considered pathogenic. The objective of this study was to identify Borrelia species within Arkansas by screening ticks (n=2123), canines (n=173), and white-tailed deer (n=228) to determine the identity and locations of Borreliae endemic to Arkansas using PCR amplification of the flagellin (flaB) gene. METHODS: Field collected ticks from canines and from hunter-killed white-tailed were identified to species and life stage. After which, ticks and their hosts were screened for the presence of Borrelia using PCR to amplify the flaB gene. A subset of the positive samples was confirmed with bidirectional sequencing. RESULTS: In total 53 (21.2%) white-tailed deer, ten (6%) canines, and 583 (27.5%) Ixodid ticks (252 Ixodes scapularis, 161 A. americanum, 88 Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 50 Amblyomma maculatum, 19 Dermacentor variabilis, and 13 unidentified Amblyomma species) produced a Borrelia flaB amplicon. Of the positive ticks, 324 (22.7%) were collected from canines (151 A. americanum, 78 R. sanguineus, 43 I. scapularis, 26 A. maculatum, 18 D. variabilis, and 8 Amblyomma species) and 259 (37.2%) were collected from white-tailed deer (209 I. scapularis, 24 A. maculatum, 10 A. americanum, 10 R. sanguineus, 1 D. variabilis, and 5 Amblyomma species). None of the larvae were PCR positive. A majority of the flaB amplicons were homologous with B. lonestari sequences: 281 of the 296 sequenced ticks, 3 canines, and 27 deer. Only 22 deer, 7 canines, and 15 tick flaB amplicons (12 I. scapularis, 2 A. maculatum, and 1 Amblyomma species) were homologous with B. burgdorferi sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study identified multiple Borreliae genotypes in Arkansas ticks, canines and deer including B. burgdorferi and B. lonestari; however, B. lonestari was significantly more prevalent in the tick population than B. burgdorferi. Results from this study suggest that the majority of tick-borne diseases in Arkansas are not B. burgdorferi.

"Leopardus braccatus (Cope, 1889) is a small felid—not much larger than a domestic house cat—commonly called the Pantanal cat. No comprehensive surveys have been conducted to determine how many L. braccatus exist in the wild. It is found in humid, warm grasslands and wooded areas of extreme northwestern Argentina, southwestern and south- and north-central (newly reported ranges) Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Habitat loss and degradation are considered major threats throughout most of its range. It is uncommon in captivity and museum collections, listed with all Felidae under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and considered “Near Threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources in the pampas cat group ( = L. colocolo).

"As part of a field ecology study of arbovirus and malaria activity in the Amazon Basin, Loreto Department, Peru, we collected mosquitoes landing on humans at a forest site and inside and outside of residences and military barracks at periurban, rural, and village sites. We collected 11 Anopheles spp. from these four sites. An. darlingi, the principal malaria vector in the region, accounted for 98.7% of all Anopheles spp. collected at Puerto Almendra. Peaks in landing activity occurred during the December and April collection periods. However, the percent of sporozoite-positive Anopheles spp. was highest 1-2 months later, when landing activity decreased to approximately 10% of the peak activity periods. At all sites, peak landing activity occurred about 2 hours after sunset. These data provide a better understanding of the taxonomy, population density, and seasonal and habitat distribution of potential malaria vectors within the Amazon Basin region.

"Mammalian retrotransposons, transposable elements that are processed through an RNA intermediate, are categorized as short interspersed elements (SINEs), long interspersed elements (LINEs), and long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, which include endogenous retroviruses. The ability of transposable elements to autonomously amplify led to their initial characterization as selfish or junk DNA; however, it is now known that they may acquire specific cellular functions in a genome and are implicated in host defense mechanisms as well as in genome evolution. Interactions between classes of transposable elements may exert a markedly different and potentially more significant effect on a genome than interactions between members of a single class of transposable elements. We examined the genomic structure and evolution of the kangaroo endogenous retrovirus (KERV) in the marsupial genus Macropus. The complete proviral structure of the kangaroo endogenous retrovirus, phylogenetic relationship among relative retroviruses, and expression of this virus in both Macropus rufogriseus and M. eugenii are presented for the first time. In addition, we show the relative copy number and distribution of the kangaroo endogenous retrovirus in the Macropus genus. Our data indicate that amplification of the kangaroo endogenous retrovirus occurred in a lineage-specific fashion, is restricted to the centromeres, and is not correlated with LINE depletion. Finally, analysis of KERV long terminal repeat sequences using massively parallel sequencing indicates that the recent amplification in M. rufogriseus is likely due to duplications and concerted evolution rather than a high number of independent insertion events.

"Ulcerative dermatitis (UD) is a genetically linked syndrome that affects the neck, torso, and facial regions of C57BL/6 mice and strains with C57BL/6 background. In this study, 96 mice with skin ulcerations in 3 different regions of the body and 40 control animals without ulcerated lesions were evaluated histologically for the presence of hair-induced inflammation in the oronasal cavity. We found that 73.5% (100 of 136) of the mice had hair-induced periodontitis, glossitis, or rhinitis regardless of the presence or absence of UD. Of those mice with UD, 93.9% had hair-induced oronasal inflammation. The mandibular incisors were the most commonly affected site (64.6%), followed by the maxillary molars (20.8%), maxillary incisors (16.7%), tongue (16.7%), nasal cavity (10.4%), and mandibular molars (7.3%). In addition, oronasal hair-induced inflammation occurred in 25% (10 of 40) of the control mice. Here we show a significant association between UD and hair-induced inflammatory lesions of the oronasal cavities.

"Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) is an emerging infectious disease in Latin America. Outbreaks have been recorded for decades in countries with enzootic circulation, and the recent implementation of surveillance systems has allowed the detection of additional human cases in countries and areas with previously unknown VEE activity. Clinically, VEE is indistinguishable from dengue and other arboviral diseases and confirmatory diagnosis requires the use of specialized laboratory tests that are difficult to afford in resource-limited regions. Thus, the disease burden of endemic VEE in developing countries remains largely unknown, but recent surveillance suggests that it may represent up to 10% of the dengue burden in neotropical cities, or tens-of-thousands of cases per year throughout Latin America. The potential emergence of epizootic viruses from enzootic progenitors further highlights the need to strengthen surveillance activities, identify mosquito vectors and reservoirs and develop effective strategies to control the disease. In this article, we provide an overview of the current status of endemic VEE that results from spillover of the enzootic cycles, and we discuss public health measures for disease control as well as future avenues for VEE research.

"BACKGROUND: Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) associated with viral gastroenteritis were reported from humans and several animal species to date. PBVs belonging to family Picobirnaviridae under proposed order Diplornavirales are small, non-enveloped, with bisegmented dsRNA genome. METHODS: PBV was detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and silver staining. Confirmatory RT-PCR using primer pair PicoB25 (+) and PicoB43 (-) for genogroup I PBV and PicoB23(+) and PicoB24(-) for genogroup II PBV, resulted in amplicons of 201bp and 369bp respectively. The amplicons of genogroup I PBV were cloned and sequenced; amplicon of genogroup II PBV was directly sequenced. Further, the phylogenetic relationship and genetic diversity of strains from Kolkata was compared with hitherto reported PBV strains. RESULTS: In PAGE, a faecal specimen showed three sets of PBV with large profile bisegmented genomic RNA with slight variation in migration pattern. Molecular cloning experiments confirmed that PBV/ Human/INDIA/GPBV6/2007 had mixed infection comprising four different strains of PBV genogroup I [GPBV6C1P-GPBV6C4P] and one PBV genogroup II strain [GPBV6G2P]. CONCLUSION: Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of gene segment 2 of GPBV6 clones (C1, C2, C3 and C4) revealed low nucleotide identities (59-63%) and distant genetic relatedness to other human and porcine genogroup I picobirnaviruses. The strain GPBV6G2P represents another PBV genogroup II strain after prototype strain 4-GA-91/USA as genogroup II PBVs have seldom been reported to date, except from Kolkata, India and Netherlands. We are reporting the first incidence of detection of multiple strain (mixed) infection of picobirnavirus [genogroups I and II] from a diarrhoeic child in a slum community of Kolkata, India.

"Viral enteric disease is an ongoing economic burden to poultry producers worldwide, and despite considerable research, no single virus has emerged as a likely causative agent and target for prevention and control efforts. Historically, electron microscopy has been used to identify suspect viruses, with many small, round viruses eluding classification based solely on morphology. National and regional surveys using molecular diagnostics have revealed that suspect viruses continuously circulate in United States poultry, with many viruses appearing concomitantly and in healthy birds. High-throughput nucleic acid pyrosequencing is a powerful diagnostic technology capable of determining the full genomic repertoire present in a complex environmental sample. We utilized the Roche/454 Life Sciences GS-FLX platform to compile an RNA virus metagenome from turkey flocks experiencing enteric disease. This approach yielded numerous sequences homologous to viruses in the BLAST nr protein database, many of which have not been described in turkeys. Our analysis of this turkey gut RNA metagenome focuses in particular on the turkey-origin members of the Picornavirales, the Caliciviridae, and the turkey Picobirnaviruses.

"Merino Walk virus (MWV), a proposed novel tentative species of the family Arenaviridae, was isolated from a rodent, Myotomys unisulcatus, collected at Merino Walk, Eastern Cape, South Africa, in 1985. Full-length genomic sequence confirmed MWV as an arenavirus related distantly to Mobala, Mopeia and Ippy viruses, all members of the Old World arenavirus complex. We propose MWV as a tentative novel species in the Lassa-lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus complex, based on its isolation from a novel rodent species and its genetic and serological characteristics.

"Arboviruses are transmitted in nature exclusively or to a major extend by arthropods. They belong to the most important viruses invading new areas in the world and their occurrence is strongly influenced by climatic changes due to the life cycle of the transmitting vectors. Several arboviruses have emerged in new regions of the world during the last years, like West Nile virus (WNV) in the Americas, Usutu virus (USUV) in Central Europe, or Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in the Arabian Peninsula. In most instances the ways of introduction of arboviruses into new regions are not known. Infections acquired during stays in the tropics and subtropics are diagnosed with increasing frequency in travellers returning from tropical countries, but interestingly no attention is paid on accompanying pet animals or the hematophagous ectoparasites that may still be attached to them. Here we outline the known ecology of the mosquito-borne equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV, EEEV, and VEEV), WNV, USUV, RVFV, and Japanese Encephalitis virus, as well as Tick-Borne Encephalitis virus and its North American counterpart Powassan virus, and will discuss the most likely mode that these viruses could expand their respective geographical range. All these viruses have a different epidemiology as different vector species, reservoir hosts and virus types have adapted to promiscuous and robust or rather very fine-balanced transmission cycles. Consequently, these viruses will behave differently with regard to the requirements needed to establish new endemic foci outside their original geographical ranges. Hence, emphasis is given on animal trade and suitable ecologic conditions, including competent vectors and vertebrate hosts.

"Although other hantaviruses are associated with renal manifestations, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) has not been associated with such sequelae. The HCPS survivors were prospectively evaluated for renal complications. Subjects underwent yearly evaluation, laboratory studies, and 24-hour urine collection. Thirty subjects were evaluated after recovery from HCPS with the first follow-up at a median of 7.4 months after discharge. Subjects were a wide age range (18-51) but had an equal gender composition. Eighteen of 30 (60%) returned for > 1 evaluation. Half (15/30) had a 24-hour urine collection with > 150 mg of total protein and 6 had > 300 mg. Seven had a Cockcroft-Gault creatinine clearance (CrClCG) < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 2 were < 60. Fifty-three percent met the definition of chronic kidney disease. Those treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation had less renal sequelae (P = 0.035). Our data suggest that renal sequelae may occur in HCPS. Further study of renal complications of New World hantavirus infections are needed.

"Enzootic strains of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) have been isolated from febrile patients in the Peruvian Amazon Basin at low but consistent levels since the early 1990s. Through a clinic-based febrile surveillance program, we detected an outbreak of VEEV infections in Iquitos, Peru, in the first half of 2006. The majority of these patients resided within urban areas of Iquitos, with no report of recent travel outside the city. To characterize the risk factors for VEEV infection within the city, an antibody prevalence study was carried out in a geographically stratified sample of urban areas of Iquitos. Additionally, entomological surveys were conducted to determine if previously incriminated vectors of enzootic VEEV were present within the city. We found that greater than 23% of Iquitos residents carried neutralizing antibodies against VEEV, with significant associations between increased antibody prevalence and age, occupation, mosquito net use, and overnight travel. Furthermore, potential vector mosquitoes were widely distributed across the city. Our results suggest that while VEEV infection is more common in rural areas, transmission also occurs within urban areas of Iquitos, and that further studies are warranted to identify the precise vectors and reservoirs involved in urban VEEV transmission.

"Phylogenetic reconstructions are often plagued by difficulties in distinguishing phylogenetic signal (due to shared ancestry) from phylogenetic noise or homoplasy (due to character-state convergences or reversals). We use a new interpretive hypothesis, termed hemiplasy, to show how random lineage sorting might account for specific instances of seeming ""phylogenetic discordance"" among different chromosomal traits, or between karyotypic features and probable species phylogenies. We posit that hemiplasy is generally less likely for underdominant chromosomal polymorphisms (i.e., those with heterozygous disadvantage) than for neutral polymorphisms or especially for overdominant rearrangements (which should tend to be longer-lived), and we illustrate this concept by using examples from chiropterans and afrotherians. Chromosomal states are especially powerful in phylogenetic reconstructions because they offer strong signatures of common ancestry, but their evolutionary interpretations remain fully subject to the principles of cladistics and the potential complications of hemiplasy.

"Thottapalayam (TPM) virus belongs to the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae. The genomes of hantaviruses consist of three negative-stranded RNA segments (S, M and L) encoding the virus nucleocapsid (N), glycoprotein (Gn, Gc), and polymerase (L) proteins, respectively. The genus Hantavirus contains predominantly rodent-borne viruses, with the prominent exception of TPM virus which was isolated in India in 1964 from an insectivore, Suncus murinus, commonly referred to as the Asian house shrew or brown musk shrew. Analysis of the available TPM virus S (1530 nt) RNA genome segment sequence and the newly derived M (3621 nt) and L (6581 nt) segment sequences demonstrate that the entire TPM virus genome is very unique. Remarkably high sequence differences are seen at the nucleotide (up to S - 47%, M - 49%, L - 38%) and protein (up to N - 54%, Gn/Gc - 57% and L - 39%) levels relative to the rodent-borne hantaviruses, consistent with TPM virus having a unique host association.

"In recent years, viruses have been recognized increasingly as an important cause of foodborne infections. More than 160 enteric viruses are excreted in the feces of infected individuals, and some may also be present in the vomitus. Food and water are directly contaminated with fecal material, through the use of sewage sludge in agriculture, sewage pollution of shellfish culture beds, or may be contaminated by infected food-handlers.
"
"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is an emerging disease of humans that is carried by wild rodents. Humans are usually exposed to the virus through geographically isolated outbreaks. The driving forces behind these outbreaks is poorly understood. Certainly, one key driver of the emergence of these viruses is the virus population dynamics within the rodent population. Two new mathematical models for hantavirus infection in rodents are formulated and studied. The new models include the dynamics of susceptible, exposed, infective, and recovered male and female rodents. The first model is a system of ordinary differential equations while the second model is a system of stochastic differential equations. These new models capture some of the realistic dynamics of the male/female rodent hantavirus interaction: higher seroprevalence in males and variability in seroprevalence levels.

"Five years after the apparent end of the major 1995 Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) epizootic/epidemic, focal outbreaks of equine encephalitis occurred in Carabobo and Barinas States of western Venezuela. Virus isolates from horses in each location were nearly identical in sequence to 1995 isolates, which suggests natural persistence of subtype IC VEE virus (VEEV) strains in a genetically stable mode. Serologic evidence indicated that additional outbreaks occurred in Barinas State in 2003. Field studies identified known Culex (Melanoconion) spp. vectors and reservoir hosts of enzootic VEEV but a dearth of typical epidemic vectors. Cattle serosurveys indicated the recent circulation of enzootic VEEV strains, and possibly of epizootic strains. Persistence of VEEV subtype IC strains and infection of horses at the end of the rainy season suggest the possibility of an alternative, cryptic transmission cycle involving survival through the dry season of infected vectors or persistently infected vertebrates.

"To date, no molecular studies on group C viruses (Bunyaviridae, Orthobunyavirus) have been published. We determined the complete small RNA (SRNA) segment and partial medium RNA segment nucleotide sequences for 13 group C members. The full-length SRNA sequences ranged from 915 to 926 nucleotides in length, and revealed similar organization in comparison with other orthobunyaviruses. Based on the 705 nucleotides of the N gene, group C members were distributed into three major phylogenetic groups, with the exception of Madrid virus, which was placed outside of these three groups. Analysis of the Caraparu virus strain BeH 5546 revealed that it has an SRNA sequence nearly identical to that of Oriboca virus and is a natural reassortant virus. In addition, analysis of 345 nucleotides of the Gn gene for eight group C viruses and for strain BeH 5546 revealed a different phylogenetic topology, suggesting a reassortment pattern among them. These findings represent the first evidence for natural reassortment among the group C viruses, which include several human pathogens. Furthermore, our genetic data corroborate previous relationships determined using serologic assays (complement fixation, hemagglutination inhibition, and neutralization tests) and suggest that a combination of informative molecular, serological, and ecological data is a helpful tool to understand the molecular epidemiology of arboviruses.

"BACKGROUND: Two common southern African mice species, Mastomys coucha and M. natalensis, are widely distributed throughout the subregion and overlap in many areas. They also share a high degree of morphological similarity, making them impossible to distinguish in the field at present. These multimammate mice are documented carriers of serious disease vectors causing Lassa fever, plague and encephalomyocarditis, which coupled to their cohabitation with humans in many areas, could pose a significant health risk. A preliminary study reported the presence of isozyme markers at three loci (GPI-2, PT-2, -3) in one population each of M. coucha and M. natalensis. Two additional populations (from the Vaal Dam and Richards Bay) were sampled to determine the reliability of these markers, and to seek additional genetic markers. RESULTS: Fifteen proteins or enzymes provided interpretable results at a total of 39 loci. Additional fixed allele differences between the species were detected at AAT-1, ADH, EST-1, PGD-1, Hb-1 and -2. Average heterozygosities for M. coucha and M. natalensis were calculated as 0.018 and 0.032 respectively, with a mean genetic distance between the species of 0.26. CONCLUSIONS: The confirmation of the isozyme and the detection of the additional allozyme markers are important contributions to the identification of these two medical and agricultural pest species.

"The arenavirus Lassa virus causes Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in the countries of Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea and perhaps elsewhere in West Africa. To determine the degree of genetic diversity among Lassa virus strains, partial nucleoprotein (NP) gene sequences were obtained from 54 strains and analyzed. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Lassa viruses comprise four lineages, three of which are found in Nigeria and the fourth in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Overall strain variation in the partial NP gene sequence was found to be as high as 27% at the nucleotide level and 15% at the amino acid level. Genetic distance among Lassa strains was found to correlate with geographic distance rather than time, and no evidence of a ""molecular clock"" was found. A method for amplifying and cloning full-length arenavirus S RNAs was developed and used to obtain the complete NP and glycoprotein gene (GP1 and GP2) sequences for two representative Nigerian strains of Lassa virus. Comparison of full-length gene sequences for four Lassa virus strains representing the four lineages showed that the NP gene (up to 23.8% nucleotide difference and 12.0% amino acid difference) is more variable than the glycoprotein genes. Although the evolutionary order of descent within Lassa virus strains was not completely resolved, the phylogenetic analyses of full-length NP, GP1, and GP2 gene sequences suggested that Nigerian strains of Lassa virus were ancestral to strains from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Compared to the New World arenaviruses, Lassa and the other Old World arenaviruses have either undergone a shorter period of diverisification or are evolving at a slower rate. This study represents the first large-scale examination of Lassa virus genetic variation.

"A mark-recapture longitudinal study of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to Sin Nombre virus (SNV) in rodent populations in western Colorado (1994-results summarized to October 1997) indicates the presence of SNV or a closely related hantavirus at two sites. Most rodents (principally deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, and pinyon mice, P. truei) did not persist on the trapping webs much beyond 1 month after first capture. Some persisted more than 1 year, which suggests that even a few infected deer mice could serve as transseasonal reservoirs and mechanisms for over-winter virus maintenance. A positive association between wounds and SNV antibody in adult animals at both sites suggests that when infected rodents in certain populations fight with uninfected rodents, virus amplification occurs. At both sites, male rodents comprised a larger percentage of seropositive mice than recaptured mice, which suggests that male mice contribute more to the SNV epizootic cycle than female mice. In deer mice, IgG antibody prevalence fluctuations were positively associated with population fluctuations. The rates of seroconversion, which in deer mice at both sites occurred mostly during late summer and midwinter, were higher than the seroprevalence, which suggests that the longer deer mice live, the greater the probability they will become infected with SNV.

"Hantaviruses are rodent-borne zoonotic agents that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Asia and Europe and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in North and South America. The epidemiology of human diseases caused by these viruses is tied to the ecology of the rodent hosts, and effective control and prevention relies on a through understanding of host ecology. After the 1993 HPS outbreak in the southwestern United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiated long-term studies of the temporal dynamics of hantavirus infection in host populations. These studies, which used mark-recapture techniques on 24 trapping webs at nine sites in the southwestern United States, were designed to monitor changes in reservoir population densities and in the prevalence and incidence of infection; quantify environmental factors associated with these changes; and when linked to surveillance databases for HPS, lead to predictive models of human risk to be used in the design and implementation of control and prevention measures for human hantavirus disease.

"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) was first recognized as a severe respiratory illness transmitted through rodent excreta in the southwestern United States in 1993. As of November 1997, 175 cases have been reported in the United States. The mortality rate of this disease has been reported to be as high as 52% in the United States, and the majority of the cases (94%) involved adults. Twenty-one cases have been recognized in Canada. This paper describes the first Canadian paediatric case and discusses some of the clinical features of this disease.

"Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus (Togaviridae: Alphavirus) was shown previously to have arisen by recombination between eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE)- and Sindbis-like viruses (C. S. Hahn, S. Lustig, E. G. Strauss, and J. H. Strauss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5997-6001, 1988). We have now examined the recombinational history and evolution of all viruses belonging to the WEE antigenic complex, including the Buggy Creek, Fort Morgan, Highlands J, Sindbis, Babanki, Ockelbo, Kyzylagach, Whataroa, and Aura viruses, using nucleotide sequences derived from representative strains. Two regions of the genome were examined: sequences of 477 nucleotides from the C terminus of the E1 envelope glycoprotein gene which in WEE virus was derived from the Sindbis-like virus parent, and 517 nucleotide sequences at the C terminus of the nsP4 gene which in WEE virus was derived from the EEE-like virus parent. Trees based on the E1 region indicated that all members of the WEE virus complex comprise a monophyletic group. Most closely related to WEE viruses are other New World members of the complex: the Highlands J, Buggy Creek, and Fort Morgan viruses. More distantly related WEE complex viruses included the Old World Sindbis, Babanki, Ockelbo, Kyzylagach, and Whataroa viruses, as well as the New World Aura virus. Detailed analyses of 38 strains of WEE virus revealed at least 4 major lineages; two were represented by isolates from Argentina, one was from Brazil, and a fourth contained isolates from many locations in South and North America as well as Cuba. Trees based on the nsP4 gene indicated that all New World WEE complex viruses except Aura virus are recombinants derived from EEE- and Sindbis-like virus ancestors. In contrast, the Old World members of the WEE complex, as well as Aura virus, did not appear to have recombinant genomes. Using an evolutionary rate estimate (2.8 x 10(-4) substitutions per nucleotide per year) obtained from E1-3' sequences of WEE viruses, we estimated that the recombination event occurred in the New World 1,300 to 1,900 years ago. This suggests that the alphaviruses originated in the New World a few thousand years ago.

"Three RNA polymerase activities were found and associated with purified Pichinde virus, a member of the Arenaviridae. A heat-labile polymerase activity which required all four ribonucleoside triphosphates for optimal activity co-sedimented on sucrose gradient centrifugation with the viral ribonucleoprotein complex from detergent-disrupted virus preparations. This enzyme synthesized heteropolymers which represented about 23% of the genome RNA as determined by nucleic acid hybridization. Two relatively heat-stable polymerase activities which differed in their cation requirement and substrate specificity were recovered with the virus-associated ribosomes. These polymerase activities synthesized homopolymers of limited chain length: in the presence of 10 mM Mg2%, polyuridylic acid was made, whereas in the presence of 1 mM Mn2%, polyadenylic acid was made. The addition of complementary RNA synthesized with the viral transcriptase in vitro to the reaction mixture containing the polyadenylic acid polymerase activity resulted in the terminal addition of polyadenylic acid to the complementary RNA. The possible function of the ribosome-associated polymerase activities in the replication of the virus is discussed.
"
"Antigens detected by the complement-fixation (CF) test were prepared from BHK-21 cells infected with Pichinde virus. The preparations contained two antigens demonstrable by immunodiffusion. The antigen present in abundance was heat stable, Pronase resistant, and had a molecular weight of 20,000 to 30,000 as estimated by gel filtration. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of purified antigen demonstrated two low-molecular-weight polypeptides. An identical antigenic determinant was found by disrupting purified virus with Nonidet P-40; however, none of the viral polypeptides co-migrated with the polypeptides derived from purified CF antigen. Pronase digestion of disrupted virus did not alter antigenicity but degraded the viral peptides to sizes similar to those associated with the major CF antigen. These observations suggest that the major CF antigen of Pichnide virus is a cleavage product of the structural proteins of the virus.

"Until now the serological typing of Yersinia pestis into subgroups has not proved possible because all the antigenic components are present in each isolate. Using acrylamide disk electrophoresis it was observed that differences exist in the protein distribution patterns of aqueous extracts from various Y. pestis isolates. One component that was especially plentiful in some Javanese and South American isolates was identified as the murine toxin. The amount of murine toxin varies significantly from isolate to isolate, and so permits them to be roughly grouped. In 28 degrees C cultures the variation in the murine toxin content is independent of the variation in the F-I content. A new method of typing based on this 2-trait variation in quantities, in contrast to classical typing based on qualitative differences, might prove to be a means of differentiating Y. pestis isolates.

"Pichinde virus, a member of the arenovirus group, was found to have four polypeptides by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Two components, V(I) and V(II), had molecular weights of about 72,000, whereas V(III) had a molecular weight of 34,000. A minor component, V(IV), had a molecular weight of about 12,000. Glucosamine was incorporated into V(II) and V(III), suggesting that these components were glycopeptides whereas V(I) and V(IV) were polypeptides. Treatment of the virus with Nonidet P-40 removed V(III), but V(I) and V(II) remained associated with the virus nucleic acid. This suggests a functional role of a ribonucleoprotein for V(I) and an envelope glycoprotein for V(III). V(II), the major glycopeptide, could function both as a membrane component and as a nucleoprotein.

"Indigenous South American rodents are abundant, varied, and adaptable, and occupy most of the available natural habitats. Knowledge of their taxonomy and biology is generally superficial. Near human habitations the introduced Rattus and Mus are common and their contacts with man are often close. Cities in South America are expanding to keep pace with increases in the human population and hitherto virgin land is being settled or cleared for food production. Thus domestic rodents are brought into contact with indigenous species and the inevitable exchange of parasites may then produce unpredictable threats to human health. The role of both wild and domestic rodents in the transmission of certain infectious diseases, such as plague, sylvatic Venezuelan encephalitis, South American haemorrhagic fevers, murine typhus, and cutaneous leishmaniasis, is well established. The involvement of rodents in some other diseases, such as leptospirosis, American trypanosomiasis, South American hydatid disease, and vesicular stomatitis, is less well understood. In certain other infections, including bartonellosis and the South American spotted fevers, a wild rodent reservoir is inferred but not yet identified.

"The Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC) coactivator Cdh1 drives proper cell cycle progression and is implicated in the suppression of tumorigenesis. However, it remains elusive how Cdh1 restrains cancer progression and how tumor cells escape the inhibition of Cdh1. Here we report that Cdh1 suppresses the kinase activity of c-Src in an APC-independent manner. Depleting Cdh1 accelerates breast cancer cell proliferation and cooperates with PTEN loss to promote breast tumor progression in mice. Hyperactive c-Src, on the other hand, reciprocally inhibits the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of APC(Cdh1) through direct phosphorylation of Cdh1 at its N-terminus, which disrupts the interaction between Cdh1 and the APC core complex. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of c-Src restores APC(Cdh1) tumor suppressor function to repress a panel of APC(Cdh1) oncogenic substrates. Our findings reveal a reciprocal feedback circuit of Cdh1 and c-Src in the crosstalk between the cell cycle machinery and the c-Src signaling pathway.

"Although respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is responsible for more human deaths each year than influenza, its pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood. Here high-resolution quantitative imaging, bioenergetics measurements and mitochondrial membrane potential- and redox-sensitive dyes are used to define RSV's impact on host mitochondria for the first time, delineating RSV-induced microtubule/dynein-dependent mitochondrial perinuclear clustering, and translocation towards the microtubule-organizing centre. These changes are concomitant with impaired mitochondrial respiration, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Strikingly, agents that target microtubule integrity the dynein motor protein, or inhibit mitochondrial ROS production strongly suppresses RSV virus production, including in a mouse model with concomitantly reduced virus-induced lung inflammation. The results establish RSV's unique ability to co-opt host cell mitochondria to facilitate viral infection, revealing the RSV-mitochondrial interface for the first time as a viable target for therapeutic intervention.

"The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) plays roles in both virus genome replication and assembly. NS5A comprises three domains, of these domain I is believed to be involved exclusively in genome replication. In contrast, domains II and III are required for the production of infectious virus particles and are largely dispensable for genome replication. Domain I is highly conserved between HCV and related hepaciviruses, and is highly structured, exhibiting different dimeric conformations. To investigate the functions of domain I in more detail, we conducted a mutagenic study of 12 absolutely conserved and surface-exposed residues within the context of a JFH-1-derived sub-genomic replicon and infectious virus. Whilst most of these abrogated genome replication, three mutants (P35A, V67A and P145A) retained the ability to replicate but showed defects in virus assembly. P35A exhibited a modest reduction in infectivity, however V67A and P145A produced no infectious virus. Using a combination of density gradient fractionation, biochemical analysis and high resolution confocal microscopy we demonstrate that V67A and P145A disrupted the localisation of NS5A to lipid droplets. In addition, the localisation and size of lipid droplets in cells infected with these two mutants were perturbed compared to wildtype HCV. Biophysical analysis revealed that V67A and P145A abrogated the ability of purified domain I to dimerize and resulted in an increased affinity of binding to HCV 3'UTR RNA. Taken together, we propose that domain I of NS5A plays multiple roles in assembly, binding nascent genomic RNA and transporting it to lipid droplets where it is transferred to Core. Domain I also contributes to a change in lipid droplet morphology, increasing their size. This study reveals novel functions of NS5A domain I in assembly of infectious HCV and provides new perspectives on the virus lifecycle.

"BACKGROUND: Targeting the expression of genes has emerged as a potentially viable therapeutic approach to human disease. In Alzheimer's disease, therapies that silence the expression of tau could be a viable strategy to slow disease progression. METHODS: We produced a novel strain of transgenic mice that could be used to assess the efficacy of gene knockdown therapies for human tau, in live mice. We designed a tetracycline-regulated transgene construct in which the cDNA for human tau was fused to ubiquitin and to luciferase to create a single fusion polyprotein, termed TUL. RESULTS: When expressed in brain, the TUL polyprotein was cleaved by ubiquitin-processing enzymes to release the luciferase as an independent protein, separating the half-life of luciferase from the long-lived tau protein. Treatment of bigenic tTA/TUL mice with doxycycline produced rapid declines in luciferase levels visualized by in vivo imaging and ex vivo enzyme measurement. CONCLUSIONS: This new mouse model can be used as a discovery tool in optimizing gene targeting therapeutics directed to reduce human tau mRNA levels.

"Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections occur in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts and are an increasingly recognized cause of morbidity and mortality. The hallmark of pulmonary mycobacterial infections is the formation of granuloma in the lung. Our study focuses on the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cytoprotective enzyme, in the regulation of granuloma development and maturation following infection with Mycobacterium avium. We examined the role of HO-1 in regulating monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), two molecules involved in monocyte-macrophage cell trafficking after infection. We showed that RAW 264.7 mouse monocytes exposed to M. avium expressed HO-1 and MCP-1. Inhibition of HO by zinc protoporphyrin-IX led to inhibition of MCP-1 and increased expression of CCR2, its cognate receptor. HO-1⁻/⁻ mice did not develop organized granuloma in their lungs, had higher lung colony forming unit of M. avium when infected with intratracheal M. avium, and had loose collections of inflammatory cells in the lung parenchyma. Mycobacteria were found only inside defined granulomas but not outside granuloma in the lungs of HO-1⁺/⁺ mice. In HO-1⁻/⁻ mice, mycobacteria were also found in the liver and spleen and showed increased mortality. Peripheral blood monocytes isolated from GFP⁺ mice and given intravenously to HO-1⁺/⁺ mice localized into tight granulomas, while in HO-1⁻/⁻ mice they remained diffusely scattered in areas of parenchymal inflammation. Higher MCP-1 levels were found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of M. avium infected HO-1(-/-) mice and CCR2 expression was higher in HO-1⁻/⁻ alveolar macrophages when compared with HO-1⁺/⁺ mice. CCR2 expression localized to granuloma in HO-1⁺/⁺ mice but not in the HO-1⁻/⁻ mice. These findings strongly suggest that HO-1 plays a protective role in the control of M. avium infection.

"Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an atypical aspartic protease that hydrolyzes peptide bonds within the transmembrane domain of substrates and is implicated in several biological and pathological functions. Here, we analyzed the structure of human SPP by electron microscopy and reconstructed the three-dimensional structure at a resolution of 22 Å. Enzymatically active SPP forms a slender, bullet-shaped homotetramer with dimensions of 85 × 85 × 130 Å. The SPP complex has four concaves on the rhombus-like sides, connected to a large chamber inside the molecule. Intriguingly, the N-terminal region of SPP is sufficient for the tetrameric assembly. Moreover, overexpression of the N-terminal region inhibited the formation of the endogenous SPP tetramer and the proteolytic activity within cells. These data suggest that the homotetramer is the functional unit of SPP and that its N-terminal region, which works as the structural scaffold, has a novel modulatory function for the intramembrane-cleaving activity of SPP.

"Cells react to viral infection by exhibiting IFN-based innate immune responses and integrated stress responses, but little is known about the interrelationships between the two. In this study, we report a linkage between these two host-protective cellular mechanisms. We found that IFN regulatory factor (IRF)7, the master regulator of type I IFN gene expression, interacts with activating transcription factor (ATF)4, a key component of the integrated stress responses whose translation is induced by viral infection and various stresses. We have demonstrated that IRF7 upregulates ATF4 activity and expression, whereas ATF4 in return inhibits IRF7 activation, suggesting a cross-regulation between the IFN response and the cellular integrated stress response that controls host innate immune defense against viral infection.

"Cholera and malaria are major diseases causing high mortality. The only licensed cholera vaccine is expensive; immunity is lost in children within 3 years and adults are not fully protected. No vaccine is yet available for malaria. Therefore, in this study, the cholera toxin-B subunit (CTB) of Vibrio cholerae fused to malarial vaccine antigens apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA1) and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP1) was expressed in lettuce and tobacco chloroplasts. Southern blot analysis confirmed homoplasmy and stable integration of transgenes. CTB-AMA1 and CTB-MSP1 fusion proteins accumulated up to 13.17% and 10.11% (total soluble protein, TSP) in tobacco and up to 7.3% and 6.1% (TSP) in lettuce, respectively. Nine groups of mice (n = 10/group) were immunized subcutaneously (SQV) or orally (ORV) with purified antigens or transplastomic tobacco leaves. Significant levels of antigen-specific antibody titres of immunized mice completely inhibited proliferation of the malarial parasite and cross-reacted with the native parasite proteins in immunoblots and immunofluorescence studies. Protection against cholera toxin challenge in both ORV (100%) and SQV (89%) mice correlated with CTB-specific titres of intestinal, serum IgA and IgG1 in ORV and only IgG1 in SQV mice, but no other immunoglobulin. Increasing numbers of interleukin-10(+) T cell but not Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, suppression of interferon-gamma and absence of interleukin-17 were observed in protected mice, suggesting that immunity is conferred via the Tr1/Th2 immune response. Dual immunity against two major infectious diseases provided by chloroplast-derived vaccine antigens for long-term (>300 days, 50% of mouse life span) offers a realistic platform for low cost vaccines and insight into mucosal and systemic immunity.

"Postgonadectomy adrenocortical tumorigenesis is a strain-specific phenomenon in inbred mice, assumed to be caused by elevated LH secretion and subsequent ectopic LH receptor (LHR) overexpression in adrenal gland. However, the molecular mechanisms of this cascade of events remain unknown. In this study, we took advantage of the mouse strain dependency of the phenotype to unravel its genetic basis. Our results present the first genome-wide screening related to this pathology in two independent F2 and backcross populations generated between the neoplastic DBA/2J and the nonsusceptible C57BL/6J strains. Surprisingly, the postgonadectomy elevation of serum LH was followed by similar up-regulation of adrenal LHR expression in both parental strains and their crosses, irrespective of their tumor status, indicating that it is not the immediate cause of the tumorigenesis. Linkage analysis revealed one major significant locus for the tumorigenesis on chromosome 8, modulated by epistasis with another quantitative trait locus on chromosome 18. Weight gain, a secondary phenotype after gonadectomy, showed a significant but separate quantitative trait locus on chromosome 7. Altogether, postgonadectomy adrenocortical tumorigenesis in DBA/2J mice is a dominant trait that is not a direct consequence of adrenal LHR expression but is driven by a complex genetic architecture. Analysis of candidate genes in the tumorigenesis linkage region showed that Sfrp1 (secreted frizzled-related protein 1), a tumor suppressor gene, is differentially expressed in the neoplastic areas. These findings may have relevance to the human pathogenesis of macronodular adrenal hyperplasia and adrenocortical tumors in postmenopausal women and why some of them develop obesity.

"Arthropods pests are most frequently associated with both plants and vertebrate animals. Ticks, in particular the blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis Say and Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae), are associated with wildlife hosts and are the primary vectors of Lyme disease, the most frequently reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Immature blacklegged ticks in the eastern United States frequently use small mammals from the genus Peromyscus as hosts. These mice are competent reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, as well as other tick-borne pathogens. To conduct surveillance on immature ticks and pathogen circulation in hosts, capture and handling of these small mammals is required. While protocols for rearing and pest surveillance on plants are common, there are very few protocols aimed at entomologists to conduct research on vertebrate-arthropod relationships. The goal of this manuscript is to provide a practical template for trapping Peromyscus spp. for vector and vector-borne pathogen surveillance and ecology for professionals that may not have a background in wildlife research. Important considerations are highlighted when targeting P. leucopus Rafinesque and P. maniculatus Wagner. Specifically, for tick and tick-borne disease-related projects, materials that may be required are suggested and references and other resources for researchers beginning a trapping study are provided.

"BACKGROUND: Field margin and non-crop vegetation in agricultural systems are potential ecosystem services providers because they offer semi-natural habitats for both below and above ground animal groups such as soil organisms, small mammals, birds and arthropods that are service supplying units. They are considered as a target area for enhancing farm biodiversity. METHODOLOGY: To explore the multiple potential benefits of these semi-natural habitats and to identify research trends and knowledge gaps globally, a review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A total of 235 publications from the year 2000 to 2016 in the Scopus and Web of Science databases were reviewed. RESULTS: The literature showed an increasing trend in the number of published articles over time with European studies leading in the proportion of studies conducted, followed by North America, Asia, South America, Africa and Australia. Several functional groups of organisms were studied from field margin and non-crop vegetation around agricultural lands including natural enemies (37%), insect pests (22%), birds (17%), pollinators (16%), soil macro fauna (4%) and small mammals (4%). Ecosystem services derived from the field margin included natural pest regulation, pollination, nutrient cycling and reduced offsite erosion. Some field margin plants were reported to host detrimental crop pests, a major ecosystem dis-service, potentially leading to increased pest infestation in the field. CONCLUSION: The majority of studies revealed the importance of field margin and non-crop vegetation around arable fields in enhancing ecosystem biodiversity. Promotion of field margin plants that selectively enhance the population of beneficial organisms would support sustainable food security rather than simply boosting plant diversity. Our analyses also highlight that agro-ecological studies remain largely overlooked in some regions.

"In this study, we examined the prevalence, pathology, and epidemiology of tumors in free-ranging island foxes occurring on three islands in the California Channel Islands, USA. We found a remarkably high prevalence of ceruminous gland tumors in endangered foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) occurring on Santa Catalina Island (SCA)--48.9% of the dead foxes examined from 2001-2008 had tumors in their ears, and tumors were found in 52.2% of randomly-selected mature (≥ 4 years) foxes captured in 2007-2008, representing one of the highest prevalences of tumors ever documented in a wildlife population. In contrast, no tumors were detected in foxes from San Nicolas Island or San Clemente Island, although ear mites (Otodectes cynotis), a predisposing factor for ceruminous gland tumors in dogs and cats, were highly prevalent on all three islands. On SCA, otitis externa secondary to ear mite infection was highly correlated with ceruminous gland hyperplasia (CGH), and tumors were significantly associated with the severity of CGH, ceruminous gland dysplasia, and age group (older foxes). We propose a conceptual model for the formation of ceruminous gland tumors in foxes on SCA that is based on persistent, ubiquitous infection with ear mites, and an innate, over exuberant inflammatory and hyperplastic response of SCA foxes to these mites. Foxes on SCA are now opportunistically treated with acaricides in an attempt to reduce mite infections and the morbidity and mortality associated with this highly prevalent tumor.

"To determine the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi in British Columbian ticks, fieldwork was conducted over a 2-year period. In all, 893 ticks (Ixodes pacificus, I. angustus, I. soricis, Ixodes spp., and Dermacentor andersoni) of different life stages were retrieved from 483 small rodents (Peromyscus maniculatus, Perognathus parvus, and Reithrodontomys megalotis). B. burgdorferi DNA was detected in 5 out of 359 tick pools, and 41 out of 483 mice were serologically confirmed to have antibodies against B. burgdorferi. These results were consistent with previous studies, data from passive surveillance in British Columbia, and data from neighboring states in the Pacific Northwest, suggesting a continually low prevalence of B. burgdorferi in British Columbia ticks.

"Human risks of acquiring a zoonotic disease from animals used in biomedical research have declined over the last decade because higher quality research animals have defined microbiologic profiles. Even with diminished risks, the potential for exposure to infectious agents still exists, especially from larger species such as nonhuman primates, which may be obtained from the wild, and from livestock, dogs, ferrets, and cats, which are generally not raised in barrier facilities and are not subject to the intensive health monitoring performed routinely on laboratory rodents and rabbits. Additionally, when laboratory animals are used as models for infectious disease studies, exposure to microbial pathogens presents a threat to human health. Also, with the recognition of emerging diseases, some of which are zoonotic, constant vigilance and surveillance of laboratory animals for zoonotic diseases are still required.

"BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of evidence that B chromosomes, once regarded as totally heterochromatic and genetically inert, harbor multiple segmental duplications containing clusters of ribosomal RNA genes, processed pseudogenes and protein-coding genes. Application of novel molecular approaches further supports complex composition and possible phenotypic effects of B chromosomes. RESULTS: Here we review recent findings of gene-carrying genomic segments on B chromosomes from different vertebrate groups. We demonstrate that the genetic content of B chromosomes is highly heterogeneous and some B chromosomes contain multiple large duplications derived from various chromosomes of the standard karyotype. Although B chromosomes seem to be mostly homologous to each other within a species, their genetic content differs between species. There are indications that some genomic regions are more likely to be located on B chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of multiple autosomal genes on B chromosomes opens a new discussion about their possible effects ranging from sex determination to fitness and adaptation, their complex interactions with host genome and role in evolution.

"Mammalian genomes comprise many active and fossilized retroelements. The obligate requirement for retroelement integration affords host genomes an opportunity to 'domesticate' retroelement genes for their own purpose, leading to important innovations in genome defense and placentation. While many such exaptations involve retroviruses, the L1TD1 gene is the only known domesticated gene whose protein-coding sequence is almost entirely derived from a LINE-1 (L1) retroelement. Human L1TD1 has been shown to play an important role in pluripotency maintenance. To investigate how this role was acquired, we traced the origin and evolution of L1TD1. We find that L1TD1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. We also find that L1TD1 has evolved under positive selection during primate and mouse evolution, and that one prosimian L1TD1 has 'replenished' itself with a more recent L1 ORF1 from the prosimian genome. These data suggest that L1TD1 has been recurrently selected for functional novelty, perhaps for a role in genome defense. L1TD1 loss is associated with L1 extinction in several megabat lineages, but not in sigmodontine rodents. We hypothesize that L1TD1 could have originally evolved for genome defense against L1 elements. Later, L1TD1 may have become incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. Our study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology, and that such domesticated genes can adopt different functions in different lineages.

"Decay accelerating factor (DAF/CD55) is targeted by many pathogens for cell entry. It has been implicated as a co-receptor for hantaviruses. To examine the binding of hantaviruses to DAF, we describe the use of Protein G beads for binding human IgG Fc domain-functionalized DAF ((DAF)₂-Fc). When mixed with Protein G beads the resulting DAF beads can be used as a generalizable platform for measuring kinetic and equilibrium binding constants of DAF binding targets. The hantavirus interaction has high affinity (24-30 nM; k(on) ~ 10⁵ M⁻¹ s⁻¹, k(off) ~ 0.0045 s⁻¹). The bivalent (DAF)₂-Fc/SNV data agree with hantavirus binding to DAF expressed on Tanoue B cells (K(d) = 14.0 nM). Monovalent affinity interaction between SNV and recombinant DAF of 58.0 nM is determined from competition binding. This study serves a dual purpose of presenting a convenient and quantitative approach of measuring binding affinities between DAF and the many cognate viral and bacterial ligands and providing new data on the binding constant of DAF and Sin Nombre hantavirus. Knowledge of the equilibrium binding constant allows for the determination of the relative fractions of bound and free virus particles in cell entry assays. This is important for drug discovery assays for cell entry inhibitors.

"BACKGROUND: Most eukaryotic species represent stable karyotypes with a particular diploid number. B chromosomes are additional to standard karyotypes and may vary in size, number and morphology even between cells of the same individual. For many years it was generally believed that B chromosomes found in some plant, animal and fungi species lacked active genes. Recently, molecular cytogenetic studies showed the presence of additional copies of protein-coding genes on B chromosomes. However, the transcriptional activity of these genes remained elusive. We studied karyotypes of the Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) that possess up to 14 B chromosomes to investigate the presence and expression of genes on supernumerary chromosomes. RESULTS: Here, we describe a 2 Mbp region homologous to cattle chromosome 3 and containing TNNI3K (partial), FPGT, LRRIQ3 and a large gene-sparse segment on B chromosomes of the Siberian roe deer. The presence of the copy of the autosomal region was demonstrated by B-specific cDNA analysis, PCR assisted mapping, cattle bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone localization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). By comparative analysis of B-specific and non-B chromosomal sequences we discovered some B chromosome-specific mutations in protein-coding genes, which further enabled the detection of a FPGT-TNNI3K transcript expressed from duplicated genes located on B chromosomes in roe deer fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Discovery of a large autosomal segment in all B chromosomes of the Siberian roe deer further corroborates the view of an autosomal origin for these elements. Detection of a B-derived transcript in fibroblasts implies that the protein coding sequences located on Bs are not fully inactivated. The origin, evolution and effect on host of B chromosomal genes seem to be similar to autosomal segmental duplications, which reinforces the view that supernumerary chromosomal elements might play an important role in genome evolution.

"To gain more insight into the phylogeny of Dabieshan virus (DBSV), carried by Niviventer confucianus and other Murinae-associated hantaviruses, genome sequences of novel variants of DBSV were recovered from Niviventer rats trapped in the mountainous areas of Wenzhou, China. Genetic analyses show that all known genetic variants of DBSV, including the ones identified in this study, are distinct from other Murinae-associated hantaviruses. DBSV variants show geographic clustering and high intraspecies diversity. The data suggest that DBSV is a distinct species in the genus Hantavirus. Interestingly, DBSV shows the highest sequence identity to Hantaan virus (HTNV), with a >7% difference in the sequences of the N, GPC, and L proteins, while N. confucianus is more closely related to Rattus norvegicus (the host of Seoul virus [SEOV]) than to Apodemus agrarius (the host of HTNV and Saaremaa virus [SAAV]). Further genetic analyses of all known Murinae-associated hantaviruses (both established and tentative species) show that many of them, including DBSV, may have originated from host switching. The estimation of evolutionary rates and divergence time supports the role of cross-species transmission in the evolution of Murinae-associated hantaviruses. The detection of positive selection suggests that genetic drift may contribute to the speciation of Murinae-associated hantaviruses and that adaptation has a role as well.

"Hantaviruses cause two severe diseases in humans: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). The lack of vaccines or specific drugs to prevent or treat HFRS and HCPS and the requirement for conducting experiments in a biosafety level 3 laboratory (BSL-3) limit the ability to probe the mechanism of infection and disease pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a generalizable spectroscopic assay to quantify saturable fluorophore sites solubilized in envelope membranes of Sin Nombre virus (SNV) particles. We then used flow cytometry and live cell confocal fluorescence microscopy imaging to show that ultraviolet (UV)-killed SNV particles bind to the cognate receptors of live virions, namely, decay accelerating factor (DAF/CD55) expressed on Tanoue B cells and alpha(v)beta(3) integrins expressed on Vero E6 cells. SNV binding to DAF is multivalent and of high affinity (K(d) approximately 26pM). Self-exchange competition binding assays between fluorescently labeled SNV and unlabeled SNV are used to evaluate an infectious unit-to-particle ratio of approximately 1:14,000. We configured the assay for measuring the binding of fluorescently labeled SNV to Tanoue B suspension cells using a high-throughput flow cytometer. In this way, we established a proof-of-principle high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for binding inhibition. This is a first step toward developing HTS format assays for small molecule inhibitors of viral-cell interactions as well as dissecting the mechanism of infection in a BSL-2 environment.

"Trade-offs exist among life history strategies that are used to increase survival and reproduction; such that, males that engage in more competitive behaviors may be more susceptible to infection. Hantaviruses are transmitted horizontally between rodents through the passage of virus in saliva during wounding and male rodents are more likely to be infected with hantaviruses than females. To determine whether a trade-off exists between dominance and susceptibility to Seoul virus infection, male Long Evans rats were group housed (3/cage) with a female rat and aggressive and subordinate behaviors were monitored during a 10 day group housing condition. After behavioral testing, males were individually housed, inoculated with Seoul virus, and blood, saliva, and fecal samples were collected. Dominant males initiated more aggressive encounters than subordinate males. Dominant and subordinate males, however, had similar steroid hormone concentrations, anti-Seoul virus IgG responses, and weight gain over the course of infection. A similar proportion of dominant and subordinate males shed virus in saliva and feces during infection. Using microsatellite DNA markers paternity was assigned to pups derived during the group housing period. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, dominant and subordinate males sired a similar percentage of pups. Taken together, host social status may not predict reproductive success or susceptibility to hantaviruses in rodent reservoir populations.

"Diagnostic and epidemiologic virology laboratories have in large part traded conventional techniques of virus detection and identification for more rapid, novel, and sensitive molecular methods. By doing so, useful phenotypic characteristics are not being determined. We feel that the impact of this shift in emphasis has impaired studies of the biology of viruses. This position paper is a plea to the scientific and administrative communities to reconsider the importance of such information. We also suggest a revised paradigm for virus isolation and characterization and provide a rationale for accumulating biologic (phenotypic) information.

"Comprehensive analysis of neuronal networks requires brain-wide measurement of connectivity, activity, and gene expression. Although high-throughput methods are available for mapping brain-wide activity and transcriptomes, comparable methods for mapping region-to-region connectivity remain slow and expensive because they require averaging across hundreds of brains. Here we describe BRICseq (brain-wide individual animal connectome sequencing), which leverages DNA barcoding and sequencing to map connectivity from single individuals in a few weeks and at low cost. Applying BRICseq to the mouse neocortex, we find that region-to-region connectivity provides a simple bridge relating transcriptome to activity: the spatial expression patterns of a few genes predict region-to-region connectivity, and connectivity predicts activity correlations. We also exploited BRICseq to map the mutant BTBR mouse brain, which lacks a corpus callosum, and recapitulated its known connectopathies. BRICseq allows individual laboratories to compare how age, sex, environment, genetics, and species affect neuronal wiring and to integrate these with functional activity and gene expression.

"Vocalization is an ancient vertebrate trait essential to many forms of communication, ranging from courtship calls to free verse. Vocalizations may be entirely innate and evoked by sexual cues or emotional state, as with many types of calls made in primates, rodents and birds; volitional, as with innate calls that, following extensive training, can be evoked by arbitrary sensory cues in non-human primates and corvid songbirds; or learned, acoustically flexible and complex, as with human speech and the courtship songs of oscine songbirds. This review compares and contrasts the neural mechanisms underlying innate, volitional and learned vocalizations, with an emphasis on functional studies in primates, rodents and songbirds. This comparison reveals both highly conserved and convergent mechanisms of vocal production in these different groups, despite their often vast phylogenetic separation. This similarity of central mechanisms for different forms of vocal production presents experimentalists with useful avenues for gaining detailed mechanistic insight into how vocalizations are employed for social and sexual signalling, and how they can be modified through experience to yield new vocal repertoires customized to the individual's social group. This article is part of the theme issue 'What can animal communication teach us about human language?'
"
"The study of human language is progressively moving toward comparative and interactive frameworks, extending the concept of turn-taking to animal communication. While such an endeavor will help us understand the interactive origins of language, any theoretical account for cross-species turn-taking should consider three key points. First, animal turn-taking must incorporate biological studies on animal chorusing, namely how different species coordinate their signals over time. Second, while concepts employed in human communication and turn-taking, such as intentionality, are still debated in animal behavior, lower level mechanisms with clear neurobiological bases can explain much of animal interactive behavior. Third, social behavior, interactivity, and cooperation can be orthogonal, and the alternation of animal signals need not be cooperative. Considering turn-taking a subset of chorusing in the rhythmic dimension may avoid overinterpretation and enhance the comparability of future empirical work.

"Neural vasopressin is a potent modulator of behaviour in vertebrates. It acts at both sensory processing regions and within larger regulatory networks to mediate changes in social recognition, affiliation, aggression, communication and other social behaviours. There are multiple populations of vasopressin neurons within the brain, including groups in olfactory and visual processing regions. Some of these vasopressin neurons, such as those in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs, anterior olfactory nucleus, piriform cortex and retina, were recently identified using an enhanced green fluorescent protein-vasopressin (eGFP-VP) transgenic rat. Based on the interconnectivity of vasopressin-producing and sensitive brain areas and in consideration of autocrine, paracrine and neurohormone-like actions associated with somato-dendritic release, we discuss how these different neuronal populations may interact to impact behaviour.

"Social behavior is among the most complex and variable of traits. Despite its diversity, we know little about how genetic and developmental factors interact to shape natural variation in social behavior. This review surveys recent work on individual differences in the expression of the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR), a major regulator of social behavior, in the neocortex of the socially monogamous prairie vole. V1aR exhibits profound variation in the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), a region critical to spatial and contextual memory. RSC-V1aR abundance is associated with patterns of male space-use and sexual fidelity in the field: males with high RSC-V1aR show high spatial and sexual fidelity to partners, while low RSC-V1aR males are significantly more likely to mate outside the pair-bond. Individual differences in RSC-V1aR are predicted by a set of linked single nucleotide polymorphisms within the avpr1a locus. These alternative alleles have been actively maintained by selection, suggesting that the brain differences represent a balanced polymorphism. Lastly, the alleles occur within regulatory sequences, and result in differential sensitivity to environmental perturbation. Together the data provide insight into how genetic, epigenetic and evolutionary forces interact to shape the social brain.

"As mammals develop, they encounter increasing social complexity in the surrounding world. In order to survive, mammals must show appropriate behaviors toward their mates, offspring, and same-sex conspecifics. Although the behavioral effects of the neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) have been studied in a variety of social contexts, the effects of this neuropeptide on multimodal sensory processing have received less attention. AVP is widely distributed through sensory regions of the brain and has been demonstrated to modulate olfactory, auditory, gustatory, and visual processing. Here, we review the evidence linking AVP to the processing of social stimuli in sensory regions of the brain and explore how sensory processing can shape behavioral responses to these stimuli. In addition, we address the interplay between hormonal and neural AVP in regulating sensory processing of social cues. Because AVP pathways show plasticity during development, early life experiences may shape life-long processing of sensory information. Furthermore, disorders of social behavior such as autism and schizophrenia that have been linked with AVP also have been linked with dysfunctions in sensory processing. Together, these studies suggest that AVP's diversity of effects on social behavior across a variety of mammalian species may result from the effects of this neuropeptide on sensory processing.

"In recent decades, scientific understanding of the many roles of oxytocin (OT) in social behavior has advanced tremendously. The focus of this research has been on maternal attachments and reproductive pair-bonds, and much less is known about the substrates of sociality outside of reproductive contexts. It is now apparent that OT influences many aspects of social behavior including recognition, trust, empathy, and other components of the behavioral repertoire of social species. This review provides a comparative perspective on the contributions of OT to life in mammalian social groups. We provide background on the functions of OT in maternal attachments and the early social environment, and give an overview of the role of OT circuitry in support of different mating systems. We then introduce peer relationships in group-living rodents as a means for studying the importance of OT in non-reproductive affiliative behaviors. We review species differences in oxytocin receptor (OTR) distributions in solitary and group-living species of South American tuco-tucos and in African mole-rats, as well as singing mice. We discuss variation in OTR levels with seasonal changes in social behavior in female meadow voles, and the effects of OT manipulations on peer huddling behavior. Finally, we discuss avenues of promise for future investigation, and relate current findings to research in humans and non-human primates. There is growing evidence that OT is involved in social selectivity, including increases in aggression toward social outgroups and decreased huddling with unfamiliar individuals, which may support existing social structures or relationships at the expense of others. OT's effects reach beyond maternal attachment and pair bonds to play a role in affiliative behavior underlying ""friendships"", organization of broad social structures, and maintenance of established social relationships with individuals or groups.
"
"Genetic monogamy is rare-at least at the level of a species-and monogamy can exist in the absence of sexual fidelity. Rather than focusing on mating exclusivity, it has become common to use the term ""social monogamy"" to describe a cluster of social features, including the capacity for selective and lasting social bonds, central to what humans call ""love."" Socially monogamous mammals often exhibit selective aggression toward strangers and form extended families. These features of social monogamy in mammals are supported by patterns of hormonal function originating in the neurobiology of maternity, including oxytocin, as well as a more primitive vasopressin pathway. Another key feature of social monogamy is reduced sexual dimorphism. Processes associated with sexual differentiation offer clues to the mysteries surrounding the evolution of monogamy. Although there is consistency in the necessary ingredients, it is likely that there is no single recipe for social monogamy. As reviewed here, genes for steroids and peptides and their receptors are variable and are subject to epigenetic regulation across the lifespan permitting individual, gender and species variations and providing substrates for evolution. Reduced sensitivity to gonadal androgens, and a concurrent increased reliance on vasopressin (for selective defense) and oxytocin (for selective affiliation) may have offered pathways to the emergence of social monogamy.

"Patterns of animal activity provide important insight into hypotheses in animal behavior, physiological ecology, behavioral ecology, as well as population and community ecology. Understanding patterns of animal activity in field settings is often complicated by the need for expensive equipment and time-intensive methods that limit data collection. Because animals must be active to be detected, the timing of detection (e.g., the timing of capture) may be a useful proxy for estimation of activity time. In this paper, we describe a new method for determining timing of capture for small mammals. In our method, two small temperature loggers are positioned in each trap so that one logger registers the internal temperature of a live-trap at set intervals while the other logger simultaneously records external trap temperature. We illustrate the utility of this technique using field data from live-trapping of deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, one of the most ubiquitous, widely distributed small mammals in North America. Traps with animals inside registered consistent increases in internal trap temperature, creating a clear, characteristic temperature deviation between the two data loggers that can determine trap entry time within a very narrow time window (e.g., 10 minutes). We also present pilot data to demonstrate the usefulness of the method for two other small-mammal species. This new method is relatively inexpensive, robust to field conditions, and does not require modification of traps or wiring of new devices. It can be deployed as part of common live-trapping methods, making it possible to assay the timing of capture for a large number of animals in many different ecological contexts. In addition to quantifying timing of capture, this approach may also collect meaningful temperature data and provide insight into the thermal costs of animal activity and relationships between environmental conditions and the time of an animal's capture.

"Of the four species of the genus Echinococcus (Cestoda) distinguished by biological and morphological characteristics, two species, E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus, occur widely in the Neotropics. Approximately 200 cases of polycystic echinococcosis (PE) have been recorded from 12 countries in South America. Following early proliferation of E. vogeli in the human host, typically in the liver, the metacestode usually spreads in the peritoneal and pleural cavities, and numerous organs may be invaded. The clinical characteristics of PE in 81 patients with sufficient information are reviewed. Type I disease consists of polycysts in the liver and abdominal cavity (37% of the patients had this characteristic); type II is similar to type I but also includes hepatic insufficiency (26%); type III consists of cysts in liver and chest (14%); type IV consists of cysts only in the mesenteries (16%); and type V consists of cysts calcified in liver and lung (4%). The percentage of patients with polycysts in the liver was 81%, and the percentage of patients with polycysts in the chest was 14%. PE is most ready diagnosed by geographic origin of the patient and by means of ultrasound or computerized tomography scanning showing cysts and calcifications. The highest mortality was for patients with type II disease, due to hepatic failure and its complications. There were five patients who died due to surgical accidents, whereas 35 cases had uncomplicated surgery. Twenty-three patients died of PE, making the total mortality 29% (23 of 78 cases). None of the 13 patients treated only with albendazole, the most efficacious treatment, was completely cured. PE represents a severe medical problem in South America. A reevaluation of the characteristics of the metacestode of E. oligarthrus indicated that it is unicystic. Only three human cases are known (two with infection in the orbit and one with infection in the heart). The metacestode of E. oligarthrus, in contrast with that of E. vogeli, consists of a spherical, fluid-filled vesicle that enlarges concentrically and is not known to undergo exogenous proliferation.

"Causative disease and stress agents which manifest as dermatitis in mammals have varying effects on individual animals, from benign irritation and inflammation, to causing morbidity and even mortality. Bacteria, viruses and ectoparasites are all potential causes of dermatitis, and it can be exacerbated by various environmental, genetic and social factors. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether dermatitis is more likely to manifest in already-vulnerable wildlife species. Here, we systematically review the literature for reports of dermatitis in terrestrial and semi-aquatic wild mammalian species, with the goal of determining the biogeographical scale of dermatitis reports, the causes of dermatitis, and whether manifestation of dermatitis is reported more commonly in certain wildlife species or their captivity status (i.e., free-living, in captivity or in a laboratory). We reveal biases in the reporting of dermatitis by a biogeographic realm, with 55% of cases reported in the Nearctic, and towards particular orders of mammals, namely Artiodactyla and Carnivora. Overall, free-living wildlife is almost twice as likely to be reported as having dermatitis than individuals in captivity and six times more likely than individuals in laboratories, which we interpret as owing to exposure to a broader spectrum of parasites in free-ranging individuals, and potential reporting bias in captive individuals. Notably, dermatitis was reported in 23 threatened species, with some species more likely than others to be reported exhibiting clinical signs of dermatitis resulting from underlying health problems. We also find that threatened species are more likely to be reported as having dermatitis in captivity, particularly outside of their endemic home range. This review highlights diverse patterns of dermatological disease causes in captive and free-ranging wildlife, conditions under which they are more likely to be documented, and the need for cross-disciplinary research to ascertain (and so better manage) the varied causes.

"Among the principal causes producing detrimental effects on global biodiversity are introductions of alien species. Very few attempts to control introduced amphibians and reptiles in Middle America (Mexico and Central America) can be identified, so listings are provided for 24 exotic species, 16 translocated species, and 11 species that were removed from the introduced species listing because of lack of substantiating evidence that they are from established populations. Biosecurity methods are also identified that can be applied for preventing, controlling, and managing introduced and especially invasive species.

"Fleas are hematophagous insects infesting mainly small mammals and, less frequently, birds. With their wide range of potential hosts, fleas play a significant role in the circulation of pathogens in nature. Depending on the species, they can be vectors for viruses, bacteria, rickettsiae, and protozoa and a host for some larval forms of tapeworm species. The aim of this study was to determine the species composition of fleas and their small rodent host preferences in eastern Poland. Animals were captured in traps in various types of ecological habitats (a site covered by grassland vegetation within city limits, an unused agricultural meadow, and a fallow land near a mixed forest). The following rodent species were caught: Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Microtus arvalis, and Myodesglareolus. Additionally, Ctenophthalmus agyrtes, Ctenophthalmus assimilis, Hystrichopsylla talpae, and Nosopsyllus fasciatus flea species were identified. The peak of the flea activity was noted in summer months. C. agyrtes was found to be the most abundant flea species in eastern Poland, while the greatest numbers of fleas were collected from the rodent species A. agrarius.

"BACKGROUND/AIM: To optimize the expansion of human dental pulp cells in vitro by exploring several cryopreservation methodologies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The intra-dental pulp tissues from healthy subjects were extracted and divided into three separate tissue segments, which were randomly divided into the three following groups; the fresh group, the 5% DMSO group, and the 10% DMSO group. In the fresh group, dental pulp cells were directly cultivated as primary cultures, whereas in the DMSO groups, the dental pulp cells were cultivated from cryopreserved pulp tissue segments one month later. RESULTS: The cell yield and the time it took for the cells to grow out of the pulp tissue and attach to the culture plate varied among the three groups; the 5% DMSO group was inferior to the fresh group but superior to the 10% DMSO group (p<0.05). Moreover, no differences were found at the 1st passage amongst the three groups regarding the following aspects (p>0.05); colony formation rate and cell survival rate. Furthermore, no differences were noted at the 3(rd) passage regarding the following aspects (p>0.05); proliferation ability, cell growth curve and surface marker expression of dental pulp cells. CONCLUSION: Five percent DMSO may be the most optimal condition for tissue storage to preserve stem cells in situ.

"Wild boar are considered one the world's worst invasive species and linked to biodiversity loss, competition for resources, predation of native species, and habitat modifications. In this study, we use camera traps to evaluate whether the invasive wild boar had an effect on the medium-sized mammal community of a protected area in southern Brazil. Based on photographic records, we evaluated whether the presence and relative abundance of wild boar was associated with a decrease in diversity or change in activity of medium-sized mammals. All comparisons were made between samples where wild boar were present or absent. The records of each camera during a season were considered a sample. The wild boar was the fourth most common species in the study area being present in 7.8% of the photographic records. The species richness of mammals was not negatively affected by the occurrence of wild boar and most common species did not exhibit changes in the daily activity pattern. However, we recorded an increase in the time elapsed between an observation of wild boar and the record of the next species relative to the average latency period observed among other mammalian species. This average latency period was similar to that observed in the case of large predators such as Puma, and its increase could be reflective partly of the avoidance of native species to wild boar. Nevertheless, our results show that the effect of invasive wild boar on the mammal community is not large as expected.

"Vertebral heart scoring (VHS) is a semiquantitative method to assess the presence and severity of cardiomegaly by using thoracic radiographs. VHS in rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) has not been validated or used routinely in the clinical or research setting. We hypothesized that rhesus macaques with cardiac disease diagnosed by using echocardiography would have higher VHS than animals without cardiac disease. A total of 150 rhesus macaques were enrolled in this study. All animals underwent echocardiography and thoracic radiography (right lateral [RL], dorsoventral [DV], and ventrodorsal [VD] views).According to echocardiography, 121 rhesus macaques had no cardiac disease and were used to establish reference intervals for VHS. The remaining 29 macaques had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 20) or other cardiac disease (n = 9). Results showed that VHS of RL and VD views were significantly higher in macaques with any of the identified cardiac diseases and in the cardiac disease group that excluded hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. VHS of animals with HCM was not significantly different than that of control animals. In the RL view, VHS was moderately accurate for predicting the presence of cardiac disease, with an AUC of 0.71 and an optimal cut-off value of 10.25 (sensitivity: 62%, specificity: 77%). In the VD view, VHS was a mildly accurate test for cardiac disease, with an AUC of 0.654 and an optimal cut-off value of 10.65 (sensitivity, 66%;specificity, 63%). Study results indicated that VHS could be a useful screening tool for clinically identifying rhesus macaques with cardiac disease. However, VHS is unlikely to replace echocardiographic examination for determining the presence, type,and severity of cardiac disease in this species.

"Echinococcosis is a zoonosis caused by cestodes of the genus Echinococcus (family Taeniidae). This serious and near-cosmopolitan disease continues to be a significant public health issue, with western China being the area of highest endemicity for both the cystic (CE) and alveolar (AE) forms of echinococcosis. Considerable advances have been made in the 21st century on the genetics, genomics, and molecular epidemiology of the causative parasites, on diagnostic tools, and on treatment techniques and control strategies, including the development and deployment of vaccines. In terms of surgery, new procedures have superseded traditional techniques, and total cystectomy in CE, ex vivo resection with autotransplantation in AE, and percutaneous and perendoscopic procedures in both diseases have improved treatment efficacy and the quality of life of patients. In this review, we summarize recent progress on the biology, epidemiology, diagnosis, management, control, and prevention of CE and AE. Currently there is no alternative drug to albendazole to treat echinococcosis, and new compounds are required urgently. Recently acquired genomic and proteomic information can provide a platform for improving diagnosis and for finding new drug and vaccine targets, with direct impact in the future on the control of echinococcosis, which continues to be a global challenge.

"P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/ABCB1 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2 are highly expressed in the placenta and fetus throughout gestation and can modulate exposure and toxicity of drugs and xenobiotics to the vulnerable fetus during the sensitive times of growth and development. We aim to provide an update on current knowledge on placental and fetal expressions of the two transporters in different species, and to provide insight on interpreting transporter expression and fetal exposure relative to the concept of fraction of drug transported. Areas covered: Comprehensive literature review through PubMed (primarily from July 2010 to February 2018) on P-gp and BCRP expression and function in the placenta and fetus of primarily human, mouse, rat, and guinea pig. Expert opinion: While there are many commonalities in the expression and function of P-gp and BCRP in the placenta and fetal tissues across species, there are distinct differences in expression levels and temporal changes. Further studies are needed to quantify protein abundance of these transporters and functionally assess their activities at various gestational stages. Combining the knowledge of interspecies differences and the concept of fraction of drug transported, we may better predict the magnitude of impact these transporters have on fetal drug exposure.

"Does anthropogenic environmental change constrain long-term sociopolitical outcomes? It is clear that human colonization of islands radically alters their biological and physical systems. Despite considerable contextual variability in local specificities of this alteration, I argue that these processes are to some extent regular, predictable, and have socio-political implications. Reviewing the data for post-colonization ecodynamics, I show that Neolithic colonization of previously insulated habitats drives biotic homogenization. I argue that we should expect such homogenization to promote regular types of change in biophysical systems, types of change that can be described in sum as environmentally convergent. Such convergence should have significant implications for human social organization over the long term, and general dynamics of this sort are relevant in the context of understanding remarkably similar social evolutionary trajectories towards wealth-inequality not only islands, but also more generally.

"The presence of ticks inside human constructions was evaluated in two localities from Colon province (Charco La Piedra and Espinar) and one from Panama province (Ancon, City of Panama). In two of houses, eight people from Charco La Piedra and one from Ancón reported ""insect bites,"" which produced blisters for several weeks. The investigation resulted in the collection of argasid ticks, which were identified by morphology and sequencing the 16s ribosomal RNA gene, and later evaluated for the presence of relapsing fever Borrelia DNA. All ticks were identified as Ornithodoros puertoricensis. While spirochetal DNA was not detected by PCR in the ticks, our report highlights the potential for relapsing fever borreliosis in rural and urban localities in Panama.

"Diverse features of sensory stimuli are selectively processed in distinct brain areas. The relative recruitment of inhibitory and excitatory neurons within an area controls the gain of neurons for appropriate stimulus coding. We examined how such a balance of inhibition and excitation is differentially recruited across multiple levels of a cortical hierarchy by mapping the locations and strengths of synaptic inputs to pyramidal and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons in feedforward and feedback pathways interconnecting primary (V1) and two higher visual areas. While interareal excitation was stronger in PV than in pyramidal neurons in all layer 2/3 pathways, we observed a gradual scaling down of the inhibition/excitation ratio from the most feedforward to the most feedback pathway. Our results indicate that interareal gain control depends on the hierarchical position of the source and the target, the direction of information flow through the network, and the laminar location of target neurons.

"Wild meat or ‘bushmeat’ has long served as a principal source of protein and a key contributor to the food security of millions of people across the developing world, most notably in Africa, Latin America and Asia. More recently, however, growing human populations, technological elaborations and the emergence of a booming commercial bushmeat trade have culminated in unprecedented harvest rates and the consequent decline of numerous wildlife populations. Most research efforts aimed at tackling this problem to date have been rooted in the biological disciplines, focused on quantifying the trade and measuring its level of destruction on wildlife and ecosystems. Comparatively little effort, on the other hand, has been expended on illuminating the role of bushmeat in human livelihoods and in providing alternative sources of food and income, as well as the infrastructure to make these feasible. This paper aims to shift the focus to the human dimension, emphasising the true contributions of bushmeat to food security, nutrition and well-being, while balancing this perspective by considering the far-reaching impacts of overexploitation. What emerges from this synthesis is that bushmeat management will ultimately depend on understanding and working with people, with any approaches focused too narrowly on biodiversity preservation running the risk of failure in the long term. If wildlife is to survive and be utilised in the future, there is undoubtedly a need to relax adherence to unswerving biocentric or anthropocentric convictions, to appreciate the necessity for certain trade-offs and to develop integrated and flexible approaches that reconcile the requirements of both the animals and the people.

"Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease possess extensive genetic diversity. This has led to the development of a plethora of molecular typing methods for the identification of both the known major genetic lineages and for more fine scale characterization of different multilocus genotypes within these major lineages. Whole genome sequencing applied to large sample sizes is not currently viable and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, the previous gold standard for T. cruzi typing, is laborious and time consuming. In the present work, we present an optimized Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme, based on the combined analysis of two recently proposed MLST approaches. Here, thirteen concatenated gene fragments were applied to a panel of T. cruzi reference strains encompassing all known genetic lineages. Concatenation of 13 fragments allowed assignment of all strains to the predicted Discrete Typing Units (DTUs), or near-clades, with the exception of one strain that was an outlier for TcV, due to apparent loss of heterozygosity in one fragment. Monophyly for all DTUs, along with robust bootstrap support, was restored when this fragment was subsequently excluded from the analysis. All possible combinations of loci were assessed against predefined criteria with the objective of selecting the most appropriate combination of between two and twelve fragments, for an optimized MLST scheme. The optimum combination consisted of 7 loci and discriminated between all reference strains in the panel, with the majority supported by robust bootstrap values. Additionally, a reduced panel of just 4 gene fragments displayed high bootstrap values for DTU assignment and discriminated 21 out of 25 genotypes. We propose that the seven-fragment MLST scheme could be used as a gold standard for T. cruzi typing, against which other typing approaches, particularly single locus approaches or systematic PCR assays based on amplicon size, could be compared.

"Researchers sometimes face difficulties in the diagnosis of pregnancy and assessment of embryonic development. Ultrasonography (US) is a non-invasive imaging method with minimal side effects on the subjects or operators. It provides real-time evaluation of the physiology of rapidly moving structures (i.e., heart) and facilitates evaluation of fetal tissue development. US discerns tissues based on composition, making it the imaging method of choice for abdominal examination. In this study we used real-time US as an alternative method for early diagnosis of pregnancy in rats. Sixty-four Wistar rats aged 16-20 wk were examined, and day 8 was the earliest point at which pregnancy could be detected. We constructed a detailed timeline of embryonic features detectable by US on days 8 to 19. We trust this index will be a valuable tool. More refined work toward a more detailed ""atlas"" will help to reduce animal sacrifice during embryonic development studies.

"A serological survey of Toxoplasma gondii was conducted on 766 domestic and peridomestic rodents from 46 trapping sites throughout the city of Niamey, Niger. A low seroprevalence was found over the whole town with only 1.96% of the rodents found seropositive. However, differences between species were important, ranging from less than 2% in truly commensal Mastomys natalensis, Rattus rattus and Mus musculus, while garden-associated Arvicanthis niloticus displayed 9.1% of seropositive individuals. This is in line with previous studies on tropical rodents--that we reviewed here--which altogether show that Toxoplasma seroprevalence in rodent is highly variable, depending on many factors such as locality and/or species. Moreover, although we were not able to decipher statistically between habitat or species effect, such a contrast between Nile grass rats and the other rodent species points towards a potentially important role of environmental toxoplasmic infection. This would deserve to be further scrutinised since intra-city irrigated cultures are extending in Niamey, thus potentially increasing Toxoplasma circulation in this yet semi-arid region. As far as we are aware of, our study is one of the rare surveys of its kind performed in Sub-Saharan Africa and the first one ever conducted in the Sahel.

"Trinidad, like many other American regions, experiences repeated epizootics of yellow fever virus (YFV). However, it is unclear whether these result from in situ evolution (enzootic maintenance) or regular reintroduction of YFV from the South American mainland. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we carried out a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis of over 100 prM/E gene sequences sampled from 8 South American countries. These included newly sequenced isolates from the recent 2008-2009 Trinidad epizootic and isolates derived from mainland countries within the last decade. The results indicate that the most recent common ancestor of the 2008-2009 epizootic existed in Trinidad 4.2 years prior to 2009 (95% highest probability density [HPD], 0.5 to 9.0 years). Our data also suggest a Trinidad origin for the progenitor of the 1995 Trinidad epizootic and support in situ evolution of YFV between the 1979 and 1988-1989 Trinidad epizootics. Using the same phylogeographic approach, we also inferred the historical spread of YFV in the Americas. The results suggest a Brazilian origin for YFV in the Americas and an overall dispersal rate of 182 km/year (95% HPD, 52 to 462 km/year), with Brazil as the major source population for surrounding countries. There is also strong statistical support for epidemiological links between four Brazilian regions and other countries. In contrast, while there were well-supported epidemiological links within Peru, the only statistically supported external link was a relatively weak link with neighboring Bolivia. Lastly, we performed a complete analysis of the genome of a newly sequenced Trinidad 2009 isolate, the first complete genome for a genotype I YFV isolate.

"BACKGROUND: Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with multiple functions that regulates energy homeostasis and reproductive functions. Increased knowledge of leptin receptor function will enhance our understanding of the physiological roles of leptin in animals. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, a full-length leptin receptor (lepr) cDNA, consisting of 1,353 nucleotides, was cloned from Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) following the identification of a single expressed sequence tag (EST) clone in a cDNA library. The lepr cDNA consisted of a 22-nucleotide 5'-untranslated region (5' UTR), a 402-nucleotide open reading frame (ORF) and a 929-nucleotide 3' UTR. Multiple sequence alignments revealed that Chinese mitten crab lepr shared a conserved vacuolar protein sorting 55 (Vps55) domain with other species. Chinese mitten crab lepr expression was determined in various tissues and at three different reproductive stages using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Lepr expression was highest in the intestine, thoracic ganglia, gonad, and accessory gonad, moderate in hepatopancreas and cranial ganglia, and low in muscle, gill, heart, haemocytes, and stomach. Furthermore, lepr expression was significantly higher in the intestine, gonad and thoracic ganglia in immature crabs relative to precocious and mature crabs. In contrast, lepr expression was significantly lower in the hepatopancreas of immature crabs relative to mature crabs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We are the first to identify the lepr gene and to determine its gene expression patterns in various tissues and at three different reproductive stages in Chinese mitten crab. Taken together, our results suggest that lepr may be involved in the nutritional regulation of metabolism and reproduction in Chinese mitten crabs.

"BACKGROUND: Human capillariasis caused by Capillaria hepatica (syn. Calodium hepaticum) is a rare disease with no more than 40 cases registered around the world. Classically, the disease has severe symptoms that mimic acute hepatitis. Natural reservoirs of C. hepatica are urban rodents (Mus musculus and Rattus novergicus) that harbor their eggs in the liver. After examining the feces of 6 riverine inhabitants (Rio Preto area, 8 degrees 03'S and 62 degrees 53' W to 8 degrees 14'S and 62 degrees 52'W) of the State of Rondonia, Brazil, and identifying C. hepatica eggs in their feces, the authors decided to investigate the real dimension of these findings by looking for two positive signals. METHODS: Between June 1st and 15th, 2008, 246 out of 304 individuals were clinically examined. Blood samples were collected, kept under -20 degrees C, and test by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. RESULTS: The first positive signal was the presence of specific antibodies at 1:150 dilution, which indicates that the person is likely to have been exposed to eggs, most likely non-infective eggs, passing through the food chain or via contaminated food (total prevalence of 34.1%). A second more specific signal was the presence of antibodies at higher titers, thus indicating true infection. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that only two subjects were really infected (prevalence of 0.81%); the rest was false-positives that were sensitized after consuming non-embryonated eggs. The present study is the first one carried out in a native Amazonian population and indicates the presence of antibodies against C. hepatica in this population. The results further suggest that the transmission of the parasite occurs by the ingestion of embryonated eggs from human feces and/or carcasses of wild animals. The authors propose a novel mode of transmission, describing the disease as a low pathogenic one, and showing low infectivity.

"BACKGROUND: Ethnomedicines are used by hunters for themselves and their hunting dogs in Trinidad. Plants are used for snakebites, scorpion stings, for injuries and mange of dogs and to facilitate hunting success. RESULTS: Plants used include Piper hispidum, Pithecelobium unguis-cati, Bauhinia excisa, Bauhinia cumanensis, Cecropia peltata, Aframomum melegueta, Aristolochia rugosa, Aristolochia trilobata, Jatropha curcas, Jatropha gossypifolia, Nicotiana tabacum, Vernonia scorpioides, Petiveria alliacea, Renealmia alpinia, Justicia secunda, Phyllanthus urinaria,Phyllanthus niruri,Momordica charantia, Xiphidium caeruleum, Ottonia ovata, Lepianthes peltata, Capsicum frutescens, Costus scaber, Dendropanax arboreus, Siparuma guianensis, Syngonium podophyllum, Monstera dubia, Solanum species, Eclipta prostrata, Spiranthes acaulis, Croton gossypifolius, Barleria lupulina, Cola nitida, Acrocomia ierensis (tentative ID). CONCLUSION: Plant use is based on odour, and plant morphological characteristics and is embedded in a complex cultural context based on indigenous Amerindian beliefs. It is suggested that the medicinal plants exerted a physiological action on the hunter or his dog. Some of the plants mentioned contain chemicals that may explain the ethnomedicinal and ethnoveterinary use. For instance some of the plants influence the immune system or are effective against internal and external parasites. Plant baths may contribute to the health and well being of the hunting dogs.

"Sarcoptic mange caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei is a worldwide-distributed skin infestation with a wide range of hosts, among them several species within the Felidae family. Sarcoptes scabiei was diagnosed in a dead adult female European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) from Spain, based on histological evaluation of skin biopsies and identification of the arthropod from skin scrapings and molecular methods. This is the first description of Sarcoptes scabiei in a European wildcat. Due to its critical demography in the southernmost population of the Iberian Peninsula, the impacts of infectious diseases, including sarcoptic mange, as a new potential threat should be considered during disease surveillance programs of the species' populations.

"While numerous genomes of Leishmania spp. have been sequenced and analyzed, an understanding of the evolutionary history of these organisms remains limited due to the unavailability of the sequence data for their closest known relatives, Endotrypanum and Porcisia spp., infecting sloths and porcupines. We have sequenced and analyzed genomes of three members of this clade in order to fill this gap. Their comparative analyses revealed only minute differences from Leishmaniamajor genome in terms of metabolic capacities. We also documented that the number of genes under positive selection on the Endotrypanum/Porcisia branch is rather small, with the flagellum-related group of genes being over-represented. Most significantly, the analysis of gene family evolution revealed a substantially reduced repertoire of surface proteins, such as amastins and biopterin transporters BT1 in the Endotrypanum/Porcisia species when compared to amastigote-dwelling Leishmania. This reduction was especially pronounced for δ-amastins, a subfamily of cell surface proteins crucial in the propagation of Leishmania amastigotes inside vertebrate macrophages and, apparently, dispensable for Endotrypanum/Porcisia, which do not infect such cells.

"Oral candidiasis is widely spread in both humans and animals, which is caused mainly by Candida albicans. In this study, we aimed to biosynthesize silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) for the first time using the Lotus lalambensis Schweinf leaf extract (L-AgNPs) and investigated their anti-candidal potency alone or in combination with the leaf extract of L. lalambensis (L-AgNPs/LL) against C. albicans. The biosynthesized L-AgNPs were characterized by imaging (transmission electron microscopy, TEM), UV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results of the disk diffusion method showed the potent synergistic anti-candidal activity of L-AgNPs/LL (24 mm inhibition zone). L-AgNPs/LL completely inhibited the morphogenesis of C. albicans and suppressed the adhesion and the formation of the biofilm of C. albicans by 82.5 and 78.7%, respectively. Further, L-AgNPs/LL inhibited the production of antioxidant enzymes of C. albicans by 80%. SEM and TEM revealed deteriorations in the cell wall ultrastructure in L-AgNPs/LL-treated C. albicans. Interestingly, L-AgNPs/LL showed less than 5% cytotoxicity when examined with either the primary bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMSCs) or MCF-7 cell line at MIC values of L-AgNPs/LL. In conclusion, we identified L-AgNPs/LL as a potential biosynthesized-based drug for oral candidiasis in humans and animals.

"Euglenozoa is a species-rich group of protists, which have extremely diverse lifestyles and a range of features that distinguish them from other eukaryotes. They are composed of free-living and parasitic kinetoplastids, mostly free-living diplonemids, heterotrophic and photosynthetic euglenids, as well as deep-sea symbiontids. Although they form a well-supported monophyletic group, these morphologically rather distinct groups are almost never treated together in a comparative manner, as attempted here. We present an updated taxonomy, complemented by photos of representative species, with notes on diversity, distribution and biology of euglenozoans. For kinetoplastids, we propose a significantly modified taxonomy that reflects the latest findings. Finally, we summarize what is known about viruses infecting euglenozoans, as well as their relationships with ecto- and endosymbiotic bacteria.

"BACKGROUND: Between February and April 2016, a slight increase in mortality was observed in a colony consisting of 400 captive Seba's short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata). These animals cohabited with other nocturnal animal species in a dome of a private zoo in Switzerland. RESULTS: Gross and histological analysis of two (14.3%) out of the 13 animals submitted for necropsy within this period revealed a necrosuppurative pneumonia, hepatitis, splenitis, enterocolitis, and endometritis, with abundant intralesional colonies of Gram-negative rods. Yersinia (Y.) pseudotuberculosis serotype O:1 and biotype 1 belonging to the sequence type ST90 was isolated from the affected organs in both animals. Following this diagnosis, ¼ of the colony (99 animals) was culled and submitted for gross and histopathological analysis, and a bacterial culture selective for Yersinia spp. of lung, liver, and spleen was performed. From these 99 animals, one gravid female was tested and found to be positive for Y. pseudotuberculosis in the absence of clinical symptoms and histopathological lesions. PCR analysis of altogether three bacterial isolates for virulence factors revealed the presence of the ail gene, and one isolate was also positive for the virF and yadA plasmid genes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Carollia perspicillata are susceptible to lethal yersiniosis but do not represent a regular reservoir for Y. pseudotuberculosis. Culling of ¼ of the population was sufficient to limit the spread of this infection among the colony. Moreover, no infections were detected in cohabitant nocturnal animals and caretakers, indicating that the zoonotic risk in this case was low.

"The crested porcupine is a widespread naturalized Italian rodent of African origin; nevertheless, very little information on the population abundance and its health status is available. In this study, the hematological and serum chemistry profile of 10 free-ranging captured crested porcupines was established for the first time. The mean hematological values resulted: 5.7 SD 0.4 M/μL for red blood cells; 13.6 SD 0.8 g/dL for hemoglobin; 77.3 SD 5.7 fL for mean corpuscular volume and 30.1 SD 4.7 g/dL for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration; 14.4 SD 7.2 K/μL for white blood cells; and 557.0 SD 469.9 K/μL for platelets. The mean urea and creatinine values resulted with 19.8 SD 8.3 mg/dL and 1.6 SD 3.0 mg/dL, respectively. The mean value of total protein was 6.7 SD 1.0 g/dL, with values of albumin higher than globulins. The mean activity of creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and alkaline phosphatase was 927.3 SD 607.6 U/L, 199.2 SD 70.8 U/L, 16.9 SD 13.7 U/L, and 256 SD 75.8 U/L, respectively. Highest values of alkaline phosphatase were recorded in two porcupines presenting severe injuries with clear signs of infection. These preliminary results may be a helpful tool in order to assess porcupine health status.

"An adult female Cape porcupine (Hystrix africaeaustralis) was presented because of marked abdominal distension, acute dyspnea, and lethargy. Physical examination and standard radiographs revealed marked and diffuse gaseous dilation of the stomach and intestines of undetermined origin. The porcupine died despite medical therapy and surgical intervention. Postmortem examination revealed chronic fungal (Aspergillus flavus) rhinitis. Given that rodents are obligate nasal breathers, the rhinitis likely resulted in substantial upper airway obstruction leading to aerophagia.

"Trypanosoma cruzi is the agent of Chagas disease, transmitted by hematophagous triatomine vectors. Establishing transmission cycles is key to understand the epidemiology of the disease, but integrative assessments of ecological interactions shaping parasite transmission are still limited. Current approaches also lack sensitivity to assess the full extent of this ecological diversity. Here we developed a metabarcoding approach based on next-generation sequencing to identify triatomine gut microbiome, vertebrate feeding hosts, and parasite diversity and their potential interactions. We detected a dynamic microbiome in Triatoma dimidiata, including 23 bacterial orders, which differed according to blood sources. Fourteen vertebrate species served as blood sources, corresponding to domestic, synantropic and sylvatic species, although four (human, dog, cow and mice) accounted for over 50% of blood sources. Importantly, bugs fed on multiple hosts, with up to 11 hosts identified per bug, indicating very frequent host-switching. A high clonal diversity of T. cruzi was detected, with up to 20 haplotypes per bug. This analysis provided much greater sensitivity to detect multiple blood meals and multiclonal infections with T. cruzi, which should be taken into account to develop transmission networks, and characterize the risk for human infection, eventually leading to a better control of disease transmission.

"BACKGROUND: This review article summarizes and updates the knowledge on paracoccidioidomycosis. P lutzii and the cryptic species of P. brasiliensis and their geographical distribution in Latin America, explaining the difficulties observed in the serological diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: Emphasis has been placed on some genetic factors as predisposing condition for paracoccidioidomycosis. Veterinary aspects were focused, showing the wide distribution of infection among animals. The cell-mediated immunity was better characterized, incorporating the recent findings. METHODS: Serological methods for diagnosis were also compared for their parameters of accuracy, including the analysis of relapse. RESULTS: Clinical forms have been better classified in order to include the pictures less frequently observesiod. CONCLUSION: Itraconazole and the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole combination was compared regarding efficacy, effectiveness and safety, demonstrating that azole should be the first choice in the treatment of paracoccidioidomycosis.

"Since, there is no study reporting the mechanism of azole resistance among yeasts isolated from aquatic environments; the present study aims to investigate the occurrence of antifungal resistance among yeasts isolated from an aquatic environment, and assess the efflux-pump activity of the azole-resistant strains to better understand the mechanism of resistance for this group of drugs. For this purpose, monthly water and sediment samples were collected from Catú Lake, Ceará, Brazil, from March 2011 to February 2012. The obtained yeasts were identified based on morphological and biochemical characteristics. Of the 46 isolates, 37 were Candida spp., 4 were Trichosporon asahii, 3 were Cryptococcus laurentii, 1 Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, and 1 was Kodamaea ohmeri. These isolates were subjected to broth microdilution assay with amphotericin B, itraconazole, and fluconazole, according to the methodology standardized by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amphotericin B, itraconazole, and fluconazole were 0.03125-2μg/mL, 0.0625 to ≥16μg/mL, and 0.5 to ≥64μg/mL, respectively, and 13 resistant azole-resistant Candida isolates were detected. A reduction in the azole MICs leading to the phenotypical reversal of the azole resistance was observed upon addition of efflux-pump inhibitors. These findings suggest that the azole resistance among environmental Candida spp. is most likely associated with the overexpression of efflux-pumps.

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Parasites of the subgenus Leishmania (Viannia) cause varying clinical symptoms ranging from cutaneous leishmaniases (CL) with single or few lesions, disseminated CL (DL) with multiple lesions to disfiguring forms of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). In this population genetics study, 37 strains of L. (V.) guyanensis, 63 of L. (V.) braziliensis, four of L. (V.) shawi, six of L. (V.) lainsoni, seven of L. (V.) naiffi, one each of L. (V.) utingensis and L. (V.) lindenbergi, and one L. (V.) lainsoni/L. naiffi hybrid from different endemic foci in Brazil were examined for variation at 15 hyper-variable microsatellite markers. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The multilocus microsatellite profiles obtained for the 120 strains were analysed using both model- and distance-based methods. Significant genetic diversity was observed for all L. (Viannia) strains studied. The two cluster analysis approaches identified two principal genetic groups or populations, one consisting of strains of L. (V.) guyanensis from the Amazon region and the other of strains of L. (V.) braziliensis isolated along the Atlantic coast of Brazil. A third group comprised a heterogeneous assembly of species, including other strains of L. braziliensis isolated from the north of Brazil, which were extremely polymorphic. The latter strains seemed to be more closely related to those of L. (V.) shawi, L. (V.) naiffi, and L. (V.) lainsoni, also isolated in northern Brazilian foci. The MLMT approach identified an epidemic clone consisting of 13 strains of L. braziliensis from Minas Gerais, but evidence for recombination was obtained for the populations of L. (V.) braziliensis from the Atlantic coast and for L. (V.) guyanensis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Different levels of recombination versus clonality seem to occur within the subgenus L. (Viannia). Though clearly departing from panmixia, sporadic, but long-term sustained recombination might explain the tremendous genetic diversity and limited population structure found for such L. (Viannia) strains.

"American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis is caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania, and causes significant health problems throughout the Americas. In Panama, Leishmania parasites are endemic, causing thousands of new cases every year, mostly of the cutaneous form. In the last years, the burden of the disease has increased, coincident with increasing disturbances in its natural sylvatic environments. The study of genetic variation in parasites is important for a better understanding of the biology, population genetics, and ultimately the evolution and epidemiology of these organisms. Very few attempts have been made to characterize genetic polymorphisms of parasites isolated from Panamanian patients of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Here we present data on the genetic variability of local isolates of Leishmania, as well as specimens from several other species, by means of Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLP), a technique seldom used to study genetic makeup of parasites. We demonstrate that this technique allows detection of very high levels of genetic variability in local isolates of Leishmania panamensis in a highly reproducible manner. The analysis of AFLP fingerprints generated by unique selective primer combinations in L. panamensis suggests a predominant clonal mode of reproduction. Using fluorescently labeled primers, many taxon-specific fragments were identified which may show potential as species diagnostic fragments. The AFLP permitted a high resolution genetic analysis of the Leishmania genus, clearly separating certain groups among L. panamensis specimens and highly related species such as L. panamensis and L. guyanensis. The phylogenetic networks reconstructed from our AFLP data are congruent with established taxonomy for the genus Leishmania, even when using single selective primer combinations. Results of this study demonstrate that AFLP polymorphisms can be informative for genetic characterization in Leishmania parasites, at both intra and inter-specific levels.

"Paracoccidioidomycosis is an acute - to chronic systemic mycosis caused by fungi of the genus Paracoccidioides. Due to its frequent tegument clinical expression, paracoccidioidomycosis is an important disease for dermatologists, who must be up-to-date about it. This article focuses on recent epidemiological data and discusses the new insights coming from molecular studies, as well as those related to clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects. In the latter section, we give particular attention to the guideline on paracoccidioidomycosis organized by specialists in this subject.

"BACKGROUND: Anthropogenic land use may influence transmission of multi-host vector-borne pathogens by changing diversity, relative abundance, and community composition of reservoir hosts. These reservoir hosts may have varying competence for vector-borne pathogens depending on species-specific characteristics, such as life history strategy. The objective of this study is to evaluate how anthropogenic land use change influences blood meal species composition and the effects of changing blood meal species composition on the parasite infection rate of the Chagas disease vector Rhodnius pallescens in Panama. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: R. pallescens vectors (N = 643) were collected in different habitat types across a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. Blood meal species in DNA extracted from these vectors was identified in 243 (40.3%) vectors by amplification and sequencing of a vertebrate-specific fragment of the 12SrRNA gene, and T. cruzi vector infection was determined by pcr. Vector infection rate was significantly greater in deforested habitats as compared to contiguous forests. Forty-two different species of blood meal were identified in R. pallescens, and species composition of blood meals varied across habitat types. Mammals (88.3%) dominated R. pallescens blood meals. Xenarthrans (sloths and tamanduas) were the most frequently identified species in blood meals across all habitat types. A regression tree analysis indicated that blood meal species diversity, host life history strategy (measured as r(max), the maximum intrinsic rate of population increase), and habitat type (forest fragments and peridomiciliary sites) were important determinants of vector infection with T. cruzi. The mean intrinsic rate of increase and the skewness and variability of r(max) were positively associated with higher vector infection rate at a site. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, anthropogenic landscape disturbance increased vector infection with T. cruzi, potentially by changing host community structure to favor hosts that are short-lived with high reproductive rates. Study results apply to potential environmental management strategies for Chagas disease.

"The scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies on both male and female tick, Amblyomma gervaisi (Lucas 1847) inhabiting the snake Naja naja were made. Detail of the surface structures as seen under SEM exhibit sexual dimorphism and were compared with other tick species as reported. SEM observations show characteristic alloscutal ornamentation, inornate festoons, triangular licking organ, size of the hypostome, round Haller's organ, genital plate oval in male and slit-like in female, and prominent marginated anal plate. The findings of the present study address the diversity in surface ultrastructure among snake ticks which would help in tick biosystematics.

"Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) methods are now useful for the detection of a specific gene in infectious diseases, genetic diseases, and/or genetic disorders in the large number of medical fields, and it was recently introduced to fungal investigation. It is characterized by the use of four different primers specifically designed to recognize six distinct regions of the target gene, and the reaction process proceeds at a constant temperature using strand displacement reaction. Quickness and simplicity is the advantage of the method. Amplification and detection of gene can be completed in a single step, by incubating the mixture of samples, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates at a constant temperature. The method was applied to two fungal infections; paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), a deep mycosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and Ochroconis gallopava infection. For PCM a combination of F3, B3, FIP, and BIP primers designed from the partial sequence of P. brasiliensis gp43 gene was used. The PCR products amplified by the primer set; F3 and B3 showed species specificity for P. brasiliensis and the detection limit of the PCR was 100 fg of fungal genomic DNA. The specific DNA banding pattern of P. brasiliensis was detected in the clinical and nine-banded armadillo derived isolates, paraffin-embedded tissue sample or sputum from PCM patient. LAMP method was used also for the identification of O. gallopava by using species-specific primer sets based on the D1/D2 domain of the LSU rDNA sequence. The method successfully detected the gene from both fungal DNA derived from brains and spleens of experimentally-infected mice with O. gallopava and environmental isolates. In conclusion, LAMP method for PCM and O. gallopava seemed to be useful for identification, diagnosis or retrospective study with advantage in the quickness and simplicity procedure, but require strictly-controlled environments.

"The most common presentation of symptomatic postnatally acquired toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent patients is painless cervical adenopathy. Acute visceral manifestations are associated in rare cases. We report 16 cases of severe primary toxoplasmosis diagnosed in French Guiana during a 6.5-year period. All of the subjects were immunocompetent adults hospitalized with clinical presentations consisting of a marked, nonspecific infectious syndrome accompanied by an altered general status with at least one visceral localization, mainly pulmonary involvement (14 cases). Acute toxoplasmosis was diagnosed according to the results of serological tests suggestive of recent primary infection and the absence of an alternative etiology. Recovery was rapid following specific antitoxoplasmosis treatment. Thirteen of the 16 patients had consumed game in the 2 weeks before the onset of the symptoms, and in eight cases the game was considered to have been undercooked. Toxoplasma strains, which were virulent in mice, were isolated from three patients. Microsatellite analysis showed that all of these isolates exhibited an atypical multilocus genotype, with one allele found only for isolates of this region.

"Dermatophytes are filamentous fungi with the ability to digest and grow on keratinized substrates. The ongoing improvements in fungal detection techniques give new scope for clinical implementations in laboratories and veterinary clinics, including the monitoring of the disease and carrier status. The technologically advanced methods for dermatophyte detection include molecular methods based on PCR. In this context, the aim of this study was to carry out tests on the occurrence of dermatophytes in cattle herds using qPCR methods and a comparative analysis with conventional methods. Each sample collected from ringworm cases and from asymptomatic cattle was divided into three parts and subjected to the real-time PCR technique, direct light microscopy analysis, and culture-based methods. The use of the real-time PCR technique with pan-dermatophyte primers detected the presence of dermatophytes in the sample with a 10.84% (45% vs. 34.17%) higher efficiency than direct analysis with light microscopy. Moreover, a dermatophyte culture was obtained from all samples with a positive qPCR result. In conclusion, it seems that this method can be used with success to detect dermatophytes and monitor cowsheds in ringworm cases and carriers in cattle.

"Papillomaviruses (PVs) are considered highly species-specific with cospeciation as the main driving force in their evolution. However, a recent increase in the available PV genome sequences has revealed inconsistencies in virus-host phylogenies, which could be explained by adaptive radiation, recombination, host-switching events and a broad PV host range. Unfortunately, with a relatively low number of animal PVs characterized, understanding these incongruities remains elusive. To improve knowledge of biology and the spread of animal PV, we collected 60 swabs of the anogenital and head and neck regions from a healthy colony of 30 Roborovski hamsters (Phodopus roborovskii) and detected PVs in 44/60 (73.3%) hamster samples. This is the first report of PV infection in Roborovski hamsters. Moreover, Phodopus sungorus papillomavirus type 1 (PsuPV1), previously characterized in Siberian hamsters (Phodopus sungorus), was the only PV detected in Roborovski hamsters. In addition, after a detailed literature search, review and summary of published evidence and construction of a tanglegram linking the cladograms of PVs and their hosts, our findings were discussed in the context of available knowledge on PVs described in at least two different host species.

"Since the early times, human beings have always been faced with deadly microbial infections, both bacterial and viral. Pathogens such as viruses are always evolving owing to the processes of antigenic shift and drift. Such viral evolution results in the emergence of new types and serovars that prove deadly for humans-like influenza pandemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The pandemic of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the recent example. It has resulted in a great loss of human lives and a serious burden on economy across the globe. To counter such situations, a system should exist for the early detection of emerging viral pathogens. This will help prevent possible outbreaks and save human lives. Most of such deadly novel viruses and viral outbreaks are known to be originated from animal hosts. Regular monitoring of potential hot spots of such emerging microbes, such as zoos and animal markets, through metagenomics could help assess the presence of new viruses and pathogens. In this review, we focus on the potential of viral metagenomics and propose a surveillance system based on it for the early detection and hence prevention of such emerging viral infections.

"Many arthropod pests of humans and other animals select their preferred hosts by recognising volatile odour compounds contained in the hosts' 'volatilome'. Although there is prolific literature on chemical emissions from humans, published data on volatiles and vector attraction in other species are more sporadic. Despite several decades since the identification of a small number of critical volatiles underpinning specific host-vector relationships, synthetic chemicals or mixtures still largely fail to reproduce the attractiveness of natural hosts to their disease vectors. This review documents allelochemicals from non-human terrestrial animals and considers where challenges in collection and analysis have left shortfalls in animal volatilome research. A total of 1287 volatile organic compounds were identified from 141 species. Despite comparable diversity of entities in each compound class, no specific chemical is ubiquitous in all species reviewed, and over half are reported as unique to a single species. This review provides a rationale for future enquiries by highlighting research gaps, such as disregard for the contribution of breath volatiles to the whole animal volatilome and evaluating the role of allomones as vector deterrents. New opportunities to improve vector surveillance and disrupt disease transmission may be unveiled by understanding the host-associated stimuli that drive vector-host interactions.

"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging and fatal contagious prion disease that affects cervids, including mule deer, white-tailed deer, black-tailed deer, red deer reindeer, elk, and moose. CWD prions are widely distributed throughout the bodies of CWD-infected animals and are found in the nervous system, lymphoid tissues, muscle, blood, urine, feces, and antler velvet. The mechanism of CWD transmission in natural settings is unknown. Potential mechanisms of transmission include horizontal, maternal, or environmental routes. Due to the presence of prions in the blood of CWD-infected animals, the potential exists for invertebrates that feed on mammalian blood to contribute to the transmission of CWD. The geographic range of the Rocky Mountain Wood tick, Dermancentor andersoni, overlaps with CWD throughout the northwest United States and southwest Canada, raising the possibility that D. andersoni parasitization of cervids may be involved in CWD transmission. We investigated this possibility by examining the blood meal of D. andersoni that fed upon prion-infected hamsters for the presence of prion infectivity by animal bioassay. None of the hamsters inoculated with a D. andersoni blood meal that had been ingested from prion-infected hamsters developed clinical signs of prion disease or had evidence for a subclinical prion infection. Overall, the data do not demonstrate a role for D. andersoni in the transmission of prion disease.IMPORTANCE Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emerging prion disease that affects cervids, including mule deer, white-tailed deer, black-tailed deer, red deer reindeer, elk, and moose.

"The expanding geographic ranges of tick species that are known pathogen vectors can have implications for human, domestic animal, and wildlife health. Although Alaska is home to several hard tick species, it has historically been outside of the range of the most common medically important ticks in the contiguous United States and western Canada. To assess the status of tick species establishment in the state and to provide a baseline for tracking future change in the distribution of ticks, we reviewed and compiled historical tick records and summarized recent tick occurrence records collected through the development of the Alaska Submit-A-Tick Program and through tick drag sampling at sentinel sites in southcentral Alaska. Between 1909-2019, there were 1190 tick records representing 4588 individual ticks across 15 species in Alaska. The majority of ticks were species historically found in Alaska: Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, Ixodes angustus, Ixodes auritulus, Ixodes howelli, Ixodes signatus, and Ixodes uriae. Over half of all tick records in the state were collected in the last 10 yr. During this time, the number of tick records and the number of tick species recorded in Alaska each year has increased substantially. Between 2010-2019, there were 611 tick records representing 1921 individual ticks. The most common hosts for reported ticks were domestic animals (n = 343, 56 %) followed by small wild mammals (n = 147, 24 %), humans (n = 49, 8%), and wild birds (n = 31, 5%). Less than 5% of records (n = 25) were of unattached ticks found in the environment. Since 2007, non-native tick species have been documented in the state every year, including Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor andersoni, Dermacentor occidentalis, Dermacentor variabilis, Ixodes pacificus, Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes texanus, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.). Almost half of the records (n = 68, 48 %) of non-native tick species from 2010 to 2019 represented ticks found on a host (usually a dog or a human) that had traveled outside of Alaska in the two weeks prior to collection. However, A. americanum, D. variabilis, I. pacificus, I. texanus, and R. sanguineus s.l. have been found on humans and domestic animals in Alaska without reported recent travel. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that there is local establishment of R. sanguineus s.l. in Alaska. A tick species historically found in the state, I. angustus was frequently found on human and dogs, suggesting a potential role as a bridge vector of pathogens. Given the inconsistency of tick monitoring in Alaska over the past century, it is difficult to draw many conclusions from temporal trends in the data. Continued monitoring through the Alaska Submit-A-Tick Program will allow a more accurate assessment of the changing risk of ticks and tick-borne diseases in the state and provide information for setting clinical and public health guidelines for tick-borne disease prevention.

"BACKGROUND: The detection of known human papillomaviruses (PVs) from targeted wet-lab approaches has traditionally used PCR-based methods coupled with Sanger sequencing. With the introduction of next-generation sequencing (NGS), these approaches can be revisited to integrate the sequencing power of NGS. Although computational tools have been developed for metagenomic approaches to search for known or novel viruses in NGS data, no appropriate tool is available for the classification and identification of novel viral sequences from data produced by amplicon-based methods. RESULTS: We have developed PVAmpliconFinder, a data analysis workflow designed to rapidly identify and classify known and potentially new Papillomaviridae sequences from NGS amplicon sequencing with degenerate PV primers. Here, we describe the features of PVAmpliconFinder and its implementation using biological data obtained from amplicon sequencing of human skin swab specimens and oral rinses from healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: PVAmpliconFinder identified putative new HPV sequences, including one that was validated by wet-lab experiments. PVAmpliconFinder can be easily modified and applied to other viral families. PVAmpliconFinder addresses a gap by providing a solution for the analysis of NGS amplicon sequencing, increasingly used in clinical research. The PVAmpliconFinder workflow, along with its source code, is freely available on the GitHub platform: https://github.com/IARCbioinfo/PVAmpliconFinder.

"As the only component that contacts the ground and rock, the hooves of blue sheep may play a crucial role in their excellent climbing abilities. In this study, we used a combination of techniques, including scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy and nanoindentation, to characterize the surface morphology, structure, material composition, and mechanical properties of blue sheep hoof and investigate the potential contributions of these properties to the establishment of passive contact stability. Straight and curled microscopic lamellar morphology were found on the hoof surfaces. The cross section of the hoof revealed four layers, and each layer had a unique structure. Finite element analysis was employed to verify that the surface morphology and microstructure effectively contributed to the slip resistance and impact cushioning, respectively. Analyses of the energy and infrared spectra showed that the organic and inorganic substances in different regions of the hoof had similar components but different contents of those components. The hoof was mainly composed of keratin. From the outside to the inside, gradients in both the modulus and hardness were observed. These factors help the hoof alleviate high impact strengths and increase contact stability. These findings further our understanding of the unique mechanism of blue sheep hoof and may help in the development of novel biomimetic materials and mechanical components with enhanced friction and contact stability properties.

" Lynx canadensis Kerr, 1792, commonly called the Canada lynx, is a medium size felid and is the second largest of the four species in the genus Lynx. It is distributed throughout the boreal forest of most of Canada and Alaska and across portions of the northern United States. It prefers dense, regenerating coniferous forests with moderate canopy and understory cover. L. canadensis is a snowshoe hare specialist, and its ecology, morphology, and behavior closely reflect that of its main prey. It is listed as “Least Concern” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, is on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and its population size trend is considered stable. However, the status of United States subpopulations, being largely peripheral to the Canadian population, is more tenuous and the species is protected.

"Big, time-scaled phylogenies are fundamental to connecting evolutionary processes to modern biodiversity patterns. Yet inferring reliable phylogenetic trees for thousands of species involves numerous trade-offs that have limited their utility to comparative biologists. To establish a robust evolutionary timescale for all approximately 6,000 living species of mammals, we developed credible sets of trees that capture root-to-tip uncertainty in topology and divergence times. Our ""backbone-and-patch"" approach to tree building applies a newly assembled 31-gene supermatrix to two levels of Bayesian inference: (1) backbone relationships and ages among major lineages, using fossil node or tip dating, and (2) species-level ""patch"" phylogenies with nonoverlapping in-groups that each correspond to one representative lineage in the backbone. Species unsampled for DNA are either excluded (""DNA-only"" trees) or imputed within taxonomic constraints using branch lengths drawn from local birth-death models (""completed"" trees). Joining time-scaled patches to backbones results in species-level trees of extant Mammalia with all branches estimated under the same modeling framework, thereby facilitating rate comparisons among lineages as disparate as marsupials and placentals. We compare our phylogenetic trees to previous estimates of mammal-wide phylogeny and divergence times, finding that (1) node ages are broadly concordant among studies, and (2) recent (tip-level) rates of speciation are estimated more accurately in our study than in previous ""supertree"" approaches, in which unresolved nodes led to branch-length artifacts. Credible sets of mammalian phylogenetic history are now available for download at http://vertlife.org/phylosubsets, enabling investigations of long-standing questions in comparative biology.

"Protecting wild places is conservation's most pressing task given rapid contemporary declines in biodiversity and massive land use changes. We suggest that behavioural ecology has a valuable, albeit limited, role to play in this agenda. Behaviourally based empiricism and modelling, especially of animal movements and habitat preferences have enjoyed wide applicability in delineating reserve boundaries. In protected areas that sanction exploitation, it may also be important to understand individuals' behavioural and life-history responses to management decisions. We also argue, however, that the in-depth studies of behavioural ecologists may have an important role in conservation by elevating species' status from mundane to charismatic and often sparking public empathy, and their mere presence in field generates local (or broader) intrigue. More generally behavioural ecologists will only be listened to, and their contributions considered of conservation importance, if they become more involved in decision-making processes as witnessed by several prominent examples that have supported the establishment of protected areas. This article is part of the theme issue 'Linking behaviour to dynamics of populations and communities: application of novel approaches in behavioural ecology to conservation'.

"Crested screamers, a unique, mainly terrestrial avian species native to South America, are known to have a markedly high chick mortality rate in captivity, ranging from 61% to 94%; however, there is very limited information on this species' natural history within the literature, and even less about common diseases that affect them. Four captive-born crested screamer chicks (Chauna torquata) at a U.S. zoological institution died acutely from different causes over the course of 2.5 months. Although a hands-off approach was initially taken, each chick became acutely weak on exhibit and medical intervention was deemed necessary, but proved unsuccessful in all cases. Necropsy results of the chicks revealed various causes of death, including acute Escherichia coli colitis, aspiration pneumonia complicated by concurrent gastrointestinal Candidiasis, severe dehydration and emaciation, and acute amoebic gastroenteritis. No direct associations were found between these deaths and diet or husbandry; however, the limited literature on this topic suspects inadequate husbandry and immunosuppression to be the greatest cause of chick mortality in this species. The cases presented here are consistent with this hypothesis, but further exemplify the limited knowledge of this species and the need to optimize their survivability and proliferation in captivity.

"The tick-borne pathogen Powassan virus is a rare cause of encephalitis in North America and the Russian Far East. The number of documented cases described since the discovery of Powassan virus in 1958 may be <150, although detection of cases has increased over the past decade. In the United States, the incidence of Powassan virus infections expanded from the estimated 1 case per year prior to 2005 to 10 cases per year during the subsequent decade. The increased detection rate may be associated with several factors, including enhanced surveillance, the availability of improved laboratory diagnostic methods, the expansion of the vector population, and, perhaps, altered human activities that lead to more exposure. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether Powassan virus is indeed an emerging threat or if enzootic cycles in nature remain more-or-less stable with periodic fluctuations of host and vector population sizes. Despite the low disease incidence, the approximately 10% to 15% case fatality rate of neuroinvasive Powassan virus infection and the temporary or prolonged sequelae in >50% of survivors make Powassan virus a medical concern requiring the attention of public health authorities and clinicians. The medical importance of Powassan virus justifies more research on developing specific and effective treatments and prevention and control measures.

"This chapter includes diseases of animals in the order Rodentia, in which there are over 2000 species representing 40% of all mammals. This incredibly diverse order includes members inhabiting every continent, either naturally or in human-made environments. While rodents have been the cause or implicated in disease transmission that has lead to human pandemics, such as the Black Death, and the decimation of certain animal species, like island-dwelling birds; genetically modified rodents have contributed significantly to the advancement of biomedical research and human health. There are more than 50 species of endangered rats, mice, voles, squirrels, and marmots. The recent extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys represents the first human-induced rodent extinction linked to climate change. Rodents are the reservoir host of several human and domestic pathogens of concern listed by OIE. Herein, we highlight those diseases of rodents that lead to clinically important gross and microscopic lesions.

"Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne zoonosis maintained in natural enzootic cycles between ixodid ticks and wild mammals. Reported human cases have increased in recent years; these infections can be fatal or lead to long-term neurologic sequelae. However, both the geographic distribution and the role of common, potential mammalian hosts in POWV transmission are poorly understood, creating challenges to public health surveillance. We looked for evidence of POWV infection among candidate wildlife host species and ticks collected from mammals and birds in southern Ontario. Tissues (including blood) and ticks from trapped wild mammals were collected in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Ticks removed from dogs in 2015-2016 and wildlife diagnostic cases from 2011 to 2013 were also included. Tissue and tick (Ixodes spp.) homogenates were tested for POWV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, sera from wild mammals were tested for antibodies to POWV, West Nile virus (WNV), and heartland virus (HRTV) by plaque reduction neutralization test. All 724 tissue samples were negative for POWV by RT-PCR. One of 53 pools of Ixodes cookei (among 98 total tick pools) was RT-PCR positive for deer tick virus (POWV) lineage. Antibodies to POWV and WNV were detected in 0.4% of 265 and 6.1% of 264 samples, respectively, and all of 219 serum samples tested negative for anti-HRTV antibodies. These results reveal low POWV detection rates in southern Ontario, while highlighting the challenges and need for continued efforts into understanding POWV epidemiology and targeted surveillance strategies.

"Mammalian species differ dramatically in telomere biology. Species larger than 5-10 kg repress somatic telomerase activity and have shorter telomeres, leading to replicative senescence. It has been proposed that evolution of replicative senescence in large-bodied species is an anti-tumour mechanism counteracting increased risk of cancer due to increased cell numbers. By contrast, small-bodied species express high telomerase activity and have longer telomeres. To counteract cancer risk due to longer lifespan, long-lived small-bodied species evolved additional telomere-independent tumour suppressor mechanisms. Here, we tested the connection between telomere biology and tumorigenesis by analysing the propensity of fibroblasts from 18 rodent species to form tumours. We found a negative correlation between species lifespan and anchorage-independent growth. Small-bodied species required inactivation of Rb and/or p53 and expression of oncogenic H-Ras to form tumours. Large-bodied species displayed a continuum of phenotypes requiring additional genetic 'hits' for malignant transformation. Based on these data we refine the model of the evolution of tumour suppressor mechanisms and telomeres. We propose that two different strategies evolved in small and large species because small-bodied species cannot tolerate small tumours that form prior to activation of the telomere barrier, and must instead use telomere-independent strategies that act earlier, at the hyperplasia stage.This article is part of the theme issue 'Understanding diversity in telomere dynamics'.

"Preclinical infection model systems are extremely valuable tools to aid in our understanding of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) biology, disease progression, prevention, and treatments. In this context, rodent papillomaviruses and their respective infection models are useful tools but remain underutilized resources in the field of papillomavirus biology. Two rodent papillomaviruses, MnPV1, which infects the Mastomys species of multimammate rats, and MmuPV1, which infects laboratory mice, are currently the most studied rodent PVs. Both of these viruses cause malignancy in the skin and can provide attractive infection models to study the lesser understood cutaneous papillomaviruses that have been frequently associated with HPV-related skin cancers. Of these, MmuPV1 is the first reported rodent papillomavirus that can naturally infect the laboratory strain of mice. MmuPV1 is an attractive model virus to study papillomavirus pathogenesis because of the ubiquitous availability of lab mice and the fact that this mouse species is genetically modifiable. In this review, we have summarized the knowledge we have gained about PV biology from the study of rodent papillomaviruses and point out the remaining gaps that can provide new research opportunities.

"Neoplasia has been recorded in the vast majority of metazoans. The frequent occurrence of cancer in multicellular organisms suggests that neoplasia, similar to pathogens/parasites, may have a significant negative impact on host fitness in the wild. This is supported by the fact that wildlife cancers have recently been shown to result in significantly increased levels of mortality and concomitant reduction in fitness. By thorough searches of the available literature we provide a comprehensive and an updated list of cancer prevalence and etiology in the wild. We were, however, unable to find data on nontransmissible cancer prevalence in invertebrates and consequently this chapter focuses on cancer in wild vertebrates. Although single cases of cancer are frequently encountered in the wildlife, we were only able to retrieve robust data on cancer prevalence for 31 vertebrate species (12 fish, 3 amphibians, 2 reptiles, 2 birds, and 12 mammals). Cancer prevalence among these vertebrates ranged from as low as 0.2% observed in Canada geese (Branta canadensis) to more than 50% recorded in both Santa Catalina Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis catalinae) and Cape mountain zebras (Equus zebra zebra). The high prevalence recorded in some vertebrates strongly suggests that cancer in wildlife may indeed carry significant fitness costs. In spite of this, the low number of published comprehensive studies clearly shows that so far cancer in wildlife has received insufficient attention by biologists. We hope that this chapter will act as a catalyst for further studies focusing on the impact of cancer in wild animals. The chapter additionally compares cancer recorded in French zoological parks to those obtained at other zoological parks. Finally, we provide an updated list of cancer recorded as single cases in the wild, as well as in captive animals.

"Felis margarita Loche, 1858 is a felid commonly called the sand cat. It is 1 of 6 species in the genus Felis. One of the smallest of the wild cats, Felis margarita, is adapted behaviorally and morphologically to live in desert environments. Prey includes rodents, birds, reptiles, and arthropods. This species has a wide, but disjunct distribution through northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and southwest and central Asia. F. margarita occurs at low densities throughout its range and is listed as “Near Threatened” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources due to habitat degradation and its low and potentially declining population. F. margarita is bred in zoos in North America and Europe.

"During their evolutionary radiation, mammals have colonized diverse habitats. Arguably the subterranean niche is the most inhospitable of these, characterized by reduced oxygen, elevated carbon dioxide, absence of light, scarcity of food, and a substrate that is energetically costly to burrow through. Of all lineages to have transitioned to a subterranean niche, African mole-rats are one of the most successful. Much of their ecological success can be attributed to a diet of plant storage organs, which has allowed them to colonize climatically varied habitats across sub-Saharan Africa, and has probably contributed to the evolution of their diverse social systems. Yet despite their many remarkable phenotypic specializations, little is known about molecular adaptations underlying these traits. To address this, we sequenced the transcriptomes of seven mole-rat taxa, including three solitary species, and combined new sequences with existing genomic data sets. Alignments of more than 13,000 protein-coding genes encompassed, for the first time, all six genera and the full spectrum of ecological and social variation in the clade. We detected positive selection within the mole-rat clade and along ancestral branches in approximately 700 genes including loci associated with tumorigenesis, aging, morphological development, and sociality. By combining these results with gene ontology annotation and protein-protein networks, we identified several clusters of functionally related genes. This family wide analysis of molecular evolution in mole-rats has identified a suite of positively selected genes, deepening our understanding of the extreme phenotypic traits exhibited by this group.

"Cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) have been used to study a variety of infectious agents, particularly human respiratory viral pathogens. During the course of comprehensive pathologic evaluations of aging breeders from our breeding colony, 6 of 22 (27%) female cotton rats had histologic evidence, limited to the lungs, of embolized cells that were confirmed to be trophoblastic in origin by HSD3B1 immunoreactivity. When pulmonary trophoblast emboli were numerous, they usually were associated with additional histologic findings in the lungs, including pulmonary edema and hemorrhage, endothelial hypertrophy, fibrinoid vascular necrosis, and abundant alveolar macrophages containing fresh fibrin and hemolyzing erythrocytes. Of the 6 cotton rats with pulmonary trophoblast emboli, 5 (83%) were at 8 to 18 d of the 27-d gestation period, with the greatest number of emboli per lung present between days 10 through 14. The remaining cotton rat had a focal pulmonary trophoblast embolus and was not pregnant but had delivered a litter 3 mo previously. Three other cotton rats in either the early or late stages of gestation showed no histologic evidence of pulmonary trophoblast deportation. This report is the first to document pulmonary trophoblast emboli in cotton rats. This finding suggests that cotton rats may be an alternative animal model for the study of normal and aberrant trophoblast deportation in routine pregnancies and gestational pathologic conditions in women.

"To assess the host specificity of Enterocytozoon bieneusi and to track the sources of E. bieneusi contamination, we genotyped E. bieneusi in wildlife and stormwater from the watershed of New York City's source water, using ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based PCR and sequence analyses. A total of 255 specimens from 23 species of wild mammals and 67 samples from stormwater were analyzed. Seventy-four (29.0%) of the wildlife specimens and 39 (58.2%) of the stormwater samples from streams were PCR positive. Altogether, 20 E. bieneusi genotypes were found, including 8 known genotypes and 12 new ones. Sixteen and five of the genotypes were seen in animals and stormwater from the watershed, respectively, with WL4 being the most common genotype in both animals (35 samples) and stormwater (23 samples). The 20 E. bieneusi genotypes belonged to five genogroups (groups 1, 3, 4, and 7 and an outlier), with only 23/113 (20.4%) E. bieneusi-positive samples belonging to zoonotic genogroup 1 and 3/20 genotypes ever being detected in humans. The two genogroups previously considered host specific, groups 3 and 4, were both detected in multiple groups of mammals. Thus, with the exception of the type IV, Peru11, and D genotypes, which were detected in only 7, 5, and 2 animals, respectively, most E. bieneusi strains in most wildlife samples and all stormwater samples in the watershed had no known public health significance, as these types have not previously been detected in humans. The role of different species of wild mammals in the contribution of E. bieneusi contamination in stormwater was supported by determinations of host-adapted Cryptosporidium species/genotypes in the same water samples. Data from this study indicate that the host specificity of E. bieneusi group 3 is broader than originally thought, and wildlife is the main source of E. bieneusi in stormwater in the watershed.

"Calodium hepaticum (syn. Capillaria hepatica) is a globally distributed zoonotic nematode with low host specificity and a high affinity to the liver. Although murid rodents are the main definite hosts, various other mammals can be affected with hepatic capillariasis: non-murid rodents, Insectivora, Chiroptera, Lagomorpha, Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Hyracoidea, Marsupialia, Carnivora, and Primates. Overall, more than 180 mammalian species (including humans) are known as suitable hosts of this pathogen. This review gives an overview of the distribution and host spectrum of C. hepaticum in non-Muroidean mammals in wildlife and zoos as well as in domesticated and laboratory animals. Furthermore, the role of spurious infections in animals and the dissemination of C. hepaticum by mammalian and non-mammalian animals are summarized.

"The avian haemosporidian parasites (phylum Apicomplexa) are taxonomically diverse and cosmopolitan in distribution; infecting most bird families. Sources of concern are reports of clinical haemosporidian infections in birds kept as part of zoo and aviary collections. Recently, severe and acute mortality episodes have been reported in masked bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus ridgwayi), an endangered subspecies from the American Southwest. Two hundred and five eggs of the captive flock held in Arivaca, Arizona, were hatched at a zoo in the American Southwest. Thirty-four sub-adult or adult animals had lesions associated with tissue phases of haemoparasites, especially vasculitis, ventricular leiomyositis and ulcerative pododermatitis. Molecular techniques applied to blood collected from the zoo's last twelve remaining animals resulted in the detection of a Plasmodium juxtanucleare-like and Haemoproteus sp. parasites. A Raven (Corvus corax), in a contiguous exhibit, was positive for the same P. juxtanucleare-like parasite, but remained asymptomatic for three years following detection. These findings indicate that other birds in the exhibit within the zoo premises could act as reservoirs. We conclude that haemosporidian infections could be a factor in the demise of the captive masked bobwhite quails housed at the zoo. We suggest that active surveillance for haemoporidian parasites should be incorporated as a precaution to ex situ conservation efforts of susceptible endangered species.

"Betapapillomavirus is a genus of papillomaviruses (PVs) commonly found in human skin and associated with both benign and malignant skin lesions. Only 2 previous beta-PVs have been fully characterized in nonhuman species. This report describes a novel beta-PV, named Macaca fascicularis PV type 2 (MfPV2), isolated from exophytic skin papillomas on the hands and feet of a 2-year-old male cynomolgus monkey (M. fascicularis). On histology the papillomas were composed of diffusely thickened epidermis with superficial foci of cytomegaly, cytoplasmic pallor, marginalized chromatin, and rare eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies. Positive immunostaining for p16 and the proliferation marker Ki67 was present multifocally within affected epidermis, most prominently within basal-type cells. Complete sequence identity (100%) was noted between PV genomes fully sequenced from hand and foot lesions. The MfPV2 genome was 7632 base pairs in length and included putative open reading frames (ORFs) for E1, E2, E4, E6, E7, L1, and L2 genes, similar to other PVs. The closest relatives to MfPV2 based on the L1 ORF sequence were all beta-PVs. These included human PV (HPV) 9, HPV115, HPV76, HPV75, and MfPV1 (60-70% pairwise identity for all), the latter of which was also isolated from hand and foot papillomas in a cynomolgus macaque. Phylogenetic analysis placed MfPV2 in a new species group (beta-6), distinct from HPVs (beta-1 to beta-5) and MfPV1 (beta-1). These findings characterize a new nonhuman beta-PV and provide additional support for the idea that tissue tropism among ancestral primate PVs developed prior to divergence of certain Old World primate lineages.

"We present an expansion of the classification of the family Papillomaviridae, which now contains 29 genera formed by 189 papillomavirus (PV) types isolated from humans (120 types), non-human mammals, birds and reptiles (64, 3 and 2 types, respectively). To accommodate the number of PV genera exceeding the Greek alphabet, the prefix ""dyo"" is used, continuing after the Omega-PVs with Dyodelta-PVs. The current set of human PVs is contained within five genera, whereas mammalian, avian and reptile PVs are contained within 20, 3 and 1 genera, respectively. We propose standardizations to the names of a number of animal PVs. As prerequisite for a coherent nomenclature of animal PVs, we propose founding a reference center for animal PVs. We discuss that based on emerging species concepts derived from genome sequences, PV types could be promoted to the taxonomic level of species, but we do not recommend implementing this change at the current time.

"The first fully sequenced papillomavirus (PV) of marsupials, tentatively named Bettongia penicillata papillomavirus type 1 (BpPV1), was detected in papillomas from a woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi). The circular, double-stranded DNA genome contains 7,737 bp and encodes 7 open reading frames (ORFs), E6, E7, E1, E2, E4, L2, and L1, in typical PV conformation. BpPV1 is a close-to-root PV with L1 and L2 ORFs most similar to European hedgehog PV and bandicoot papillomatosis carcinomatosis virus types 1 and 2 (BPCV1 and -2). It appears that the BPCVs arose by recombination between an ancient PV and an ancient polyomavirus more than 10 million years ago.

"Capillaria hepatica (C. hepatica) is a parasitic nematode causing hepatic capillariasis in numerous mammals. Ecologic studies showed that the first hosts of C. hepatica were rodents, among which rats had relatively high infection rates, which explains why C. hepatica spreads globally. Anatomical studies showed that the liver was the principal site of colonization by these parasites and physical damage tended to occur. Although C. hepatica might lead to serious liver disorders, relevant clinical reports were rare, because of the non-specific nature of clinical symptoms, leading to misdiagnosis. This review mainly focuses on the biological characteristics and epidemiology of C. hepatica in China and histopathologic changes in the liver, with expectation of gaining a better understanding of the disease and seeking more effective treatment.

"The genome organization of the novel human papillomavirus type 108 (HPV108), isolated from a low-grade cervical lesion, deviates from those of other HPVs in lacking an E6 gene. The three related HPV types HPV103, HPV108, and HPV101 were isolated from cervicovaginal cells taken from normal genital mucosa (HPV103) and low-grade (HPV108) and high-grade cervical (HPV101) intraepithelial neoplasia (Z. Chen, M. Schiffman, R. Herrero, R. DeSalle, and R. D. Burk, Virology 360:447-453, 2007, and this report). Their unusual genome organization, against the background of considerable phylogenetic distance from the other HPV types usually associated with lesions of the genital tract, prompted us to investigate whether HPV108 E7 per se is sufficient to induce the above-mentioned clinical lesions. Expression of HPV108 E7 in organotypic keratinocyte cultures increases proliferation and apoptosis, focal nuclear polymorphism, and polychromasia. This is associated with irregular intra- and extracellular lipid accumulation and loss of the epithelial barrier. These alterations are linked to HPV108 E7 binding to pRb and inducing its decrease, an increase in PCNA expression, and BrdU incorporation, as well as increased p53 and p21(CIP1) protein levels. A delay in keratin K10 expression, increased expression of keratins K14 and K16, and loss of the corneal proteins involucrin and loricrin have also been noted. These modifications are suggestive of infection by a high-risk papillomavirus.

"Neurological disease occurred in 4 Patagonian conures (Cyanoliseus patagonus), 2 crested screamer chicks (Chauna torquata), and 1 western Canadian porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum epixanthus) at a Manitoba zoo. Baylisascaris procyonis, the common raccoon roundworm, not previously identified in Manitoba, is considered the likely cause of neural larval migrans in these cases.

"Rabies was undetected in terrestrial wildlife of northern Arizona until 2001, when rabies was diagnosed in 19 rabid skunks in Flagstaff. Laboratory analyses showed causative rabies viruses associated with bats, which indicated cross-species transmission of unprecedented magnitude. Public health infrastructure must be maintained to address emerging zoonotic diseases.

"The complete genomic DNA of a novel papillomavirus (PV) was isolated from a basosquamous carcinoma on the wing of an Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus). Initial short sequences of the E1 and L1 genes of this virus were retrieved by PCR with degenerate papillomavirus-specific primers, and the entire R. aegyptiacus papillomavirus type 1 (RaPV-1) DNA was then amplified by long template PCR, cloned and sequenced with a transposon insertion method. The RaPV-1 genome counts 7970 basepairs and contains the typical papillomavirus open reading frames (ORF) (E1, E2, E4, E6, E7, L1 and L2). Based on a concatenated alignment of the E1, E2, L1 and L2 open reading frames of RaPV-1 and 46 other human and animal papillomavirus type species, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed. This phylogenetic analysis shows that RaPV-1 has a close-to-root position in the papillomavirus evolutionary tree. Since RaPV-1 is only distantly related to other papillomaviruses (with maximally 50% nucleotide sequence identity across the L1 open reading frame), it cannot be assigned to one of the existing papillomavirus genera and therefore represents the first member of a novel, as yet unnamed, close-to-root papillomavirus genus. This is the first time a papillomavirus has been isolated and characterized from a member of the Chiroptera order.

"The results of laboratory examination of 20460 specimens for the diagnosis of rabies by the standard fluorescent antibody and mouse inoculation tests over a five year period are presented. Specimens were received from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the Yukon and Northwest Territories. Of those examined, 9.96% were positive. The main reservoirs of rabies were skunks, bats, and foxes. During this observation period a rabies epizootic occurred in skunks in Saskatchewan. When both tests were performed, the fluorescent antibody test was found to agree with the mouse inoculation test in over 99% of cases.

"The malaria parasites (Apicomplexa: Haemosporida) of birds are believed to have diversified across the avian host phylogeny well after the origin of most major host lineages. Although many symbionts with direct transmission codiversify with their hosts, mechanisms of species formation in vector-borne parasites, including the role of host shifting, are poorly understood. Here, we examine the hosts of sister lineages in a phylogeny of 181 putative species of malaria parasites of New World terrestrial birds to determine the role of shifts between host taxa in the formation of new parasite species. We find that host shifting, often across host genera and families, is the rule. Sympatric speciation by host shifting would require local reproductive isolation as a prerequisite to divergent selection, but this mechanism is not supported by the generalized host-biting behavior of most vectors of avian malaria parasites. Instead, the geographic distribution of individual parasite lineages in diverse hosts suggests that species formation is predominantly allopatric and involves host expansion followed by local host-pathogen coevolution and secondary sympatry, resulting in local shifting of parasite lineages across hosts.

"Environmental stress has played a major role in the evolution of living organisms (Hoffman AA, Parsons PA. 1991. Evolutionary genetics and environmental stress. Oxford: Oxford University Press; Parsons PA. 2005. Environments and evolution: interactions between stress, resource inadequacy, and energetic efficiency. Biol Rev Camb Philos Soc. 80:589-610). This is reflected by the massive and background extinctions in evolutionary time (Nevo E. 1995a. Evolution and extinction. Encyclopedia of Environmental Biology. New York: Academic Press, Inc. 1:717-745). The interaction between organism and environment is central in evolution. Extinction ensues when organisms fail to change and adapt to the constantly altering abiotic and biotic stressful environmental changes as documented in the fossil record. Extreme environmental stress causes extinction but also leads to evolutionary change and the origination of new species adapted to new environments. I will discuss a few of these global, regional, and local stresses based primarily on my own research programs. These examples will include the 1) global regional and local experiment of subterranean mammals; 2) regional experiment of fungal life in the Dead Sea; 3) evolution of wild cereals; 4) ""Evolution Canyon""; 5) human brain evolution, and 6) global warming.

"BACKGROUND: The evolutionary history of many parasites is dependent on the evolution of their hosts, leading to an association between host and parasite phylogenies. However, frequent host switches across broad phylogenetic distances may weaken this close evolutionary link, especially when vectors are involved in parasites transmission, as is the case for malaria pathogens. Several studies suggested that the evolution of the primate-infective malaria lineages may be constrained by the phylogenetic relationships of their hosts, and that lateral switches between distantly related hosts may have been occurred. However, no systematic analysis has been quantified the degree of phylogenetic association between primates and their malaria parasites. METHODS: Here phylogenetic approaches have been used to discriminate statistically between events due to co-divergence, duplication, extinction and host switches that can potentially cause historical association between Plasmodium parasites and their primate hosts. A Bayesian reconstruction of parasite phylogeny based on genetic information for six genes served as basis for the analyses, which could account for uncertainties about the evolutionary hypotheses of malaria parasites. RESULTS: Related lineages of primate-infective Plasmodium tend to infect hosts within the same taxonomic family. Different analyses testing for congruence between host and parasite phylogenies unanimously revealed a significant association between the corresponding evolutionary trees. The most important factor that resulted in this association was host switching, but depending on the parasite phylogeny considered, co-speciation and duplication may have also played some additional role. Sorting seemed to be a relatively infrequent event, and can occur only under extreme co-evolutionary scenarios. The concordance between host and parasite phylogenies is heterogeneous: while the evolution of some malaria pathogens is strongly dependent on the phylogenetic history of their primate hosts, the congruent evolution is less emphasized for other parasite lineages (e.g. for human malaria parasites). Estimation of ancestral states of host use along the phylogenetic tree of parasites revealed that lateral transfers across distantly related hosts were likely to occur in several cases. Parasites cannot infect all available hosts, and they should preferentially infect hosts that provide a similar environment for reproduction. Marginally significant evidence suggested that there might be a consistent variation within host ranges in terms of physiology. CONCLUSION: The evolution of primate malarias is constrained by the phylogenetic associations of their hosts. Some parasites can preserve a great flexibility to infect hosts across a large phylogenetic distance, thus host switching can be an important factor in mediating host ranges observed in nature. Due to this inherent flexibility and the potential exposure to various vectors, the emergence of new malaria disease in primates including humans cannot be predicted from the phylogeny of parasites.

"Observations of intraspecific variation in organelle DNA have prompted a renewed interest in the evolutionary consequences of cytoplasmically transmitted factors. Attempts to quantify the significance of cytoplasmic effects are frequently limited by the difficulty in partitioning the cause of reciprocal cross differences among a series of possibilities. In the experiment reported here the nuclear genomes of a set of six lines of Drosophila melanogaster from diverse geographic locations were replaced in a series of cytoplasms. The segregation of the SM5 balancer chromosome was scored in a factorial design, and the data allowed a partitioning of variance such that cytoplasmic effects were distinguished from maternal effects and meiotic drive. An attempt was made to avoid the confounding problem of hybrid dysgenesis by performing the entire experiment (including chromosomal extractions) in a P cytotype. Results indicated a significant contribution of cytoplasm to the variance in SM5 segregation. Error variance showed an increasing trend as the experiment proceeded, and additional tests indicated that this was due to an accumulation of chromosomal mutations. These findings are interpreted in light of the population genetic theory that addresses the maintenance of cytoplasmic polymorphism.
"
"We developed population genetic theory for organelle genes, using an infinite alleles model appropriate for molecular genetic data, and considering the effects of mutation and random drift on the frequencies of selectively neutral alleles. The effects of maternal inheritance and vegetative segregation of organelle genes are dealt with by defining new effective gene numbers, and substituting these for 2N(e) in classical theory of nuclear genes for diploid organisms. We define three different effective gene numbers. The most general is N(lambda), defined as a function of population size, number of organelle genomes per cell, and proportions of genes contributed by male and female gametes to the zygote. In many organisms, vegetative segregation of organelle genomes and intracellular random drift of organelle gene frequencies combine to produce a predominance of homoplasmic cells within individuals in the population. Then, the effective number of organelle genes is N(eo), a simple function of the numbers of males and females and of the maternal and paternal contributions to the zygote. Finally, when the paternal contribution is very small, N( eo) is closely approximated by the number of females, N( f). Then if the sex ratio is 1, the mean time to fixation or loss of new mutations is approximately two times longer for nuclear genes than for organelle genes, and gene diversity is approximately four times greater. The difference between nuclear and organelle genes disappears or is reversed in animals in which males have large harems. The differences between nuclear and organelle gene behavior caused by maternal inheritance and vegetative segregation are generally small and may be overshadowed by differences in mutation rates to neutral alleles. For monoecious organisms, the effective number of organelle genes is approximately equal to the total population size N. We also show that a population can be effectively subdivided for organelle genes at migration rates which result in panmixis for nuclear genes, especially if males migrate more than females.

"Restriction endonuclease analysis has revealed extensive mtDNA polymorphism in two species of rats, Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus. Sequence divergence values for the eight detected R. norvegicus variants range from 0.2% to 1.8% and for the eight R. rattus variants, from 0.2% to 9.6%. Three of the most closely related R. norvegicus mtDNA's appear to differ by deletions/insertions of about 4 base pairs apiece. Restriction sites for seven enzymes have been mapped for 11 of these variants. The 31 intraspecific and 41 interspecific variant sites appear to be evenly distributed on the mtDNA molecule outside of the rRNA cistrons. The location of sites present in all the DNAs suggests that the rRNA genes and possibly the light strand origin of replication may be more highly evolutionarily conserved than other parts of the molecule. The sequence divergences among the mtDNAs of animals whose geographic origins are separated by major barriers, such as oceans, were significantly greater than those among animals found within large land masses, such as the continental United States. Dendrograms (phenograms), which have been constructed to depict the relationships among the various DNAs, indicate that East Asian members of the R. rattus species are more closely related to American rats of this species than to other Asian R. rattus animals from Sri Lanka. Moreover, it appears that R. norvegicus comprises a group taxonomically distinct from any of the R. rattus subspecies.

"BACKGROUND: Some Mayan peasant-hunters across the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico still carry out a hunting ritual -Loojil Ts'oon, Loj Ts'oon or Carbine Ceremony- in which they renew the divine permission for hunting in order to continue deserving the gift of prey after a period of hunt. Thus they are granted access to game by the gods and the Lords of the Animals, particularly the spirit/evil-wind call. This paper focuses on the acts within the Loojil Ts'oon -which is performed in the X-Pichil community and surrounding area- that make it unique among the hunting rituals performed in other parts of the Peninsula. METHODS: The Loojil Ts'oon hunting ritual was observed and registered in audiovisual format in two different occasions in X-Pichil (Friday 04/29/2011 and Friday 07/29/2011). Afterwards, we delivered digital videodisks (DVD) to hunters and their families and to the j-men (the magic-medic-ritual specialist) who participated in these ceremonies. This delivery produced confidence among participants to talk more openly and in-depth about the Loojil Ts'oon, revealing symbolic, psychological, and material details previously unknown to outsiders. Qualitative information was obtained through the ethnographic method using techniques such as participant observation and guided tours. Semi-structured interviews were carried out to obtain complementary information. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: On one hand, we describe the preparation and cleansing of the ""Sip soup"", as well as its parading and distribution -delivery to the spirit/evil-wind Sip- on the streets of the community (highlingting the role of the rooster as a counter-gift). On the other hand, the cleansing of the jaws (of deer: Odocoileus virginianus, Mazama spp.; and peccaries: Tayassuidae) and their return to the Lords of Animals in the hills so that they may give these animals new life. CONCLUSIONS: By performing the Loojil Ts'oon, the act of killing an animal is legitimized. The kill transforms into an exchange to perpetuate life, in which gods and Lords of animals grant the hunter the solicited new game if he has completed his ritual duties and has not broken the prescribed hunting rules. The Loojil Ts'oon does not only represent the continuity and regeneration of animals, that is, fauna as a resource, but also of the whole hunting cycle. The hunter does so to maintain and recreate order and equilibrium in one's relationship with nature as a whole, with the rest of one's social group, and with oneself. Thus, hunting transcends the exclusively material dimension of a subsistence activity.

"Phylogenetics is used to detect past evolutionary events, from how species originated to how their ecological interactions with other species arose, which can mirror cophylogenetic patterns. Cophylogenetic reconstructions uncover past ecological relationships between taxa through inferred coevolutionary events on trees, for example, codivergence, duplication, host-switching, and loss. These events can be detected by cophylogenetic analyses based on nodes and the length and branching pattern of the phylogenetic trees of symbiotic associations, for example, host-parasite. In the past 2 decades, algorithms have been developed for cophylogetenic analyses and implemented in different software, for example, statistical congruence index and event-based methods. Based on the combination of these approaches, it is possible to integrate temporal information into cophylogenetical inference, such as estimates of lineage divergence times between 2 taxa, for example, hosts and parasites. Additionally, the advances in phylogenetic biogeography applying methods based on parametric process models and combined Bayesian approaches, can be useful for interpreting coevolutionary histories in a scenario of biogeographical area connectivity through time. This article briefly reviews the basics of parasitology and provides an overview of software packages in cophylogenetic methods. Thus, the objective here is to present a phylogenetic framework for coevolutionary studies, with special emphasis on groups of parasitic organisms. Researchers wishing to undertake phylogeny-based coevolutionary studies can use this review as a ""compass"" when ""walking"" through jungles of tangled phylogenetic trees.

"The Gansu zokor (Eospalax cansus) is a subterranean rodent species that is unique to China. These creatures inhabit underground burrows with a hypoxia environment. Metabolic energy patterns in subterranean rodents have become a recent focus of research; however, little is known about brain energy metabolism under conditions of hypoxia in this species. The mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) coordinates eukaryotic cell growth and metabolism, and its downstream targets regulate hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) under conditions of hypoxia to induce glycolysis. In this study, we compared the metabolic characteristics of hypoxia-tolerant subterranean Gansu zokors under hypoxic conditions with those of hypoxia-intolerant Sprague-Dawley rats with a similar-sized surface area. We exposed Gansu zokors and rats to hypoxia I (44 h at 10.5% O(2)) or hypoxia II (6 h at 6.5% O(2)) and then measured the transcriptional levels of mTORC1 downstream targets, the transcriptional and translational levels of glycolysis-related genes, glucose and fructose levels in plasma and brain, and the activity of key glycolysis-associated enzymes. Under hypoxia, we found that hif-1α transcription was upregulated via the mTORC1/eIF4E pathway to drive glycolysis. Furthermore, Gansu zokor brain exhibited enhanced fructose-driven glycolysis under hypoxia through increased expression of the GLUT5 fructose transporter and ketohexokinase (KHK), in addition to increased KHK enzymatic activity, and utilization of fructose; these changes did not occur in rat. However, glucose-driven glycolysis was enhanced in both Gansu zokor and rat under hypoxia II of 6.5% O(2) for 6 h. Overall, our results indicate that on the basis of glucose as the main metabolic substrate, fructose is used to accelerate the supply of energy in Gansu zokor, which mirrors the metabolic responses to hypoxia in this species.

"Lungs of the rodent species, the African giant pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus) and the Nigerian mole rat (Cryptomys foxi) were investigated. Significant morphometric differences exist between the two species. The volume of the lung per unit body mass was 2.7 times larger; the respiratory surface area 3.4 times greater; the volume of the pulmonary capillary blood 2 times more; the harmonic mean thickness of the blood-gas (tissue) barrier (τht) ~29% thinner and; the total pulmonary morphometric diffusing capacity (DLo(2)) for O(2) 2.3 times more in C. foxi. C. gambianus occupies open burrows that are ventilated with air while C. foxi lives in closed burrows. The less morphometrically specialized lungs of C. gambianus may be attributed to its much larger body mass (~6 times more) and possibly lower metabolic rate and its semifossorial life whereas the 'superior' lungs of C. foxi may largely be ascribed to the subterranean hypoxic and hypercapnic environment it occupies. Compared to other rodents species that have been investigated hitherto, the τht was mostly smaller in the lungs of the subterranean species and C. foxi has the highest mass-specific DLo(2). The fossorial- and the subterranean rodents have acquired various pulmonary structural specializations that relate to habitats occupied.

"Recent changes in soybean management like the adoption of transgenic crops and no-till farming, in addition to the expansion of cultivated areas into new virgin frontiers, are some of the hypotheses that can explain the rise of secondary pests, such as the Neotropical brown stink bug, Euschistus heros, in Brazil. To better access the risk of increased pests like E. heros and to determine probabilities for insecticide resistance spreading, it is necessary first to access the levels of the genetic diversity, how the genetic diversity is distributed, and how natural selection is acting upon the natural variation. Using the genotyping by sequencing (GBS) technique, we generated ~60,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed across the E. heros genome to answer some of those questions. The SNP data was used to investigate the pattern of genetic structure, hybridization and natural selection of this emerging pest. We found that E. heros populations presented similar levels of genetic diversity with slightly higher values at several central locations in Brazil. Our results also showed strong genetic structure separating northern and southern Brazilian regions (F(ST) = 0.22; p-value = 0.000) with a very distinct hybrid zone at the central region. The analyses also suggest the possibility that GABA channels and odorant receptors might play a role in the process of natural selection. At least one marker was associated with soybean and beans crops, but no association between allele frequency and cotton was found. We discuss the implications of these findings in the management of emerging pests in agriculture, particularly in the context of large areas of monoculture such as soybean and cotton.

"Whole blood samples were collected from 515 dogs in the practice region surrounding Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada between 2008 and 2010 and evaluated for seroprevalence of vector-borne diseases. Of 515 samples, 12 (2.3%) were positive, with 7 (1.4%) positive for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. These prevalences are higher than those previously reported for this region.

"Nine cases of fatal infection with Babesia odocoilei were confirmed in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) and elk (Cervus canadensis) housed in zoological institutions located in southern Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba, Canada between 2013 and 2016. All animals died of a hemolytic crisis. Frequent postmortem findings were extensive hemorrhage, pigmenturia, and intrahepatic cholestasis. The described ante- and postmortem signs are consistent with those of previously reported cases in the United States. Diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by polymerase chain reaction performed on DNA extracted from whole blood or frozen spleen. We propose that babesiosis is an emerging disease of cervids in multiple Canadian provinces, most likely as a result of climate change and the northward range expansion of Ixodes scapularis, the primary tick vector for B. odocoilei. The role of captive animals as sentinels for wildlife health is also highlighted.

"Brown rats are one of the most widespread urban species worldwide. Despite the nuisances they induce and their potential role as a zoonotic reservoir, knowledge on urban rat populations remains scarce. The main purpose of this study was to characterize an urban brown rat population from Chanteraines park (Hauts-de-Seine, France), with regards to haematology, population genetics, immunogenic diversity, resistance to anticoagulant rodenticides, and community of parasites. Haematological parameters were measured. Population genetics was investigated using 13 unlinked microsatellite loci. Immunogenic diversity was assessed for Mhc-Drb. Frequency of the Y139F mutation (conferring resistance to rodenticides) and two linked microsatellites were studied, concurrently with the presence of anticoagulant residues in the liver. Combination of microscopy and molecular methods were used to investigate the occurrence of 25 parasites. Statistical approaches were used to explore multiple parasite relationships and model parasite occurrence. Eighty-six rats were caught. The first haematological data for a wild urban R. norvegicus population was reported. Genetic results suggested high genetic diversity and connectivity between Chanteraines rats and surrounding population(s). We found a high prevalence (55.8%) of the mutation Y139F and presence of rodenticide residues in 47.7% of the sampled individuals. The parasite species richness was high (16). Seven potential zoonotic pathogens were identified, together with a surprisingly high diversity of Leptospira species (4). Chanteraines rat population is not closed, allowing gene flow and making eradication programs challenging, particularly because rodenticide resistance is highly prevalent. Parasitological results showed that co-infection is more a rule than an exception. Furthermore, the presence of several potential zoonotic pathogens, of which four Leptospira species, in this urban rat population raised its role in the maintenance and spread of these pathogens. Our findings should stimulate future discussions about the development of a long-term rat-control management program in Chanteraines urban park.

"BACKGROUND: Ixodes scapularis is a vector of several human pathogens in the United States, and there is geographical variation in the relative number of persons infected with these pathogens. Geographically isolated populations of I. scapularis have established or are in the process of establishing in southern Canada. Knowledge of the genetic variation within and among these populations may provide insight into their geographical origins in the United States and the potential risk of exposure of Canadians to the different pathogens carried by I. scapularis. METHODS: Part of the mitochondrial (mt) 16S ribosomal (r) RNA gene was amplified by PCR from 582 ticks collected from southern Canada, and Minnesota and Rhode Island in the United States. Sequence variation was examined in relation to the predicted secondary structure of the gene. Genetic diversity among populations was also determined. RESULTS: DNA sequence analyses revealed 52 haplotypes. Most mutational alterations in DNA sequence occurred at unpaired sites or represented partial compensatory base pair changes that maintained the stability of the secondary structure. Significant genetic variation was detected within and among populations in different geographical regions. A greater proportion of the haplotypes of I. scapularis from the Canadian Prairie Provinces were found in the Midwest of the United States than in other regions, whereas more of the haplotypes of I. scapularis from the Canadian Central and Atlantic Provinces occurred in the Northeast of the United States. Nonetheless, 58% of I. scapularis were of a haplotype that occurs in the Midwest and Northeast of the United States; thus, their geographical origins could not be determined. CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable genetic variation in the mt 16S rRNA gene of I. scapularis. There is some evidence to support the hypothesis that some lineages of I. scapularis in the Atlantic and Central Provinces of Canada may be derived from colonizing individuals originating in the Northeast of the United States, whereas those in the Prairie Provinces may be derived from individuals originating in the Midwest of the United States. However, additional genetic markers are needed to test hypotheses concerning the geographical origins of I. scapularis in Canada.

"BACKGROUND: Relaxed molecular clock models allow divergence time dating and ""relaxed phylogenetic"" inference, in which a time tree is estimated in the face of unequal rates across lineages. We present a new method for relaxing the assumption of a strict molecular clock using Markov chain Monte Carlo to implement Bayesian modeling averaging over random local molecular clocks. The new method approaches the problem of rate variation among lineages by proposing a series of local molecular clocks, each extending over a subregion of the full phylogeny. Each branch in a phylogeny (subtending a clade) is a possible location for a change of rate from one local clock to a new one. Thus, including both the global molecular clock and the unconstrained model results, there are a total of 2(2n-2) possible rate models available for averaging with 1, 2, ..., 2n - 2 different rate categories. RESULTS: We propose an efficient method to sample this model space while simultaneously estimating the phylogeny. The new method conveniently allows a direct test of the strict molecular clock, in which one rate rules them all, against a large array of alternative local molecular clock models. We illustrate the method's utility on three example data sets involving mammal, primate and influenza evolution. Finally, we explore methods to visualize the complex posterior distribution that results from inference under such models. CONCLUSIONS: The examples suggest that large sequence datasets may only require a small number of local molecular clocks to reconcile their branch lengths with a time scale. All of the analyses described here are implemented in the open access software package BEAST 1.5.4 (http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/).

"Biodiversity data are rapidly becoming available over the Internet in common formats that promote sharing and exchange. Currently, these data are somewhat problematic, primarily with regard to geographic and taxonomic accuracy, for use in ecological research, natural resources management and conservation decision-making. However, web-based georeferencing tools that utilize best practices and gazetteer databases can be employed to improve geographic data. Taxonomic data quality can be improved through web-enabled valid taxon names databases and services, as well as more efficient mechanisms to return systematic research results and taxonomic misidentification rates back to the biodiversity community. Both of these are under construction. A separate but related challenge will be developing web-based visualization and analysis tools for tracking biodiversity change. Our aim was to discuss how such tools, combined with data of enhanced quality, will help transform today's portals to raw biodiversity data into nexuses of collaborative creation and sharing of biodiversity knowledge.

"Drosophila simulans presents a large variation in copy number among various transposable elements (TEs) and among natural populations for a given element. Some elements are absent in most populations, except in one or two which have many copies. This suggests that some TEs are being awaken in some populations and are in the process of invading the species while it is colonizing the world. We present evidence for this hypothesis by a detailed analysis of copy number, structure of the copy sequences, and transcription rate of the retrotranspos-able element 412 in natural populations of the two sister species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The data support the idea that colonization of new habitats by a species is associated with mobilization of TEs, which leads to an increase in genome size of the invading species.

"Organisms use color for camouflage, sexual signaling, or as a warning sign of danger. Primates are one of the most vibrantly colored Orders of mammals. However, the genetics underlying their coat color are poorly known, limiting our ability to study molecular aspects of its evolution. The role of the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) in color evolution has been implicated in studies on rocket pocket mice (Chaetodipus intermediusi), toucans (Ramphastidae), and many domesticated animals. From these studies, we know that changes in MC1R result in a yellow/red or a brown/black morphology. Here, we investigate the evolution of MC1R in Lorisidae, a monophyletic nocturnal primate family, with some genera displaying high contrast variation in color patterns and other genera being monochromatic. Even more unique, the Lorisidae family has the only venomous primate: the slow loris (Nycticebus). Research has suggested that the contrasting coat patterns of slow lorises are aposematic signals for their venom. If so, we predict the MC1R in slow lorises will be under positive selection. In our study, we found that Lorisidae MC1R is under purifying selection (ω = 0.0912). In Lorisidae MC1R, there were a total of 75 variable nucleotides, 18 of which were nonsynonymous. Six of these nonsynonymous substitutions were found on the Perodicticus branch, which our reconstructions found to be the only member of Lorisidae that has predominantly lighter coat color; no substitutions were associated with Nycticebus. Our findings generate new insight into the genetics of pelage color and evolution among a unique group of nocturnal mammals and suggest putative underpinnings of monochromatic color evolution in the Perodicticus lineage.

"Evolutionary genetic studies have uncovered abundant evidence for genomic hotspots of phenotypic evolution, as well as biased patterns of mutations at those loci. However, the theoretical basis for this concentration of particular types of mutations at particular loci remains largely unexplored. In addition, historical contingency is known to play a major role in evolutionary trajectories, but has not been reconciled with the existence of such hotspots. For example, do the appearance of hotspots and the fixation of different types of mutations at those loci depend on the starting state and/or on the nature and direction of selection? Here, we use a computational approach to examine these questions, focusing the anthocyanin pigmentation pathway, which has been extensively studied in the context of flower color transitions. We investigate two transitions that are common in nature, the transition from blue to purple pigmentation and from purple to red pigmentation. Both sets of simulated transitions occur with a small number of mutations at just four loci and show strikingly similar peaked shapes of evolutionary trajectories, with the mutations of the largest effect occurring early but not first. Nevertheless, the types of mutations (biochemical vs. regulatory) as well as their direction and magnitude are contingent on the particular transition. These simulated color transitions largely mirror findings from natural flower color transitions, which are known to occur via repeated changes at a few hotspot loci. Still, some types of mutations observed in our simulated color evolution are rarely observed in nature, suggesting that pleiotropic effects further limit the trajectories between color phenotypes. Overall, our results indicate that the branching structure of the pathway leads to a predictable concentration of evolutionary change at the hotspot loci, but the types of mutations at these loci and their order is contingent on the evolutionary context.

"Most vertebrates host a wide variety of haematophagous parasites, which may play an important role in the transmission of vector-borne microorganisms to hosts. Surveillance is usually performed by collecting blood and/or tissue samples from vertebrate hosts. There are multiple methods to obtain samples, which can be stored for decades if properly kept. However, blood sampling is considered an invasive method and may possibly be harmful to the sampled individual. In this study, we investigated the use of ectoparasites as a tool to acquire molecular information about the presence and diversity of infectious microorganism in host populations. We tested the presence of three distinct vector-borne microorganisms in both bat blood and bat flies: Bartonella bacteria, malaria-like Polychromophilus sp. (Apicomplexa), and Trypanosoma sp. (Kinetoplastea). We detected the presence of these microorganisms both in bats and in their bat flies, with the exception of Trypanosoma sp. in South African bat flies. Additionally, we found Bartonella sp. in bat flies from one population in Spain, suggesting its presence in the host population even if not detected in bats. Bartonella and Polychromophilus infection showed the highest prevalence in both bat and bat fly populations. Single, co- and triple infections were also frequently present in both. We highlight the use of haematophagous ectoparasites to study the presence of infectious microorganism in host blood and its use as an alternative, less invasive sampling method.

"By combining well-established population genetic theory with high-throughput sequencing data from natural populations, major strides have recently been made in understanding how, why, and when vertebrate populations evolve crypsis. Here, we focus on background matching, a particular facet of crypsis that involves the ability of an organism to conceal itself through matching its color to the surrounding environment. While interesting in and of itself, the study of this phenotype has also provided fruitful population genetic insights into the interplay of strong positive selection with other evolutionary processes. Specifically, and predicated upon the findings of previous candidate gene association studies, a primary focus of this recent literature involves the realization that the inference of selection from DNA sequence data first requires a robust model of population demography in order to identify genomic regions which do not conform to neutral expectations. Moreover, these demographic estimates provide crucial information about the origin and timing of the onset of selective pressures associated with, for example, the colonization of a novel environment. Furthermore, such inference has revealed crypsis to be a particularly useful phenotype for investigating the interplay of migration and selection-with examples of gene flow constraining rates of adaptation, or alternatively providing the genetic variants that may ultimately sweep through the population. Here, we evaluate the underlying evidence, review the strengths and weaknesses of the many population genetic methodologies used in these studies, and discuss how these insights have aided our general understanding of the evolutionary process.

"Host defenses against pathogens are energetically expensive, leading ecological immunologists to postulate that they might participate in energetic trade-offs with other maintenance programs. However, the metabolic costs of immunity and the nature of physiologic trade-offs it engages are largely unknown. We report here that activation of immunity causes an energetic trade-off with the homeothermy (the stable maintenance of core temperature), resulting in hypometabolism and hypothermia. This immunity-induced physiologic trade-off was independent of sickness behaviors but required hematopoietic sensing of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Metabolomics and genome-wide expression profiling revealed that distinct metabolic programs supported entry and recovery from the energy-conserving hypometabolic state. During bacterial infections, hypometabolic states, which could be elicited by competition for energy between maintenance programs or energy restriction, promoted disease tolerance. Together, our findings suggest that energy-conserving hypometabolic states, such as dormancy, might have evolved as a mechanism of tissue tolerance.

"MOTIVATION: Identifying variants, both discrete and continuous, that are associated with quantitative traits, or QTs, is the primary focus of quantitative genetics. Most current methods are limited to identifying mean effects, or associations between genotype or covariates and the mean value of a quantitative trait. It is possible, however, that a variant may affect the variance of the quantitative trait in lieu of, or in addition to, affecting the trait mean. Here, we develop a general methodology to identify covariates with variance effects on a quantitative trait using a Bayesian heteroskedastic linear regression model (BTH). We compare BTH with existing methods to detect variance effects across a large range of simulations drawn from scenarios common to the analysis of quantitative traits. RESULTS: We find that BTH and a double generalized linear model (dglm) outperform classical tests used for detecting variance effects in recent genomic studies. We show BTH and dglm are less likely to generate spurious discoveries through simulations and application to identifying methylation variance QTs and expression variance QTs. We identify four variance effects of sex in the Cardiovascular and Pharmacogenetics study. Our work is the first to offer a comprehensive view of variance identifying methodology. We identify shortcomings in previously used methodology and provide a more conservative and robust alternative. We extend variance effect analysis to a wide array of covariates that enables a new statistical dimension in the study of sex and age specific quantitative trait effects.

"The role of parasites in shaping melanin-based colour polymorphism, and the consequences of colour polymorphism for disease resistance, remain debated. Here we review recent evidence of the links between melanin-based coloration and the behavioural and immunological defences of vertebrates against their parasites. First we propose that (1) differences between colour morphs can result in variable exposure to parasites, either directly (certain colours might be more or less attractive to parasites) or indirectly (variations in behaviour and encounter probability). Once infected, we propose that (2) immune variation between differently coloured individuals might result in different abilities to cope with parasite infection. We then discuss (3) how these different abilities could translate into variable sexual and natural selection in environments varying in parasite pressure. Finally, we address (4) the potential role of parasites in the maintenance of melanin-based colour polymorphism, especially in the context of global change and multiple stressors in human-altered environments. Because global change will probably affect both coloration and the spread of parasitic diseases in the decades to come, future studies should take into account melanin-based coloration to better predict the evolutionary responses of animals to changing disease risk in human-altered environments.

"Almost 30 y ago, the field of intraspecific phylogeography laid the foundation for spatially explicit and genealogically informed studies of population divergence. With new methods and markers, the focus in phylogeography shifted to previously unrecognized geographic genetic variation, thus reducing the attention paid to phenotypic variation in those same diverging lineages. Although phenotypic differences among lineages once provided the main data for studies of evolutionary change, the mechanisms shaping phenotypic differentiation and their integration with intraspecific genetic structure have been underexplored in phylogeographic studies. However, phenotypes are targets of selection and play important roles in species performance, recognition, and diversification. Here, we focus on three questions. First, how can phenotypes elucidate mechanisms underlying concordant or idiosyncratic responses of vertebrate species evolving in shared landscapes? Second, what mechanisms underlie the concordance or discordance of phenotypic and phylogeographic differentiation? Third, how can phylogeography contribute to our understanding of functional phenotypic evolution? We demonstrate that the integration of phenotypic data extends the reach of phylogeography to explain the origin and maintenance of biodiversity. Finally, we stress the importance of natural history collections as sources of high-quality phenotypic data that span temporal and spatial axes.

"The western United States is home to numerous narrowly endemic harvestman taxa (Arachnida, Opiliones), including members of the genus Sitalcina Banks, 1911. Sitalcina is comprised of three species groups, including the monospecific Sitalcina californica and Sitalcina lobata groups, and the Sitalcina sura group with eight described species. All species in the Sitalcina sura group have very small geographic distributions, with group members distributed like disjunct ""beads on a string"" from Monterey south to southern California and southeast to the sky-island mountain ranges of southern Arizona. Here, molecular phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses were conducted for all described species in the Sitalcina sura group, plus several newly discovered populations. Species trees were reconstructed using multispecies coalescent methods implemented in *BEAST, and species delimitation was accomplished using Bayes Factor Delimitation (BFD). Based on quantitative species delimitation results supported by consideration of morphological characters, two new species (Sitalcina oasiensis sp. n., Sitalcina ubicki sp. n.) are described. We also provide a description of the previously unknown male of Sitalcina borregoensis Briggs, 1968. Molecular phylogenetic evidence strongly supports distinctive desert versus coastal clades, with desert canyon taxa from southern California more closely related to Arizona taxa than to geographically proximate California coastal taxa. We hypothesize that southern ancestry and plate tectonics have played a role in the diversification history of this animal lineage, similar to sclerophyllous plant taxa of the Madro-Tertiary Geoflora. Molecular clock analyses for the Sitalcina sura group are generally consistent with these hypotheses. We also propose that additional Sitalcina species await discovery in the desert canyons of southern California and northern Baja, and the mountains of northwestern mainland Mexico.

"BACKGROUND: When populations evolve under disparate environmental conditions, they experience different selective pressures that shape patterns of sequence evolution and gene expression. These may be manifested in genetic and phenotypic differences such as a diverse immunogenetic repertoire in species from tropical latitudes that have greater and/or different parasite burdens than more temperate species. To test this idea, we compared the transcriptomes of one tropical species (Heteromys desmarestianus) and two species from temperate latitudes (Dipodomys spectabilis and Chaetodipus baileyi) from the Heteromyidae. We did so in a search for positive selection on sequences and/or differential expression, while controlling for phylogenetic history in our choice of species. RESULTS: We identified 127,812 contigs and annotated 34,878 of these, identifying immune genes associated with interleukins, cytokines, and the production of mast cells. We identified 632 genes that were upregulated in H. desmarestianus (8.7% of genes tested) and 492 (6.7%) that were downregulated. Gene ontology terms including ""immune response"" were associated with 31 (4.9%) of the 632 upregulated genes. We found preliminary evidence for positive selection on three genes (Palmitoyltransferase ZDHHC5 Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 N, Krueppel-like factor 10, and Spindle and kinetochore-associated protein 1) along the H. desmarestianus lineage. CONCLUSIONS: Overall our findings pinpoint genes in species from disparate environments that are on different evolutionary trajectories in terms of expression levels and/or nucleotide sequence. Our data indicate there are significant differences in the expression of genes among the spleen transcriptomes of these species and that a number of these differentially expressed genes do not show the same pattern of differential expression in another tissue type. This points to the possibility of expression differences between these species specific to the spleen transcriptome.

"BACKGROUND: Disease risk maps are important tools that help ascertain the likelihood of exposure to specific infectious agents. Understanding how climate change may affect the suitability of habitats for ticks will improve the accuracy of risk maps of tick-borne pathogen transmission in humans and domestic animal populations. Lyme disease (LD) is the most prevalent arthropod borne disease in the US and Europe. The bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi causes LD and it is transmitted to humans and other mammalian hosts through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. LD risk maps in the transboundary region between the U.S. and Mexico are lacking. Moreover, none of the published studies that evaluated the effect of climate change in the spatial and temporal distribution of I. scapularis have focused on this region. METHODS: The area of study included Texas and a portion of northeast Mexico. This area is referred herein as the Texas-Mexico transboundary region. Tick samples were obtained from various vertebrate hosts in the region under study. Ticks identified as I. scapularis were processed to obtain DNA and to determine if they were infected with B. burgdorferi using PCR. A maximum entropy approach (MAXENT) was used to forecast the present and future (2050) distribution of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region by correlating geographic data with climatic variables. RESULTS: Of the 1235 tick samples collected, 109 were identified as I. scapularis. Infection with B. burgdorferi was detected in 45% of the I. scapularis ticks collected. The model presented here indicates a wide distribution for I. scapularis, with higher probability of occurrence along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Results of the modeling approach applied predict that habitat suitable for the distribution of I. scapularis in the Texas-Mexico transboundary region will remain relatively stable until 2050. CONCLUSIONS: The Texas-Mexico transboundary region appears to be part of a continuum in the pathogenic landscape of LD. Forecasting based on climate trends provides a tool to adapt strategies in the near future to mitigate the impact of LD related to its distribution and risk for transmission to human populations in the Mexico-US transboundary region.

"University Modeling Instruction (UMI) is an approach to curriculum and pedagogy that focuses instruction on engaging students in building, validating, and deploying scientific models. Modeling Instruction has been successfully implemented in both high school and university physics courses. Studies within the physics education research (PER) community have identified UMI's positive impacts on learning gains, equity, attitudinal shifts, and self-efficacy. While the success of this pedagogical approach has been recognized within the physics community, the use of models and modeling practices is still being developed for biology. Drawing from the existing research on UMI in physics, we describe the theoretical foundations of UMI and how UMI can be adapted to include an emphasis on models and modeling for undergraduate introductory biology courses. In particular, we discuss our ongoing work to develop a framework for the first semester of a two-semester introductory biology course sequence by identifying the essential basic models for an introductory biology course sequence.

"BACKGROUND: Because of complex interactions of climate variables at the levels of the pathogen, vector, and host, the potential influence of climate change on vector-borne and zoonotic diseases (VBZDs) is poorly understood and difficult to predict. Climate effects on the nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases are especially obscure and have received scant treatment. OBJECTIVE: We described known and potential effects of climate change on VBZDs and proposed specific studies to increase our understanding of these effects. The nonvector-borne zoonotic diseases have received scant treatment and are emphasized in this paper. DATA SOURCES AND SYNTHESIS: We used a review of the existing literature and extrapolations from observations of short-term climate variation to suggest potential impacts of climate change on VBZDs. Using public health priorities on climate change, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we developed six specific goals for increasing understanding of the interaction between climate and VBZDs and for improving capacity for predicting climate change effects on incidence and distribution of VBZDs. CONCLUSIONS: Climate change may affect the incidence of VBZDs through its effect on four principal characteristics of host and vector populations that relate to pathogen transmission to humans: geographic distribution, population density, prevalence of infection by zoonotic pathogens, and the pathogen load in individual hosts and vectors. These mechanisms may interact with each other and with other factors such as anthropogenic disturbance to produce varying effects on pathogen transmission within host and vector populations and to humans. Because climate change effects on most VBZDs act through wildlife hosts and vectors, understanding these effects will require multidisciplinary teams to conduct and interpret ecosystem-based studies of VBZD pathogens in host and vector populations and to identify the hosts, vectors, and pathogens with the greatest potential to affect human populations under climate change scenarios.

"A complete understanding of the role of natural selection in driving evolutionary change requires accurate estimates of the strength of selection acting in the wild. Accordingly, several approaches using a variety of data-including patterns of DNA variability, spatial and temporal changes in allele frequencies, and fitness estimates-have been developed to identify and quantify selection on both genotypes and phenotypes. Here, we review these approaches, drawing on both recent and classic examples to illustrate their utility and limitations. We then argue that by combining estimates of selection at multiple levels-from individual mutations to phenotypes-and at multiple timescales-from ecological to evolutionary-with experiments that demonstrate why traits are under selection, we can gain a much more complete picture of the adaptive process.

"Recent studies of developmental biology have shown that the genes controlling phenotypic characters expressed in the early stage of development are highly conserved and that recent evolutionary changes have occurred primarily in the characters expressed in later stages of development. Even the genes controlling the latter characters are generally conserved, but there is a large component of neutral or nearly neutral genetic variation within and between closely related species. Phenotypic evolution occurs primarily by mutation of genes that interact with one another in the developmental process. The enormous amount of phenotypic diversity among different phyla or classes of organisms is a product of accumulation of novel mutations and their conservation that have facilitated adaptation to different environments. Novel mutations may be incorporated into the genome by natural selection (elimination of preexisting genotypes) or by random processes such as genetic and genomic drift. However, once the mutations are incorporated into the genome, they may generate developmental constraints that will affect the future direction of phenotypic evolution. It appears that the driving force of phenotypic evolution is mutation, and natural selection is of secondary importance.

"Polintons (also known as Mavericks) were initially identified as a widespread class of eukaryotic transposons named for their hallmark type B DNA polymerase and retrovirus-like integrase genes. It has since been recognized that many polintons encode possible capsid proteins and viral genome-packaging ATPases similar to those of a diverse range of double-stranded DNA viruses. This supports the inference that at least some polintons are actually viruses capable of cell-to-cell spread. At present, there are no polinton-associated capsid protein genes annotated in public sequence databases. To rectify this deficiency, we used a data-mining approach to investigate the distribution and gene content of polinton-like elements and related DNA viruses in animal genomic and metagenomic sequence datasets. The results define a discrete family-like clade of viruses with two genus-level divisions. We propose the family name Adintoviridae, connoting similarities to adenovirus virion proteins and the presence of a retrovirus-like integrase gene. Although adintovirus-class PolB sequences were detected in datasets for fungi and various unicellular eukaryotes, sequences resembling adintovirus virion proteins and accessory genes appear to be restricted to animals. Degraded adintovirus sequences are endogenized into the germlines of a wide range of animals, including humans.

"Urban development can fragment and degrade remnant habitat. Such habitat alterations can have profound impacts on wildlife, including effects on population density, parasite infection status, parasite prevalence, and body condition. We investigated the influence of urbanization on populations of Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami) and their parasites. We predicted that urban development would lead to reduced abundance, increased parasite prevalence in urban populations, increased probability of parasite infection for individual animals, and decreased body condition of kangaroo rats in urban versus wildland areas. We live trapped kangaroo rats at 5 urban and 5 wildland sites in and around Las Cruces, NM, USA from 2013 to 2015, collected fecal samples from 209 kangaroo rats, and detected endoparasites using fecal flotation and molecular barcoding. Seven parasite species were detected, although only two parasitic worms, Mastophorus dipodomis and Pterygodermatites dipodomis, occurred frequently enough to allow for statistical analysis. We found no effects of urbanization on population density or probability of parasite infection. However, wildland animals infected with P. dipodomis had lower body condition scores than infected animals in urban areas or uninfected animals in either habitat. Our results suggest that urban environments may buffer Merriam's kangaroo rats from the detrimental impacts to body condition that P. dipodomis infections can cause.

"Whether animals have emotions was historically a long-lasting question but, today, nobody disputes that they do. However, how to assess them and how to guarantee animals their welfare have become important research topics in the last 20 years. Infrared thermography (IRT) is a method to record the electromagnetic radiation emitted by bodies. It can indirectly assess sympathetic and parasympathetic activity via the modification of temperature of different body areas, caused by different phenomena such as stress-induced hyperthermia or variation in blood flow. Compared to other emotional activation assessment methods, IRT has the advantage of being noninvasive, allowing use without the risk of influencing animals' behavior or physiological responses. This review describes general principles of IRT functioning, as well as its applications in studies regarding emotional reactions of domestic animals, with a brief section dedicated to the experiments on wildlife; it analyzes potentialities and possible flaws, confronting the results obtained in different taxa, and discusses further opportunities for IRT in studies about animal emotions.

"BACKGROUND: Pathogens are key components in natural and agricultural plant systems. There is evidence of evolutionary changes in disease susceptibility as a consequence of climate change, but we know little about the underlying genetic basis of this evolution. To address this, we took advantage of a historical seed collection of a Brassica rapa population, which we previously demonstrated evolved an increase in disease susceptibility to a necrotrophic fungal pathogen following a drought. RESULTS: Previously, we combined a resurrection experiment with genome-wide sequencing of 124 pooled ancestral and descendant plants. Here, using these previously generated sequence data (Franks et al. in Mol Ecol 25(15):3622-3631, 2016), we show that well-characterized necrotrophic fungal pathogen response (NFPR) genes have evolved, as indicated by changes in allele frequency, between ancestors and descendants, with several of them identified as extreme F(ST) outliers. The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway in particular seems to underlie the evolution of disease susceptibility, in addition to its well characterized role in plastic disease response. We identify a list of 260 genes that are both NFPR genes and are differentially expressed in response to drought, based on publicly available data. We present evidence that five of these genes evolved between ancestors and descendants, suggesting that the drought acted as the evolutionary driver, and that the accompanying increase in disease susceptibility may have been a consequence of genetic pleiotropy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that for this population, standing variation in NFPR genes is affected by natural selection related to climate change. Our results reveal potentially important candidates that may underlie trait evolution in both crops and natural systems. Additionally, this trade-off between adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses is an example of how climate change can have diverse and unexpected consequences.

"Many animals engage in a behavior known as natal philopatry, where after sexual maturity they return to their own birthplaces for subsequent reproduction. There are many proposed ultimate factors that may underlie the evolution of natal philopatry, such as genetic optimization, suitable living conditions, and friendly neighbors, which can improve the survival rates of offspring. However, here we propose that a key factor that has been overlooked could be the colonization of gut microbiota during early life and the effects these microorganisms have on host performance and fitness. In addition to the bacteria transmitted from the mother to offspring, microbes from the surrounding environment also account for a large proportion of the developing gut microbiome. While it was long believed that microbial species all have global distributions, we now know that there are substantial geographic differences and dispersal limitations to environmental microbes. The establishment of gut microbiota during early life has enormous impacts on animal development, including energy metabolism, training of the immune system, and cognitive development. Moreover, these microbial effects scale to influence animal performance and fitness, raising the possibility for natural selection to act on the integrated combination of gut microbial communities and host genetics (i.e. the holobiont). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a hypothesis: that optimization of host-microbe-environment interactions represents a potentially important yet overlooked reason for natal philopatry. Microbiota obtained by natal philopatry could help animals adapt to the environment and improve the survival rates of their young. We propose future directions to test these ideas, and the implications that this hypothesis has for our understanding of host-microbe interactions.

"The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The pandemic apparently started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since affected many countries worldwide, turning into a major global threat. Chinese researchers reported that SARS-CoV-2 could be classified into two major variants. They suggest that investigating the variations and characteristics of these variants might help assess risks and develop better treatment and prevention strategies. The two variants were named L-type and S-type, in which L-type was prevailed in an initial outbreak in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei Province, and S-type was phylogenetically older than L-type and less prevalent at an early stage, but with a later increase in frequency in Wuhan. There were 149 mutations in 103 sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, 83 of which were nonsynonymous, leading to alteration in the amino acid sequence of proteins. Much effort is currently being devoted to elucidate whether or not these mutations affect viral transmissibility and virulence. In this review, we summarize the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of virus evolution and discuss the significance of the gene alterations in infections.

"BACKGROUND: Repetitive DNA sequences, including transposable elements (TEs) and tandemly repeated satellite DNA (satDNAs), collectively called the ""repeatome"", are found in high proportion in organisms across the Tree of Life. Grasshoppers have large genomes, averaging 9 Gb, that contain a high proportion of repetitive DNA, which has hampered progress in assembling reference genomes. Here we combined linked-read genomics with transcriptomics to assemble, characterize, and compare the structure of repetitive DNA sequences in four chromosomal races of the morabine grasshopper Vandiemenella viatica species complex and determine their contribution to genome evolution. RESULTS: We obtained linked-read genome assemblies of 2.73-3.27 Gb from estimated genome sizes of 4.26-5.07 Gb DNA per haploid genome of the four chromosomal races of V. viatica. These constitute the third largest insect genomes assembled so far. Combining complementary annotation tools and manual curation, we found a large diversity of TEs and satDNAs, constituting 66 to 75% per genome assembly. A comparison of sequence divergence within the TE classes revealed massive accumulation of recent TEs in all four races (314-463 Mb per assembly), indicating that their large genome sizes are likely due to similar rates of TE accumulation. Transcriptome sequencing showed more biased TE expression in reproductive tissues than somatic tissues, implying permissive transcription in gametogenesis. Out of 129 satDNA families, 102 satDNA families were shared among the four chromosomal races, which likely represent a diversity of satDNA families in the ancestor of the V. viatica chromosomal races. Notably, 50 of these shared satDNA families underwent differential proliferation since the recent diversification of the V. viatica species complex. CONCLUSION: This in-depth annotation of the repeatome in morabine grasshoppers provided new insights into the genome evolution of Orthoptera. Our TEs analysis revealed a massive recent accumulation of TEs equivalent to the size of entire Drosophila genomes, which likely explains the large genome sizes in grasshoppers. Despite an overall high similarity of the TE and satDNA diversity between races, the patterns of TE expression and satDNA proliferation suggest rapid evolution of grasshopper genomes on recent timescales.

"Studying the evolutionary diversification of mammalian antiviral defenses is of main importance to better understand our innate immune repertoire. The small HERC proteins are part of a multigene family, including HERC5 and HERC6, which have probably diversified through complex evolutionary history in mammals. Here, we performed mammalian-wide phylogenetic and genomic analyses of HERC5 and HERC6, using 83 orthologous sequences from bats, rodents, primates, artiodactyls, and carnivores-the top five representative groups of mammalian evolution. We found that HERC5 has been under weak and differential positive selection in mammals, with only primate HERC5 showing evidences of pathogen-driven selection. In contrast, HERC6 has been under strong and recurrent adaptive evolution in mammals, suggesting past and widespread genetic arms-races with viral pathogens. Importantly, the rapid evolution of mammalian HERC6 spacer domain suggests that it might be a host-pathogen interface, targeting viral proteins and/or being the target of virus antagonists. Finally, we identified a HERC5/6 chimeric gene that arose from independent duplication in rodent and bat lineages and encodes for a conserved HERC5 N-terminal domain and divergent HERC6 spacer and HECT domains. This duplicated chimeric gene highlights adaptations that potentially contribute to rodent and bat immunity. Our findings open new research avenues on the functions of HERC6 and HERC5/6 in mammals, and on their implication in antiviral innate immunity.

"The molecular function of a protein relies on its structure. Understanding how variants alter structure and function in multidomain proteins is key to elucidate the generation of a pathological phenotype. However, one may fall into the logical bias of assessing protein damage only based on the variants that are visible (survivorship bias), which can lead to partial conclusions. This is the case of PNKP, an important nuclear and mitochondrial DNA repair enzyme with both kinase and phosphatase function. Most variants in PNKP are confined to the kinase domain, leading to a pathological spectrum of three apparently distinct clinical entities. Since proteins and domains may have a different tolerability to variation, we evaluated whether variants in PNKP are under survivorship bias. Here, we provide the evidence that supports a higher tolerance in the kinase domain even when all variants reported are deleterious. Instead, the phosphatase domain is less tolerant due to its lower variant rates, a higher degree of sequence conservation, lower dN/dS ratios, and the presence of more disease-propensity hotspots. Together, our results support previous experimental evidence that demonstrated that the phosphatase domain is functionally more necessary and relevant for DNA repair, especially in the context of the development of the central nervous system. Finally, we propose the term ""Wald's domain"" for future studies analyzing the possible survivorship bias in multidomain proteins.

"Almost one third of Earth's land surface is arid, with deserts alone covering more than 46 million square kilometres. Nearly 2.1 billion people inhabit deserts or drylands and these regions are also home to a great diversity of plant and animal species including many that are unique to them. Aridity is a multifaceted environmental stress combining a lack of water with limited food availability and typically extremes of temperature, impacting animal species across the planet from polar cold valleys, to Andean deserts and the Sahara. These harsh environments are also home to diverse microbial communities, demonstrating the ability of bacteria, fungi and archaea to settle and live in some of the toughest locations known. We now understand that these microbial ecosystems i.e. microbiotas, the sum total of microbial life across and within an environment, interact across both the environment, and the macroscopic organisms residing in these arid environments. Although multiple studies have explored these microbial communities in different arid environments, few studies have examined the microbiota of animals which are themselves arid-adapted. Here we aim to review the interactions between arid environments and the microbial communities which inhabit them, covering hot and cold deserts, the challenges these environments pose and some issues arising from limitations in the field. We also consider the work carried out on arid-adapted animal microbiotas, to investigate if any shared patterns or trends exist, whether between organisms or between the animals and the wider arid environment microbial communities. We determine if there are any patterns across studies potentially demonstrating a general impact of aridity on animal-associated microbiomes or benefits from aridity-adapted microbiomes for animals. In the context of increasing desertification and climate change it is important to understand the connections between the three pillars of microbiome, host genome and environment.

"Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that binding to ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we propose a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated for the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlated closely with the effectiveness of animal infection as determined by multiple experimental data sets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggest a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggests a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation, but also, more importantly, it proposes a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.

"The article is presenting a bioinformatics based method predicting susceptibility for SARS-CoV-2 infection in domestic and wildlife animals. Recently, there were reports of cats and ferrets, dogs, minks, golden hamster, rhesus monkeys, tigers, and lions testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA which indicated for the possible interspecies viral transmission. Our method successfully predicted the susceptibility of these animals for contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. This method can be used as a screening tool for guiding viral RNA testing for domestic and wildlife animals at risk of getting COVID-19. We provide a list of the animals at risk of developing COVID-19 based on the susceptibility score.

"Habitat loss and fragmentation due to urbanization can negatively affect metapopulation persistence when gene flow among populations is reduced and population sizes decrease. Inference of patterns and processes of population connectivity derived from spatial genetic analysis has proven invaluable for conservation and management. However, a more complete account of population dynamics may be obtained by combining spatial and temporal sampling. We, therefore, performed a genetic study on European stag beetle (Lucanus cervus L.) populations in a suburban context using samples collected in three locations and during the period 2002-2016. The sampling area has seen recent landscape changes which resulted in population declines. Through the use of a suite of F (ST), clustering analysis, individual assignment, and relatedness analysis, we assessed fine scale spatiotemporal genetic variation within and among habitat patches using 283 individuals successfully genotyped at 17 microsatellites. Our findings suggested the three locations to hold demographically independent populations, at least over time scales of relevance to conservation, though with higher levels of gene flow in the past. Contrary to expectation from tagging studies, dispersal appeared to be mainly female-biased. Although the life cycle of stag beetle suggests its generations to be discrete, no clear temporal structure was identified, which could be attributed to the varying duration of larval development. Since population bottlenecks were detected and estimates of effective number of breeders were low, conservation actions are eminent which should include the establishment of suitable dead wood for oviposition on both local and regional scales to increase (re)colonization success and connectivity among current populations.

"In contrast to fossorial and above-ground organisms, subterranean species have adapted to the extreme stresses of living underground. We analyzed the predicted protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of all gene products, including those of stress-response genes, among nine subterranean, ten fossorial, and 13 aboveground species. We considered 10,314 unique orthologous protein families and constructed 5,879,879 PPIs in all organisms using ChiPPI. We found strong association between PPI network modulation and adaptation to specific habitats, noting that mutations in genes and changes in protein sequences were not linked directly with niche adaptation in the organisms sampled. Thus, orthologous hypoxia, heat-shock, and circadian clock proteins were found to cluster according to habitat, based on PPIs rather than on sequence similarities. Curiously, ""ordered"" domains were preserved in aboveground species, while ""disordered"" domains were conserved in subterranean organisms, and confirmed for proteins in DistProt database. Furthermore, proteins with disordered regions were found to adopt significantly less optimal codon usage in subterranean species than in fossorial and above-ground species. These findings reveal design principles of protein networks by means of alterations in protein domains, thus providing insight into deep mechanisms of evolutionary adaptation, generally, and particularly of species to underground living and other confined habitats.

"Efforts to conserve marine mammals are often constrained by uncertainty over their population history. Here, we examine the evolutionary history of a harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) population in the Moray Firth, northeast Scotland using genetic tools and microsatellite markers to explore population change. Previous fine-scale analysis of UK harbour seal populations revealed three clusters in the UK, with a northeastern cluster that included our Moray Firth study population. Our analysis revealed that the Moray Firth cluster is an independent genetic group, with similar levels of genetic diversity across each of the localities sampled. These samples were used to assess historic abundance and demographic events in the Moray Firth population. Estimates of current genetic diversity and effective population size were low, but the results indicated that this population has remained at broadly similar levels following the population bottleneck that occurred after post-glacial recolonization of the area.

"Hosts are often infested by multiple parasite species, but it is often unclear whether patterns of parasite co-occurrence are driven by parasite habitat requirements or parasite species interactions. Using data on infestation patterns of ectoparasitic arthropods (fleas, trombiculid mites, cuterebrid botflies) from deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), we analyzed species associations using joint species distribution modelling. We also experimentally removed a flea (Orchopeas leucopus) from a subset of deer mice to examine the effect on other common ectoparasite species. We found that the mite (Neotrombicula microti) and botfly (Cuterebra sp.) had a negative relationship that is likely a true biotic species interaction. The flea had a negative association with the mite and a positive association with the botfly species, both of which appeared to be influenced by host traits or parasite life-history traits. Furthermore, experimental removal of the flea did not have a significant effect on ectoparasite prevalence of another species. Overall, these findings suggest that complex parasite species associations can be present among multiple parasite taxa, and that aggregation is not always the rule for ectoparasite communities of small mammals.

"The stress-induced c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) controls microtubule dynamics by enhancing both microtubule growth and rescues. Here, we show that upon cell stress, JNK directly phosphorylates the microtubule rescue factor CLIP-170 in its microtubule-binding domain to increase its rescue-promoting activity. Phosphomimetic versions of CLIP-170 enhance its ability to promote rescue events in vitro and in cells. Furthermore, while phosphomimetic mutations do not alter CLIP-170's capability to form comets at growing microtubule ends, both phosphomimetic mutations and JNK activation increase the occurrence of CLIP-170 remnants on the microtubule lattice at the rear of comets. As the CLIP-170 remnants, which are potential sites of microtubule rescue, display a shorter lifetime when CLIP-170 is phosphorylated, we propose that instead of acting at the time of rescue occurrence, CLIP-170 would rather contribute in preparing the microtubule lattice for future rescues at these predetermined sites.

"Elastin-derived peptides are released from the extracellular matrix remodeling by numerous proteases and seem to regulate many biological processes, notably cancer progression. The canonical elastin peptide is VGVAPG, which harbors the XGXXPG consensus pattern, allowing interaction with the elastin receptor complex located at the surface of cells. Besides these elastokines, another class of peptides has been identified. This group of bioactive elastin peptides presents the XGXPGXGXG consensus sequence, but the reason for their bioactivity remains unexplained. To better understand their nature and structure-function relationships, herein we searched the current databases for this nonapeptide motif and observed that the XGXPGXGXG elastin peptides define a specific group of tandemly repeated patterns. Further, we focused on four tandemly repeated human elastin nonapeptides, i.e., AGIPGLGVG, VGVPGLGVG, AGVPGLGVG, and AGVPGFGAG. These peptides were analyzed by means of optical spectroscopies and molecular dynamics. Ultraviolet-circular dichroism and Raman spectra are consistent with a mixture of β-turn, β-strand, and random-chain secondary elements in aqueous media. Quantitative analysis of their conformations suggested that turns corresponded to half of the total population of structural elements, whereas the remaining half were equally distributed between β-strand and unordered chains. These distributions were confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations. Altogether, our data suggest that these highly dynamic peptides harbor a type II β-turn located in their central part. We hypothesize that this structural element could explain their specific bioactivity.

"The histamine H(4) receptor, belonging to the family of G-protein coupled receptors, is an increasingly attractive drug target. It plays an indispensable role in many cellular pathways, and numerous H(4)R ligands are being studied for the treatment of several inflammatory, allergic, and autoimmune disorders, including pulmonary fibrosis. Activation of H(4)R is involved in cytokine production and mediates mast cell activation and eosinophil chemotaxis. The importance of this receptor has also been shown in inflammatory models: peritonitis, respiratory tract inflammation, colitis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies suggest that H(4)R acts as a modulator in cancer, neuropathic pain, vestibular disorders, and type-2 diabetes, however, its role is still not fully understood.

"The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2019/20 is the fourth in this series of biennial publications. The Concise Guide provides concise overviews of the key properties of nearly 1800 human drug targets with an emphasis on selective pharmacology (where available), plus links to the open access knowledgebase source of drug targets and their ligands (www.guidetopharmacology.org), which provides more detailed views of target and ligand properties. Although the Concise Guide represents approximately 400 pages, the material presented is substantially reduced compared to information and links presented on the website. It provides a permanent, citable, point-in-time record that will survive database updates. The full contents of this section can be found at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.14748. G protein-coupled receptors are one of the six major pharmacological targets into which the Guide is divided, with the others being: ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, catalytic receptors, enzymes and transporters. These are presented with nomenclature guidance and summary information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside key references and suggestions for further reading. The landscape format of the Concise Guide is designed to facilitate comparison of related targets from material contemporary to mid-2019, and supersedes data presented in the 2017/18, 2015/16 and 2013/14 Concise Guides and previous Guides to Receptors and Channels. It is produced in close conjunction with the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (NC-IUPHAR), therefore, providing official IUPHAR classification and nomenclature for human drug targets, where appropriate.

"Evolution of cellular innate immune genes in response to viral threats represents a rich area of study for understanding complex events that shape mammalian genomes. One of these genes, TRIM5, is a retroviral restriction factor that mediates a post-entry block to infection. Previous studies on the genomic cluster that contains TRIM5 identified different patterns of gene amplification and the independent birth of CypA gene fusions in various primate species. However, the evolution of Trim5 in the largest order of mammals, Rodentia, remains poorly characterized. Here, we present an expansive phylogenetic and genomic analysis of the Trim5 cluster in rodents. Our findings reveal substantial evolutionary changes including gene amplifications, rearrangements, loss and fusion. We describe the first independent evolution of TrimCyp fusion genes in rodents. We show that the TrimCyp gene found in some Peromyscus species was acquired about 2 million years ago. When ectopically expressed, the P. maniculatus TRIMCyp shows anti-retroviral activity that is reversed by cyclosporine, but it does not activate Nf-κB or AP-1 promoters, unlike the primate TRIMCyps. These results describe a complex pattern of differential gene amplification in the Trim5 cluster of rodents and identify the first functional TrimCyp fusion gene outside of primates and tree shrews.

"The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) of plant invasion asserts that natural enemies limit populations of invasive plants more strongly in native ranges than in non-native ranges. Despite considerable empirical attention, few studies have directly tested this idea, especially with respect to generalist herbivores. This knowledge gap is important because escaping the effects of generalists is a critical aspect of the ERH that may help explain successful plant invasions. Here, we used consumer exclosures and seed addition experiments to contrast the effects of granivorous rodents (an important guild of generalists) on the establishment of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) in western Asia, where cheatgrass is native, versus the Great Basin Desert, USA, where cheatgrass is exotic and highly invasive. Consistent with the ERH, rodent foraging reduced cheatgrass establishment by nearly 60% in western Asia but had no effect in the Great Basin. This main result corresponded with a region-specific foraging pattern: rodents in the Great Basin but not western Asia generally avoided seeds from cheatgrass relative to seeds from native competitors. Our results suggest that enemy release from the effects of an important guild of generalists may contribute to the explosive success of cheatgrass in the Great Basin. These findings corroborate classic theory on enemy release and expand our understanding of how generalists can influence the trajectory of exotic plant invasions.

"Nucleic acids from bacteria or viruses induce potent immune responses in infected cells(1-4). The detection of pathogen-derived nucleic acids is a central strategy by which the host senses infection and initiates protective immune responses(5,6). Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a double-stranded DNA sensor(7,8). It catalyses the synthesis of cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP)(9-12), which stimulates the induction of type I interferons through the STING-TBK1-IRF-3 signalling axis(13-15). STING oligomerizes after binding of cGAMP, leading to the recruitment and activation of the TBK1 kinase(8,16). The IRF-3 transcription factor is then recruited to the signalling complex and activated by TBK1(8,17-20). Phosphorylated IRF-3 translocates to the nucleus and initiates the expression of type I interferons(21). However, the precise mechanisms that govern activation of STING by cGAMP and subsequent activation of TBK1 by STING remain unclear. Here we show that a conserved PLPLRT/SD motif within the C-terminal tail of STING mediates the recruitment and activation of TBK1. Crystal structures of TBK1 bound to STING reveal that the PLPLRT/SD motif binds to the dimer interface of TBK1. Cell-based studies confirm that the direct interaction between TBK1 and STING is essential for induction of IFNβ after cGAMP stimulation. Moreover, we show that full-length STING oligomerizes after it binds cGAMP, and highlight this as an essential step in the activation of STING-mediated signalling. These findings provide a structural basis for the development of STING agonists and antagonists for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disorders.

"The metalloprotease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats member 13) prevents microvascular thrombosis by cleaving von Willebrand factor (VWF) within platelet-rich thrombi, and cleavage depends on allosteric activation of ADAMTS13 by the substrate VWF. Human ADAMTS13 has a short propeptide, metalloprotease (M), disintegrin-like (D), thrombospondin-1 (T), Cys-rich (C), and spacer (S) domains (proximal domains), followed by 7 T and 2 CUB (complement components C1r and C1s, sea urchin protein Uegf, and bone morphogenetic protein-1) domains (distal domains). Distal domains inhibit the catalytic proximal domains; binding of distal T8-CUB domains to the VWF D4 domain relieves autoinhibition and promotes cleavage of the nearby VWF A2 domain. However, the role of specific ADAMTS13 distal domains in this allosteric mechanism is not established. Assays of plasma ADAMTS13 from 20 placental mammals, birds, and amphibians show that allosteric regulation is broadly conserved, and phylogenetic analysis of 264 vertebrates shows the long propeptide, T3, T4, T6, and T6a domains have been deleted several times in placental mammals, birds, and fish. Notably, pigeon ADAMTS13 has only 3 distal T domains but was activated normally by human VWF D4 and cleaved VWF multimers, preferentially under fluid shear stress. Human ADAMTS13 constructed to resemble pigeon ADAMTS13 retained normal allosteric regulation and shear-dependent cleavage of VWF. Thus, the T3-T6 domains of human ADAMTS13 are dispensable. Conversely, deletion of T7 or T8 abolished allosteric activation. For most species, some sequence changes in the VWF substrate can markedly increase the rate of cleavage, suggesting that ADAMTS13 and VWF have not evolved to be optimal enzyme-substrate pairs. These properties may reflect evolutionary pressure to balance the risk for VWF-dependent bleeding and thrombosis.

"BACKGROUND: Although the importance of host plant chemistry in plant-insect interactions is widely recognized, our understanding about the genetic basis underlying the relationship between changes in midgut proteins and adaptation of plant-feeding insects to novel host plants and habitats is very limited. To address this knowledge gap, the transcriptional profiles of midguts among three populations of the cicada Subpsaltria yangi Chen were compared. Among which, the Hancheng (HC) and Fengxiang (FX) populations occurring in the Loess Plateau feed on Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H. F. Chow, while the population occurring in a much drier habitat in the Helan (HL) Mountains is locally specialized on a chemically divergent plant, Ephedra lepidosperma C. Y. Cheng. RESULTS: Based on comparative analysis, 1826 (HL vs HC) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 723 DEGs (HL vs FX) were identified between the populations utilizing different host plants, including 20, 36, 2, 5 and 2 genes related to digestion, detoxification, oxidation-reduction, stress response and water-deprivation response, respectively, and 35 genes presumably associated with osmoregulation. However, only 183 DEGs were identified between the HC and FX populations, including two genes related to detoxification, two genes related to stress response, and one gene presumably associated with osmoregulation. These results suggest that the weakest expression differences were between the populations utilizing the same host plant and occurring in the closest habitats, which may help explain the metabolic mechanism of adaptation in S. yangi populations to novel host plants and new niches. CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences in gene expression among S. yangi populations are consistent with the hypothesis that the host plant shift and habitat adaptation in the HL population was facilitated by differential regulation of genes related to digestion, detoxification, oxidation-reduction, stress response, water-deprivation response and osmoregulation. The results may inform future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between changes in midgut proteins and adaptation of herbivorous insects to novel host plants and new niches.

"Camels have an important role in the lives of human beings, especially in arid regions, due to their multipurpose role and unique ability to adapt to harsh conditions. In spite of its enormous economic, cultural, and biological importance, the camel genome has not been widely studied. The size of camel genome is roughly 2.38 GB, containing over 20,000 genes. The unusual genetic makeup of the camel is the main reason behind its ability to survive under extreme environmental conditions. The camel genome harbors several unique variations which are being investigated for the treatment of several disorders. Various natural products from camels have also been tested and prescribed as adjunct therapy to control the progression of ailments. Interestingly, the camel employs unique immunological and molecular mechanisms against pathogenic agents and pathological conditions. Here, we broadly review camel classification, distribution and breed as well as recent progress in the determination of the camel genome, its size, genetic distribution, response to various physiological conditions, immunogenetics and the medicinal potential of camel gene products.

"Increasingly, human activities, including those aimed at conserving species and ecosystems (conservation activities) influence not only the survival and fitness but also the welfare of wild animals. Animal welfare relates to how an animal is experiencing its life and encompasses both its physical and mental states. While conservation biology and animal welfare science are both multi-disciplinary fields that use scientific methods to address concerns about animals, their focus and objectives sometimes appear to conflict. However, activities impacting detrimentally on the welfare of individual animals also hamper achievement of some conservation goals, and societal acceptance is imperative to the continuation of conservation activities. Thus, the best outcomes for both disciplines will be achieved through collaboration and knowledge-sharing. Despite this recognition, cross-disciplinary information-sharing and collaborative research and practice in conservation are still rare, with the exception of the zoo context. This paper summarizes key points developed by a group of conservation and animal welfare scientists discussing scientific assessment of wild animal welfare and barriers to progress. The dominant theme emerging was the need for a common language to facilitate cross-disciplinary progress in understanding and safeguarding the welfare of animals of wild species. Current conceptions of welfare implicit in conservation science, based mainly on ""fitness"" (physical states), need to be aligned with contemporary animal welfare science concepts which emphasize the dynamic integration of ""fitness"" and ""feelings"" (mental experiences) to holistically understand animals' welfare states. The way in which animal welfare is characterized influences the way it is evaluated and the emphasis put on different features of welfare, as well as, the importance placed on the outcomes of such evaluations and how that information is used, for example in policy development and decision-making. Salient examples from the New Zealand and Australian context are presented to illustrate. To genuinely progress our understanding and evaluation of wild animal welfare and optimize the aims of both scientific disciplines, conservation and animal welfare scientists should work together to evolve and apply a common understanding of welfare. To facilitate this, we propose the formal development of a new discipline, Conservation Welfare, integrating the expertise of scientists from both fields.

"Both exogenous and endogenous retroviruses have long been studied in mice, and some of the earliest mouse studies focused on the heritability of genetic factors influencing permissivity and resistance to infection. The prototypic retroviral restriction factor, Fv1, is now understood to exhibit a degree of control across multiple retroviral genera and is highly diverse within Mus To better understand the age and evolutionary history of Fv1, a comprehensive survey of the Muroidea was conducted, allowing the progenitor integration to be dated to ∼45 million years. Intact coding potential is visible beyond Mus, and sequence analysis reveals strong signatures of positive selection also within field mice, Apodemus Fv1's survival for such a period implies a recurring and shifting retroviral burden imparting the necessary selective pressures-an influence likely also common to analogous factors. Regions of Fv1 adapt cooperatively, highlighting its preference for repeated structures and suggesting that this functionally constrained aspect of the retroviral capsid lattice presents a common target in the evolution of intrinsic immunity.

"Channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is a highly adaptive species and has been used as a research model for comparative immunology, physiology, and toxicology among ectothermic vertebrates. It is also economically important for aquaculture. As such, its reference genome was generated and annotated with protein coding genes. However, the repetitive elements in the catfish genome are less well understood. In this study, over 417.8 Megabase (MB) of repetitive elements were identified and characterized in the channel catfish genome. Among them, the DNA/TcMar-Tc1 transposons are the most abundant type, making up ~20% of the total repetitive elements, followed by the microsatellites (14%). The prevalence of repetitive elements, especially the mobile elements, may have provided a driving force for the evolution of the catfish genome. A number of catfish-specific repetitive elements were identified including the previously reported Xba elements whose divergence rate was relatively low, slower than that in untranslated regions of genes but faster than the protein coding sequences, suggesting its evolutionary restrictions.

"CK2 is a pleiotropic S/T protein kinase (formerly known as casein kinase 2) which is attracting increasing interest as therapeutic target, and the identification of its substrates is a crucial step in determining its involvement in different pathological conditions. We recently found that S131 of Akt2 (homologous to the well established CK2 target S129 of Akt1) is not phosphorylated by CK2 either in vitro or in vivo, although the consensus sequence recognized by CK2 (S/T-x-x-E/D/pS/pT) is conserved in it. Here, by exploiting synthetic peptides, in cell transfection experiments, and computational analysis, we show that a single sequence element, a T at position n+1, hampers phosphorylation, causing an α-helix structure organization which prevents the recognition of its own consensus by CK2. Our results highlight the role of negative determinants as crucial modulators of CK2 targeting and corroborate the concept that Akt1 and Akt2 display isoform specific features. Experiments with synthetic peptides suggest that Akt2 S131 could be phosphorylated by kinases of the Plk (Polo-like kinase) family, which are insensitive to the presence of the n+1 T. The low phylogenetic conservation of the Akt2 sequence around S131, as opposed to the extremely well-conserved Akt1 homologous sequence, would indicate a dominant positive role in the selective pressure only for the Akt1 phosphoacceptor site committed to undergo phosphorylation by CK2. By contrast, Akt2 S131 may mediate the response to specific physio/pathological conditions, being consequently shielded against basal CK2 targeting.

"Type I natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like T lymphocytes that recognize glycolipid antigens presented by the MHC class I-like protein CD1d. Agonistic activation of NKT cells leads to rapid pro-inflammatory and immune modulatory cytokine and chemokine responses. This property of NKT cells, in conjunction with their interactions with antigen-presenting cells, controls downstream innate and adaptive immune responses against cancers and infectious diseases, as well as in several inflammatory disorders. NKT cell properties are acquired during development in the thymus and by interactions with the host microbial consortium in the gut, the nature of which can be influenced by NKT cells. This latter property, together with the role of the host microbiota in cancer therapy, necessitates a new perspective. Hence, this review provides an initial approach to understanding NKT cells from an ecological evolutionary developmental biology (eco-evo-devo) perspective.

"Heterochromatin is a key architectural feature of eukaryotic chromosomes, which endows particular genomic domains with specific functional properties. The capacity of heterochromatin to restrain the activity of mobile elements, isolate DNA repair in repetitive regions and ensure accurate chromosome segregation is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Nucleosomes at heterochromatin regions display histone post-translational modifications that contribute to developmental regulation by restricting lineage-specific gene expression. The mechanisms of heterochromatin establishment and of heterochromatin maintenance are separable and involve the ability of sequence-specific factors bound to nascent transcripts to recruit chromatin-modifying enzymes. Heterochromatin can spread along the chromatin from nucleation sites. The propensity of heterochromatin to promote its own spreading and inheritance is counteracted by inhibitory factors. Because of its importance for chromosome function, heterochromatin has key roles in the pathogenesis of various human diseases. In this Review, we discuss conserved principles of heterochromatin formation and function using selected examples from studies of a range of eukaryotes, from yeast to human, with an emphasis on insights obtained from unicellular model organisms.

"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH1) and its receptor (GnRHR1) drive mammalian reproduction via regulation of the gonadotropins. Yet, a second form of GnRH (GnRH2) and its receptor (GnRHR2) also exist in mammals. GnRH2 has been completely conserved throughout 500 million years of evolution, signifying high selection pressure and a critical biological role. However, the GnRH2 gene is absent (e.g., rat) or inactivated (e.g., cow and sheep) in some species but retained in others (e.g., human, horse, and pig). Likewise, many species (e.g., human, chimpanzee, cow, and sheep) retain the GnRHR2 gene but lack the appropriate coding sequence to produce a full-length protein due to gene coding errors; although production of GnRHR2 in humans remains controversial. Certain mammals lack the GnRHR2 gene (e.g., mouse) or most exons entirely (e.g., rat). In contrast, old world monkeys, musk shrews, and pigs maintain the coding sequence required to produce a functional GnRHR2. Like GnRHR1, GnRHR2 is a 7-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor that interacts with G(αq/11) to mediate cell signaling. However, GnRHR2 retains a cytoplasmic tail and is only 40% homologous to GnRHR1. A role for GnRH2 and its receptor in mammals has been elusive, likely because common laboratory models lack both the ligand and receptor. Uniquely, both GnRH2 and GnRHR2 are ubiquitously expressed; transcript levels are abundant in peripheral tissues and scarcely found in regions of the brain associated with gonadotropin secretion, suggesting a divergent role from GnRH1/GnRHR1. Indeed, GnRH2 and its receptor are not physiological modulators of gonadotropin secretion in mammals. Instead, GnRH2 and GnRHR2 coordinate the interaction between nutritional status and sexual behavior in the female brain. Within peripheral tissues, GnRH2 and its receptor are novel regulators of reproductive organs. GnRH2 and GnRHR2 directly stimulate steroidogenesis within the porcine testis. In the female, GnRH2 and its receptor may help mediate placental function, implantation, and ovarian steroidogenesis. Furthermore, both the GnRH2 and GnRHR2 genes are expressed in human reproductive tumors and represent emerging targets for cancer treatment. Thus, GnRH2 and GnRHR2 have diverse functions in mammals which remain largely unexplored.

"The Concise Guide to PHARMACOLOGY 2017/18 provides concise overviews of the key properties of nearly 1800 human drug targets with an emphasis on selective pharmacology (where available), plus links to an open access knowledgebase of drug targets and their ligands (www.guidetopharmacology.org), which provides more detailed views of target and ligand properties. Although the Concise Guide represents approximately 400 pages, the material presented is substantially reduced compared to information and links presented on the website. It provides a permanent, citable, point-in-time record that will survive database updates. The full contents of this section can be found at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bph.13878/full. G protein-coupled receptors are one of the eight major pharmacological targets into which the Guide is divided, with the others being: ligand-gated ion channels, voltage-gated ion channels, other ion channels, nuclear hormone receptors, catalytic receptors, enzymes and transporters. These are presented with nomenclature guidance and summary information on the best available pharmacological tools, alongside key references and suggestions for further reading. The landscape format of the Concise Guide is designed to facilitate comparison of related targets from material contemporary to mid-2017, and supersedes data presented in the 2015/16 and 2013/14 Concise Guides and previous Guides to Receptors and Channels. It is produced in close conjunction with the Nomenclature Committee of the Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (NC-IUPHAR), therefore, providing official IUPHAR classification and nomenclature for human drug targets, where appropriate.

"We described genome-wide screening and characterization of microsatellites in the swamp eel genome. A total of 99,293 microsatellite loci were identified in the genome with an overall density of 179 microsatellites per megabase of genomic sequences. The dinucleotide microsatellites were the most abundant type representing 71% of the total microsatellite loci and the AC-rich motifs were the most recurrent in all repeat types. Microsatellite frequency decreased as numbers of repeat units increased, which was more obvious in long than short microsatellite motifs. Most of microsatellites were located in non-coding regions, whereas only approximately 1% of the microsatellites were detected in coding regions. Trinucleotide repeats were most abundant microsatellites in the coding regions, which represented amino acid repeats in proteins. There was a chromosome-biased distribution of microsatellites in non-coding regions, with the highest density of 203.95/Mb on chromosome 8 and the least on chromosome 7 (164.06/Mb). The most abundant dinucleotides (AC)n was mainly located on chromosome 8. Notably, genomic mapping showed that there was a chromosome-biased association of genomic distributions between microsatellites and transposon elements. Thus, the novel dataset of microsatellites in swamp eel provides a valuable resource for further studies on QTL-based selection breeding, genetic resource conservation and evolutionary genetics.

"Centrosomal protein of 192 kDa (CEP192) is a scaffolding protein that recruits the mitotic protein kinases Aurora A and PLK1 to the centrosome. Here we demonstrate that CEP192 also recruits the type one protein phosphatase (PP1) via a highly conserved KHVTF docking motif. The threonine of the KHVTF motif is phosphorylated during mitosis and protein kinase inhibition studies suggest this to be a PLK1-dependent process.

"Disruption of the O-mannosylation pathway involved in functional glycosylation of α-dystroglycan gives rise to congenital muscular dystrophies. Protein O-linked mannose β-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 2 (POMGNT2) catalyzes the first step toward the functional matriglycan structure on α-dystroglycan that is responsible for binding extracellular matrix proteins and certain arenaviruses. Alternatively, protein O-linked mannose β-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (POMGNT1) catalyzes the first step toward other various glycan structures present on α-dystroglycan of unknown function. Here, we demonstrate that POMGNT1 is promiscuous for O-mannosylated peptides, whereas POMGNT2 displays significant primary amino acid selectivity near the site of O-mannosylation. We define a POMGNT2 acceptor motif, conserved among 59 vertebrate species, in α-dystroglycan that when engineered into a POMGNT1-only site is sufficient to convert the O-mannosylated peptide to a substrate for POMGNT2. Additionally, an acceptor glycopeptide is a less efficient substrate for POMGNT2 when two of the conserved amino acids are replaced. These findings begin to define the selectivity of POMGNT2 and suggest that this enzyme functions as a gatekeeper enzyme to prevent the vast majority of O-mannosylated sites on proteins from becoming modified with glycan structures functional for binding laminin globular domain-containing proteins.

"The aim of this review is to propose a Unified Theory of Alzheimer's disease (UTAD) that integrates all key behavioural, genetic and environmental risk factors in a causal chain of etiological and pathogenetic events. It is based on three concepts that emanate from human's evolutionary history: (1) The grandmother-hypothesis (GMH), which explains human longevity due to an evolutionary advantage in reproduction by trans-generational transfer of acquired knowledge. Consequently it is argued that mental health at old-age must be the default pathway of humans' genetic program and not development of AD. (2) Therefore, mechanism like neuronal rejuvenation (NRJ) and adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) that still function efficiently even at old age provide the required lifelong ability to memorize personal experiences important for survival. Cumulative evidence from a multitude of experimental and epidemiological studies indicate that behavioural and environmental risk factors, which impair productive AHN, result in reduced episodic memory performance and in reduced psychological resilience. This leads to avoidance of novelty, dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis and cortisol hypersecretion, which drives key pathogenic mechanisms of AD like the accumulation and oligomerization of synaptotoxic amyloid beta, chronic neuroinflammation and neuronal insulin resistance. (3) By applying to AHN the law of the minimum (LOM), which defines the basic requirements of biological growth processes, the UTAD explains why and how different lifestyle deficiencies initiate the AD process by impairing AHN and causing dysregulation of the HPA-axis, and how environmental and genetic risk factors such as toxins or ApoE4, respectively, turn into disease accelerators under these unnatural conditions. Consequently, the UTAD provides a rational strategy for the prevention of mental decline and a system-biological approach for the causal treatment of AD, which might even be curative if the systemic intervention is initiated early enough in the disease process. Hence an individualized system-biological treatment of patients with early AD is proposed as a test for the validity of UTAD and outlined in this review.

"The human cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily consisting of 57 functional genes is the most important group of Phase I drug metabolizing enzymes that oxidize a large number of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, including therapeutic drugs and environmental toxicants. The CYP superfamily has been shown to expand itself through gene duplication, and some of them become pseudogenes due to gene mutations. Orthologs and paralogs are homologous genes resulting from speciation or duplication, respectively. To explore the evolutionary and functional relationships of human CYPs, we conducted this bioinformatic study to identify their corresponding paralogs, homologs, and orthologs. The functional implications and implications in drug discovery and evolutionary biology were then discussed. GeneCards and Ensembl were used to identify the paralogs of human CYPs. We have used a panel of online databases to identify the orthologs of human CYP genes: NCBI, Ensembl Compara, GeneCards, OMA (""Orthologous MAtrix"") Browser, PATHER, TreeFam, EggNOG, and Roundup. The results show that each human CYP has various numbers of paralogs and orthologs using GeneCards and Ensembl. For example, the paralogs of CYP2A6 include CYP2A7, 2A13, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C18, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 2F1, 2J2, 2R1, 2S1, 2U1, and 2W1; CYP11A1 has 6 paralogs including CYP11B1, 11B2, 24A1, 27A1, 27B1, and 27C1; CYP51A1 has only three paralogs: CYP26A1, 26B1, and 26C1; while CYP20A1 has no paralog. The majority of human CYPs are well conserved from plants, amphibians, fishes, or mammals to humans due to their important functions in physiology and xenobiotic disposition. The data from different approaches are also cross-validated and validated when experimental data are available. These findings facilitate our understanding of the evolutionary relationships and functional implications of the human CYP superfamily in drug discovery.

"The MAP kinase signaling cascade Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK has been involved in a large variety of cellular and physiological processes that are crucial for life. Many pathological situations have been associated to this pathway. More than one isoform has been described at each level of the cascade. In this review we devoted our attention to ERK1 and ERK2, which are the effector kinases of the pathway. Whether ERK1 and ERK2 specify functional differences or are in contrast functionally redundant, constitutes an ongoing debate despite the huge amount of studies performed to date. In this review we compiled data on ERK1 vs. ERK2 gene structures, protein sequences, expression levels, structural and molecular mechanisms of activation and substrate recognition. We have also attempted to perform a rigorous analysis of studies regarding the individual roles of ERK1 and ERK2 by the means of morpholinos, siRNA, and shRNA silencing as well as gene disruption or gene replacement in mice. Finally, we comment on a recent study of gene and protein evolution of ERK isoforms as a distinct approach to address the same question. Our review permits the evaluation of the relevance of published studies in the field especially when measurements of global ERK activation are taken into account. Our analysis favors the hypothesis of ERK1 and ERK2 exhibiting functional redundancy and points to the concept of the global ERK quantity, and not isoform specificity, as being the essential determinant to achieve ERK function.

"Adult neurogenesis, defined here as progenitor cell division generating functionally integrated neurons in the adult brain, occurs within the hippocampus of numerous mammalian species including humans. The present review details various endogenous (e.g., neurotransmitters) and environmental (e.g., physical exercise) factors that have been shown to influence hippocampal adult neurogenesis. In addition, the potential involvement of adult-generated neurons in naturally-occurring spatial learning behavior is discussed by summarizing the literature focusing on traditional animal models (e.g., rats and mice), non-traditional animal models (e.g., tree shrews), as well as natural populations (e.g., chickadees and Siberian chipmunk).

"The study of the demographic history of species can help to understand the negative impact of recent population declines in organisms of conservation concern. Here, we use neutral molecular markers to explore the genetic consequences of the recent population decline and posterior recovery of the Eurasian eagle owl (Bubo bubo) in the Iberian Peninsula. During the last century, the species was the object of extermination programs, suffering direct persecution by hunters until the 70's. Moreover, during the last decades the eagle owl was severely impacted by increased mortality due to electrocution and the decline of its main prey species, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In recent times, the decrease of direct persecution and the implementation of some conservation schemes have allowed the species' demographic recovery. Yet, it remains unknown to which extent the past population decline and the later expansion have influenced the current species' pattern of genetic diversity. We used eight microsatellite markers to genotype 235 eagle owls from ten Spanish subpopulations and analyse the presence of genetic signatures attributable to the recent population fluctuations experienced by the species. We found moderate levels of differentiation among the studied subpopulations and Bayesian analyses revealed the existence of three genetic clusters that grouped subpopulations from central, south-western and south-eastern Spain. The observed genetic structure could have resulted from recent human-induced population fragmentation, a patchy distribution of prey populations and/or the philopatric behaviour and habitat selection of the species. We detected an old population bottleneck, which occurred approximately 10,000 years ago, and significant signatures of recent demographic expansions. However, we did not find genetic signatures for a recent bottleneck, which may indicate that population declines were not severe enough to leave detectable signals on the species genetic makeup or that such signals have been eroded by the rapid demographic recovery experienced by the species in recent years.

"BACKGROUND: Phlebotomus (Paraphlebotomus) sergenti is at least one of the confirmed vectors for the transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania tropica and distributed widely in Morocco. This form of leishmaniasis is considered largely as anthroponotic, although dogs were found infected with Leishmania tropica, suggestive of zoonosis in some rural areas. METHODOLOGY AND FINDINGS: This survey aimed at (i) studying the presence of Leishmania in field caught Phlebotomus sergenti, (ii) investigating genetic diversity within Leishmania tropica and (iii) identifying the host-blood feeding preferences of Phlebotomus sergenti. A total of 4,407 sand flies were collected in three rural areas of Azilal province, using CDC miniature light traps. Samples collected were found to consist of 13 species: Phlebotomus spp. and 3 Sergentomyia spp. The most abundant species was Phlebotomus sergenti, accounting for 45.75 % of the total. 965 female Phlebotomus sergenti were screened for the presence of Leishmania by ITS1-PCR-RFLP, giving a positive rate of 5.7% (55/965), all being identified as Leishmania tropica. Nucleotide heterogeneity of PCR-amplified ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene-ITS2 was noted. Analyses of 31 sequences obtained segregated them into 16 haplotypes, of which 7 contain superimposed peaks at certain nucleotide positions, suggestive of heterozygosity. Phlebotomus sergenti collected were found to feed on a large variety of vertebrate hosts, as determined by Cytochrome b sequencing of the DNA from the blood meals of 64 engorged females. CONCLUSION: Our findings supported the notion that Phlebotomus sergenti is the primary vector of Leishmania tropica in this focus, and that the latter is genetically very heterogeneous. Furthermore, our results might be suggestive of a certain level of heterozygosity in Leishmania tropica population. This finding, as well as the feeding of the vectors on different animals are of interest for further investigation.

"BACKGROUND: Endogenous Retroviruses (ERVs) are retroviruses that over the course of evolution have integrated into germline cells and eventually become part of the host genome. They proliferate within the germline of their host, making up ~5% of the human and mouse genome sequences. Several lines of evidence have suggested a decline in the rate of ERV integration into the human genome in recent evolutionary history but this has not been investigated quantitatively or possible causes explored. RESULTS: By dating the integration of ERV loci in 40 mammal species, we show that the human genome and that of other hominoids (great apes and gibbons) have experienced an approximately four-fold decline in the ERV integration rate over the last 10 million years. A major cause is the recent extinction of one very large ERV lineage (HERV-H), which is responsible for most of the integrations over the last 30 million years. The decline however affects most other ERV lineages. Only about 10% of the decline might be attributed to an accompanying increase in body mass (a trait we have shown recently to be negatively correlated with ERV integration rate). Humans are unusual compared to related species - Old World monkeys, great apes and gibbons - in (a) having not acquired any new ERV lineages during the last 30 million years and (b) the possession of an old ERV lineage that has continued to replicate up until at least the last few hundred thousand years - the potentially medically significant HERVK(HML2). CONCLUSIONS: The human genome shares with the genome of other great apes and gibbons a recent decline in ERV integration that is not typical of other primates and mammals. The human genome differs from that of related species both in maintaining up until at least recently a replicating old ERV lineage and in not having acquired any new lineages. We speculate that the decline in ERV integration in the human genome has been exacerbated by a relatively low burden of horizontally-transmitted retroviruses and subsequent reduced risk of endogenization.

"The Genome 10K Project was established in 2009 by a consortium of biologists and genome scientists determined to facilitate the sequencing and analysis of the complete genomes of 10,000 vertebrate species. Since then the number of selected and initiated species has risen from ∼26 to 277 sequenced or ongoing with funding, an approximately tenfold increase in five years. Here we summarize the advances and commitments that have occurred by mid-2014 and outline the achievements and present challenges of reaching the 10,000-species goal. We summarize the status of known vertebrate genome projects, recommend standards for pronouncing a genome as sequenced or completed, and provide our present and future vision of the landscape of Genome 10K. The endeavor is ambitious, bold, expensive, and uncertain, but together the Genome 10K Consortium of Scientists and the worldwide genomics community are moving toward their goal of delivering to the coming generation the gift of genome empowerment for many vertebrate species.

"BACKGROUND: The Syrian hamster (golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus) is gaining importance as a new experimental animal model for multiple pathogens, including emerging zoonotic diseases such as Ebola. Nevertheless there are currently no publicly available transcriptome reference sequences or genome for this species. RESULTS: A cDNA library derived from mRNA and snRNA isolated and pooled from the brains, lungs, spleens, kidneys, livers, and hearts of three adult female Syrian hamsters was sequenced. Sequence reads were assembled into 62,482 contigs and 111,796 reads remained unassembled (singletons). This combined contig/singleton dataset, designated as the Syrian hamster transcriptome, represents a total of 60,117,204 nucleotides. Our Mesocricetus auratus Syrian hamster transcriptome mapped to 11,648 mouse transcripts representing 9,562 distinct genes, and mapped to a similar number of transcripts and genes in the rat. We identified 214 quasi-complete transcripts based on mouse annotations. Canonical pathways involved in a broad spectrum of fundamental biological processes were significantly represented in the library. The Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned to the current release of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transcriptome and genome to improve the genomic annotation of this species. Finally, our Syrian hamster transcriptome was aligned against 14 other rodents, primate and laurasiatheria species to gain insights about the genetic relatedness and placement of this species. CONCLUSIONS: This Syrian hamster transcriptome dataset significantly improves our knowledge of the Syrian hamster's transcriptome, especially towards its future use in infectious disease research. Moreover, this library is an important resource for the wider scientific community to help improve genome annotation of the Syrian hamster and other closely related species. Furthermore, these data provide the basis for development of expression microarrays that can be used in functional genomics studies.

"Retroviruses have been infecting mammals for at least 100 million years, leaving descendants in host genomes known as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). The abundance of ERVs is partly determined by their mode of replication, but it has also been suggested that host life history traits could enhance or suppress their activity. We show that larger bodied species have lower levels of ERV activity by reconstructing the rate of ERV integration across 38 mammalian species. Body size explains 37% of the variance in ERV integration rate over the last 10 million years, controlling for the effect of confounding due to other life history traits. Furthermore, 68% of the variance in the mean age of ERVs per genome can also be explained by body size. These results indicate that body size limits the number of recently replicating ERVs due to their detrimental effects on their host. To comprehend the possible mechanistic links between body size and ERV integration we built a mathematical model, which shows that ERV abundance is favored by lower body size and higher horizontal transmission rates. We argue that because retroviral integration is tumorigenic, the negative correlation between body size and ERV numbers results from the necessity to reduce the risk of cancer, under the assumption that this risk scales positively with body size. Our model also fits the empirical observation that the lifetime risk of cancer is relatively invariant among mammals regardless of their body size, known as Peto's paradox, and indicates that larger bodied mammals may have evolved mechanisms to limit ERV activity.

"Glass micropipettes are widely used to record neural activity from single neurons or clusters of neurons extracellularly in live animals. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive study of noise in extracellular recordings with glass micropipettes. The purpose of this work was to assess various noise sources that affect extracellular recordings and to create model systems in which novel micropipette neural amplifier designs can be tested. An equivalent circuit of the glass micropipette and the noise model of this circuit, which accurately describe the various noise sources involved in extracellular recordings, have been developed. Measurement schemes using dead brain tissue as well as extracellular recordings from neurons in the inferior colliculus, an auditory brain nucleus of an anesthetized gerbil, were used to characterize noise performance and amplification efficacy of the proposed micropipette neural amplifier. According to our model, the major noise sources which influence the signal to noise ratio are the intrinsic noise of the neural amplifier and the thermal noise from distributed pipette resistance. These two types of noise were calculated and measured and were shown to be the dominating sources of background noise for in vivo experiments.

"Biologists routinely use molecular markers to identify conservation units, to quantify genetic connectivity, to estimate population sizes, and to identify targets of selection. Many imperiled eagle populations require such efforts and would benefit from enhanced genomic resources. We sequenced, assembled, and annotated the first eagle genome using DNA from a male golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) captured in western North America. We constructed genomic libraries that were sequenced using Illumina technology and assembled the high-quality data to a depth of ∼40x coverage. The genome assembly includes 2,552 scaffolds >10 Kb and 415 scaffolds >1.2 Mb. We annotated 16,571 genes that are involved in myriad biological processes, including such disparate traits as beak formation and color vision. We also identified repetitive regions spanning 92 Mb (∼6% of the assembly), including LINES, SINES, LTR-RTs and DNA transposons. The mitochondrial genome encompasses 17,332 bp and is ∼91% identical to the Mountain Hawk-Eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis). Finally, the data reveal that several anonymous microsatellites commonly used for population studies are embedded within protein-coding genes and thus may not have evolved in a neutral fashion. Because the genome sequence includes ∼800,000 novel polymorphisms, markers can now be chosen based on their proximity to functional genes involved in migration, carnivory, and other biological processes.

"Bone Morphogenetic Protein 15 (BMP15) is a TGFβ-like oocyte-derived growth factor involved in ovarian folliculogenesis as a critical regulator of many granulosa cell processes. Alterations of the BMP15 gene have been found associated with different ovarian phenotypic effects depending on the species, from sterility to increased prolificacy in sheep, slight subfertility in mouse or associated with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) in women. To investigate the evolving role of BMP15, a phylogenetic analysis of this particular TGFβ family member was performed. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of several TGFβ/BMP family members expressed by the ovary showed that BMP15 has a very strong divergence and a rapid evolution compared to others. Moreover, among 24 mammalian species, we detected signals of positive selection in the hominidae clade corresponding to F146, L189 and Y235 residues in human BMP15. The biological importance of these residues was tested functionally after site directed-mutagenesis in a COV434 cells luciferase assay. By replacing the positively selected amino acid either by alanine or the most represented residue in other studied species, only L189A, Y235A and Y235C mutants showed a significant increase of BMP15 signaling when compared to wild type. Additionally, the Y235C mutant was more potent than wild type in inhibiting progesterone secretion of ovine granulosa cells in primary culture. Interestingly, the Y235C mutation was previously identified in association with POI in women. In conclusion, this study evidences that the BMP15 gene has evolved faster than other members of the TGFß family and was submitted to a positive selection pressure in the hominidae clade. Some residues under positive selection are of great importance for the normal function of the protein and thus for female fertility. Y235 represents a critical residue in the determination of BMP15 biological activity, thus indirectly confirming its role in the onset of POI in women.

"Several studies on 5S ribosomal DNA (5S rDNA) have been focused on a subset of the following features in mostly one organism: number of copies, pseudogenes, secondary structure, promoter and terminator characteristics, genomic arrangements, types of non-transcribed spacers and evolution. In this work, we systematically analyzed 5S rDNA sequence diversity in available metazoan genomes, and showed organism-specific and evolutionary-conserved features. Putatively functional sequences (12,766) from 97 organisms allowed us to identify general features of this multigene family in animals. Interestingly, we show that each mammal species has a highly conserved (housekeeping) 5S rRNA type and many variable ones. The genomic organization of 5S rDNA is still under debate. Here, we report the occurrence of several paralog 5S rRNA sequences in 58 of the examined species, and a flexible genome organization of 5S rDNA in animals. We found heterogeneous 5S rDNA clusters in several species, supporting the hypothesis of an exchange of 5S rDNA from one locus to another. A rather high degree of variation of upstream, internal and downstream putative regulatory regions appears to characterize metazoan 5S rDNA. We systematically studied the internal promoters and described three different types of termination signals, as well as variable distances between the coding region and the typical termination signal. Finally, we present a statistical method for detection of linkage among noncoding RNA (ncRNA) gene families. This method showed no evolutionary-conserved linkage among 5S rDNAs and any other ncRNA genes within Metazoa, even though we found 5S rDNA to be linked to various ncRNAs in several clades.

"BACKGROUND: The physiological functions of the human Sterile Alpha Motif Domain-containing 9 (SAMD9) gene and its chromosomally adjacent paralogue, SAMD9-like (SAMD9L), currently remain unknown. However, the direct links between the deleterious mutations or deletions in these two genes and several human disorders, such as inherited inflammatory calcified tumors and acute myeloid leukemia, suggest their biological importance. SAMD9 and SAMD9L have also recently been shown to play key roles in the innate immune responses to stimuli such as viral infection. We were particularly interested in understanding the mammalian evolutionary history of these two genes. The phylogeny of SAMD9 and SAMD9L genes was reconstructed using the Maximum Likelihood method. Furthermore, six different methods were applied to detect SAMD9 and SAMD9L codons under selective pressure: the site-specific model M8 implemented in the codeml program in PAML software and five methods available on the Datamonkey web server, including the Single Likelihood Ancestor Counting method, the Fixed Effect Likelihood method, the Random Effect Likelihood method, the Mixed Effects Model of Evolution method and the Fast Unbiased Bayesian AppRoximation method. Additionally, the house mouse (Mus musculus) genome has lost the SAMD9 gene, while keeping SAMD9L intact, prompting us to investigate whether this loss is a unique event during evolution. RESULTS: Our evolutionary analyses suggest that SAMD9 and SAMD9L arose through an ancestral gene duplication event after the divergence of Marsupialia from Placentalia. Additionally, selection analyses demonstrated that both genes have been subjected to positive evolutionary selection. The absence of either SAMD9 or SAMD9L genes from some mammalian species supports a partial functional redundancy between the two genes. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study on the evolutionary history of mammalian SAMD9 and SAMD9L genes. We conclude that evolutionary selective pressure has acted on both of these two genes since their divergence, suggesting their importance in multiple cellular processes, such as the immune responses to viral pathogens.

"Evolutionary rates of functionally related proteins tend to change in parallel over evolutionary time. Such evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) is a sequence-based signature of coevolution and a potentially useful signature to infer functional relationships between proteins. One major hypothesis to explain ERC is that fluctuations in evolutionary pressure acting on entire pathways cause parallel rate changes for functionally related proteins. To explore this hypothesis we analyzed ERC within DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and meiosis proteins over phylogenies of 18 yeast species and 22 mammalian species. We identified a strong signature of ERC between eight yeast proteins involved in meiotic crossing over, which seems to have resulted from relaxation of constraint specifically in Candida glabrata. These and other meiotic proteins in C. glabrata showed marked rate acceleration, likely due to its apparently clonal reproductive strategy and the resulting infrequent use of meiotic proteins. This correlation between change of reproductive mode and change in constraint supports an evolutionary pressure origin for ERC. Moreover, we present evidence for similar relaxations of constraint in additional pathogenic yeast species. Mammalian MMR and meiosis proteins also showed statistically significant ERC; however, there was not strong ERC between crossover proteins, as observed in yeasts. Rather, mammals exhibited ERC in different pathways, such as piRNA-mediated defense against transposable elements. Overall, if fluctuation in evolutionary pressure is responsible for ERC, it could reveal functional relationships within entire protein pathways, regardless of whether they physically interact or not, so long as there was variation in constraint on that pathway.

"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intimately tied to amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. Extraneuronal brain plaques consisting primarily of Aβ aggregates are a hallmark of AD. Intraneuronal Aβ subunits are strongly implicated in disease progression. Protein sequence mutations of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) account for a small proportion of AD cases, suggesting that regulation of the associated gene (APP) may play a more important role in AD etiology. The APP promoter possesses a novel 30 nucleotide sequence, or ""proximal regulatory element"" (PRE), at -76/-47, from the +1 transcription start site that confers cell type specificity. This PRE contains sequences that make it vulnerable to epigenetic modification and may present a viable target for drug studies. We examined PRE-nuclear protein interaction by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and PRE mutant EMSA. This was followed by functional studies of PRE mutant/reporter gene fusion clones. RESULTS: EMSA probed with the PRE showed DNA-protein interaction in multiple nuclear extracts and in human brain tissue nuclear extract in a tissue-type specific manner. We identified transcription factors that are likely to bind the PRE, using competition gel shift and gel supershift: Activator protein 2 (AP2), nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase/metastatic inhibitory protein (PuF), and specificity protein 1 (SP1). These sites crossed a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). EMSA with PRE mutants and promoter/reporter clone transfection analysis further implicated PuF in cells and extracts. Functional assays of mutant/reporter clone transfections were evaluated by ELISA of reporter protein levels. EMSA and ELISA results correlated by meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that PuF may regulate the APP gene promoter and that AD risk may be increased by interference with PuF regulation at the PRE. PuF is targeted by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor 1, which also interacts with the integrins. These proteins are connected to vital cellular and neurological functions. In addition, the transcription factor PuF is a known inhibitor of metastasis and regulates cell growth during development. Given that APP is a known cell adhesion protein and ferroxidase, this suggests biochemical links among cell signaling, the cell cycle, iron metabolism in cancer, and AD in the context of overall aging.

"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of parasitic infections among commensal animals such as black and brown rats in many tropical countries is high and in comparison with studies on rodents in temperate climates, little is known about the community structure of their parasites. Rodent borne parasites pose threats to human health since people living in close proximity to rodent populations can be exposed to infection. METHODS: The helminth community structures of two urban rat populations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia were investigated. The rats were from two contrasting sites in the city caught over a period of 21 months in 2000-2002. RESULTS: Eleven species of helminth parasites comprising seven nematodes (Heterakis spumosum, Mastophorus muris, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, Syphacia muris, Pterygodermatites tani/whartoni, Gongylonema neoplasticum, Angiostrongylus malaysiensis), three cestodes (Hymenolepis (Rodentolepis) nana, H. diminuta and Taenia taeniaeformis) and one acanthocephalan (Moniliformis moniliformis) were recovered from 346 Rattus rattus and 104 R. norvegicus from two urban sites, Bangsar and Chow Kit, during 2000-2002. Rattus rattus harboured over 60% of all helminths compared with R. norvegicus, although both host species played a dominant role in the different sites with, for example R. norvegicus at Bangsar and R. rattus at Chow Kit accounting for most of the nematodes. Overall 80% of rats carried at least one species of helminth, with the highest prevalences being shown by H. diminuta (35%), H. spumosum (29.8%) and H. nana (28.4%). Nevertheless, there were marked differences in prevalence rates between sites and hosts. The influence of extrinsic (year, season and site) and intrinsic (species, sex and age) factors affecting infracommunity structure (abundance and prevalence of infection) and measures of component community structure were analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: Since at least two species of rat borne helminths in Kuala Lumpur have the potential to infect humans, and these showed high prevalences in the rats, the assessment and regular monitoring of infections carried by wild rodents have important roles to play in public health.

"Scaling of cardiac electrophysiology with body mass requires large changes in the ventricular action potential duration and heart rate in mammals. These changes in cellular electrophysiological function are produced by systematic and coordinated changes in the expression of multiple ion channel and transporter genes. Expression of one important potassium current, the transient outward current (I(to)), changes significantly during mammalian evolution. Changes in I(to) expression are determined, in part, by variation in the expression of an obligatory auxiliary subunit encoded by the KChIP2 gene. The KChIP2 gene is expressed in both cardiac myocytes and neurons and transcription in both cell types is initiated from the same CpG island promoter. Species-dependent variation of KChIP2 expression in heart is mediated by the evolution of the cis-regulatory function of this gene. Surprisingly, the major locus of evolutionary change for KChIP2 gene expression in heart lies within the CpG island core promoter. The results demonstrate that CpG island promoters are not simply permissive for gene expression but can also contribute to tissue-selective expression and, as such, can function as an important locus for the evolution of cis-regulatory function. More generally, evolution of the cis-regulatory function of voltage-gated ion channel genes appears to be an effective and efficient way to modify channel expression levels to optimize electrophysiological function.

"This chapter discusses the clinical biochemistry and hematology of the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), and other rodents, including the gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus), chinchilla (Chinchilla laniger), degu (Octodon degus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), dormouse (Gliridae family), kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spp.), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), and sand rat (Psammomys obesus). The chapter begins with a review of sample collection and preparation, and a description of commonly measured parameters and analytical techniques. The reference values, sources of variation, and unique characteristics are then presented for each species, as available. Many variables affect the parameters of clinical biochemistry and hematology including methods of sample collection and preparation, equipment, reagents, and methods of analysis, as well as the age, sex, breed, and environment of the animals being sampled. Values obtained from a clinical case are usually compared with reference values that are either produced in the same laboratory or in a similar group of animals, or cited in the literature. Optimal sites for blood collection vary between laboratory animals and are described in this chapter for each species for which information is available. Total blood volume of the rabbit is discussed in the Hematology section of the chapter. The rabbit is recognized as a valuable model for human disturbances in lipid metabolism, such as the metabolic syndrome and hypercholesterolemia leading to atherosclerosis. Hematology is the study of blood and blood-forming organs, including the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases of the blood, bone marrow, and immunologic, hemostatic, and vascular systems. Hematologic analysis is often used for the diagnosis and treatment of animal diseases.

"BACKGROUND: Matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) belongs to a family of small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs) that play a key role in skeleton development, particularly in mineralization, phosphate regulation and osteogenesis. MEPE associated disorders cause various physiological effects, such as loss of bone mass, tumors and disruption of renal function (hypophosphatemia). The study of this developmental gene from an evolutionary perspective could provide valuable insights on the adaptive diversification of morphological phenotypes in vertebrates. RESULTS: Here we studied the adaptive evolution of the MEPE gene in 26 Eutherian mammals and three birds. The comparative genomic analyses revealed a high degree of evolutionary conservation of some coding and non-coding regions of the MEPE gene across mammals indicating a possible regulatory or functional role likely related with mineralization and/or phosphate regulation. However, the majority of the coding region had a fast evolutionary rate, particularly within the largest exon (1467 bp). Rodentia and Scandentia had distinct substitution rates with an increased accumulation of both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations compared with other mammalian lineages. Characteristics of the gene (e.g. biochemical, evolutionary rate, and intronic conservation) differed greatly among lineages of the eight mammalian orders. We identified 20 sites with significant positive selection signatures (codon and protein level) outside the main regulatory motifs (dentonin and ASARM) suggestive of an adaptive role. Conversely, we find three sites under selection in the signal peptide and one in the ASARM motif that were supported by at least one selection model. The MEPE protein tends to accumulate amino acids promoting disorder and potential phosphorylation targets. CONCLUSION: MEPE shows a high number of selection signatures, revealing the crucial role of positive selection in the evolution of this SIBLING member. The selection signatures were found mainly outside the functional motifs, reinforcing the idea that other regions outside the dentonin and the ASARM might be crucial for the function of the protein and future studies should be undertaken to understand its importance.

"The human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) Rev protein regulates the nuclear export of intron-containing viral RNAs by recruiting the CRM1 nuclear export receptor. Here, we employed a combination of functional and phylogenetic analyses to identify and characterize a species-specific determinant within human CRM1 (hCRM1) that largely overcomes established defects in murine cells to the post-transcriptional stages of the HIV-1 life cycle. hCRM1 expression in murine cells promotes the cytoplasmic accumulation of intron-containing viral RNAs, resulting in a substantial stimulation of the net production of infectious HIV-1 particles. These stimulatory effects require a novel surface-exposed element within HEAT repeats 9A and 10A, discrete from the binding cleft previously shown to engage Rev's leucine-rich nuclear export signal. Moreover, we show that this element is a unique feature of higher primate CRM1 proteins, and discuss how this sequence has evolved from a non-functional, ancestral sequence.

"The functional repertoire of a cell is largely embodied in its proteome, the collection of proteins encoded in the genome of an organism. The molecular functions of proteins are the direct consequence of their structure and structure can be inferred from sequence using hidden Markov models of structural recognition. Here we analyze the functional annotation of protein domain structures in almost a thousand sequenced genomes, exploring the functional and structural diversity of proteomes. We find there is a remarkable conservation in the distribution of domains with respect to the molecular functions they perform in the three superkingdoms of life. In general, most of the protein repertoire is spent in functions related to metabolic processes but there are significant differences in the usage of domains for regulatory and extra-cellular processes both within and between superkingdoms. Our results support the hypotheses that the proteomes of superkingdom Eukarya evolved via genome expansion mechanisms that were directed towards innovating new domain architectures for regulatory and extra/intracellular process functions needed for example to maintain the integrity of multicellular structure or to interact with environmental biotic and abiotic factors (e.g., cell signaling and adhesion, immune responses, and toxin production). Proteomes of microbial superkingdoms Archaea and Bacteria retained fewer numbers of domains and maintained simple and smaller protein repertoires. Viruses appear to play an important role in the evolution of superkingdoms. We finally identify few genomic outliers that deviate significantly from the conserved functional design. These include Nanoarchaeum equitans, proteobacterial symbionts of insects with extremely reduced genomes, Tenericutes and Guillardia theta. These organisms spend most of their domains on information functions, including translation and transcription, rather than on metabolism and harbor a domain repertoire characteristic of parasitic organisms. In contrast, the functional repertoire of the proteomes of the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae superphylum was no different than the rest of bacteria, failing to support claims of them representing a separate superkingdom. In turn, Protista and Bacteria shared similar functional distribution patterns suggesting an ancestral evolutionary link between these groups.

"Our previous microarray study showed that the non-specific cytotoxic cell receptor protein 1 (Nccrp1) transcript is significantly upregulated in the gastric mucosa of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX)-deficient (Car9(-/-)) mice. In this paper, we aimed to characterize human NCCRP1 and to elucidate its relationship to CA IX. Recombinant NCCRP1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and a novel polyclonal antiserum was raised against the purified full-length protein. Immunocytochemistry showed that NCCRP1 is expressed intracellularly, even though it has previously been described as a transmembrane protein. Using bioinformatic analyses, we identified orthologs of NCCRP1 in 35 vertebrate genomes, and up to five paralogs per genome. These paralogs are FBXO genes whose protein products are components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes. NCCRP1 proteins have no signal peptides or transmembrane domains. NCCRP1 has mainly been studied in fish and was thought to be responsible for the cytolytic function of nonspecific cytotoxic cells (NCCs). Our analyses showed that in humans, NCCRP1 mRNA is expressed in tissues containing squamous epithelium, whereas it shows a more ubiquitous tissue expression pattern in mice. Neither human nor mouse NCCRP1 expression is specific to immune tissues. Silencing CA9 using siRNAs did not affect NCCRP1 levels, indicating that its expression is not directly regulated by CA9. Interestingly, silencing NCCRP1 caused a statistically significant decrease in the growth of HeLa cells. These studies provide ample evidence that the current name, ""non-specific cytotoxic cell receptor protein 1,"" is not appropriate. We therefore propose that the gene name be changed to FBXO50.

"Parvoviruses infect humans and a broad range of animals, from mammals to crustaceans, and generally are associated with a variety of acute and chronic diseases. However, many others cause persistent infections and are not known to be associated with any disease. Viral persistence is likely related to the ability to integrate into the chromosomal DNA and to establish a latent infection. However, there is little evidence for genome integration of parvoviral DNA except for Adeno-associated virus (AAV). Here we performed a systematic search for homologs of parvoviral proteins in publicly available eukaryotic genome databases followed by experimental verification and phylogenetic analysis. We conclude that parvoviruses have frequently invaded the germ lines of diverse animal species, including mammals, fishes, birds, tunicates, arthropods, and flatworms. The identification of orthologous endogenous parvovirus sequences in the genomes of humans and other mammals suggests that parvoviruses have coexisted with mammals for at least 98 million years. Furthermore, some of the endogenized parvoviral genes were expressed in eukaryotic organisms, suggesting that these viral genes are also functional in the host genomes. Our findings may provide novel insights into parvovirus biology, host interactions, and evolution.

"Until now the most efficient solution to align nucleotide sequences containing open reading frames was to use indirect procedures that align amino acid translation before reporting the inferred gap positions at the codon level. There are two important pitfalls with this approach. Firstly, any premature stop codon impedes using such a strategy. Secondly, each sequence is translated with the same reading frame from beginning to end, so that the presence of a single additional nucleotide leads to both aberrant translation and alignment.We present an algorithm that has the same space and time complexity as the classical Needleman-Wunsch algorithm while accommodating sequencing errors and other biological deviations from the coding frame. The resulting pairwise coding sequence alignment method was extended to a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithm implemented in a program called MACSE (Multiple Alignment of Coding SEquences accounting for frameshifts and stop codons). MACSE is the first automatic solution to align protein-coding gene datasets containing non-functional sequences (pseudogenes) without disrupting the underlying codon structure. It has also proved useful in detecting undocumented frameshifts in public database sequences and in aligning next-generation sequencing reads/contigs against a reference coding sequence.MACSE is distributed as an open-source java file executable with freely available source code and can be used via a web interface at: http://mbb.univ-montp2.fr/macse.

"HDV ribozymes catalyze their own scission from the transcript during rolling circle replication of the hepatitis delta virus. In vitro selection of self-cleaving ribozymes from a human genomic library revealed an HDV-like ribozyme in the second intron of the human CPEB3 gene and recent results suggest that this RNA affects episodic memory performance. Bioinformatic searches based on the secondary structure of the HDV/CPEB3 fold yielded numerous functional ribozymes in a wide variety of organisms. Genomic mapping of these RNAs suggested several biological roles, one of which is the 5' processing of non-LTR retrotransposons. The family of HDV-like ribozymes thus continues to grow in numbers and biological importance.

"The two primary photoreceptor-specific tetraspanins are retinal degeneration slow (RDS) and rod outer segment membrane protein-1 (ROM-1). These proteins associate together to form different complexes necessary for the proper structure of the photoreceptor outer segment rim region. Mutations in RDS cause blinding retinal degenerative disease in both rods and cones by mechanisms that remain unknown. Tetraspanins are implicated in a variety of cellular processes and exert their function via the formation of tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. This review focuses on correlations between RDS and other members of the tetraspanin superfamily, particularly emphasizing protein structure, complex assembly, and post-translational modifications, with the goal of furthering our understanding of the structural and functional role of RDS and ROM-1 in outer segment morphogenesis and maintenance, and our understanding of the pathogenesis associated with RDS and ROM-1 mutations.

"BACKGROUND: Members of the makorin (mkrn) gene family encode RING/C3H zinc finger proteins with U3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Although these proteins have been described in a variety of eukaryotes such as plants, fungi, invertebrates and vertebrates including human, almost nothing is known about their structural and functional evolution. RESULTS: Via partial sequencing of a testis cDNA library from the poeciliid fish Xiphophorus maculatus, we have identified a new member of the makorin gene family, that we called mkrn4. In addition to the already described mkrn1 and mkrn2, mkrn4 is the third example of a makorin gene present in both tetrapods and ray-finned fish. However, this gene was not detected in mouse and rat, suggesting its loss in the lineage leading to rodent murids. Mkrn2 and mkrn4 are located in large ancient duplicated regions in tetrapod and fish genomes, suggesting the possible involvement of ancestral vertebrate-specific genome duplication in the formation of these genes. Intriguingly, many mkrn1 and mkrn2 intronless retrocopies have been detected in mammals but not in other vertebrates, most of them corresponding to pseudogenes. The nature and number of zinc fingers were found to be conserved in Mkrn1 and Mkrn2 but much more variable in Mkrn4, with lineage-specific differences. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated a highly gonad-biased expression pattern for makorin genes in medaka and zebrafish (ray-finned fishes) and amphibians, but a strong relaxation of this specificity in birds and mammals. All three mkrn genes were maternally expressed before zygotic genome activation in both medaka and zebrafish early embryos. CONCLUSION: Our analysis demonstrates that the makorin gene family has evolved through large-scale duplication and subsequent lineage-specific retroposition-mediated duplications in vertebrates. From the three major vertebrate mkrn genes, mkrn4 shows the highest evolutionary dynamics, with lineage-specific loss of zinc fingers and even complete gene elimination from certain groups of vertebrates. Comparative expression analysis strongly suggests that the ancestral E3 ubiquitin ligase function of the single copy mkrn gene before duplication in vertebrates was gonad-specific, with maternal expression in early embryos.

"Integration into the nuclear genome of germ line cells can lead to vertical inheritance of retroviral genes as host alleles. For other viruses, germ line integration has only rarely been documented. Nonetheless, we identified endogenous viral elements (EVEs) derived from ten non-retroviral families by systematic in silico screening of animal genomes, including the first endogenous representatives of double-stranded RNA, reverse-transcribing DNA, and segmented RNA viruses, and the first endogenous DNA viruses in mammalian genomes. Phylogenetic and genomic analysis of EVEs across multiple host species revealed novel information about the origin and evolution of diverse virus groups. Furthermore, several of the elements identified here encode intact open reading frames or are expressed as mRNA. For one element in the primate lineage, we provide statistically robust evidence for exaptation. Our findings establish that genetic material derived from all known viral genome types and replication strategies can enter the animal germ line, greatly broadening the scope of paleovirological studies and indicating a more significant evolutionary role for gene flow from virus to animal genomes than has previously been recognized.

"BACKGROUND: TGR5, the G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1), has been linked to inflammatory pathways as well as bile homeostasis, and could therefore be involved in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) a chronic inflammatory bile duct disease. We aimed to extensively investigate TGR5 sequence variation in PSC, as well as functionally characterize detected variants. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Complete resequencing of TGR5 was performed in 267 PSC patients and 274 healthy controls. Six nonsynonymous mutations were identified in addition to 16 other novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms. To investigate the impact from the nonsynonymous variants on TGR5, we created a receptor model, and introduced mutated TGR5 constructs into human epithelial cell lines. By using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry and a cAMP-sensitive luciferase assay, five of the nonsynonymous mutations (W83R, V178M, A217P, S272G and Q296X) were found to reduce or abolish TGR5 function. Fine-mapping of the previously reported PSC and UC associated locus at chromosome 2q35 in large patient panels revealed an overall association between the TGR5 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11554825 and PSC (odds ratio = 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.26, p = 0.010) and UC (odds ratio = 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.11-1.27, p = 8.5 x 10(-7)), but strong linkage disequilibrium precluded demarcation of TGR5 from neighboring genes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Resequencing of TGR5 along with functional investigations of novel variants provided unique insight into an important candidate gene for several inflammatory and metabolic conditions. While significant TGR5 associations were detected in both UC and PSC, further studies are needed to conclusively define the role of TGR5 variation in these diseases.

"BACKGROUND: Dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) is the largest member of the SIBLING family and is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in dentin. DSPP is also expressed in non-mineralized tissues including metabolically active ductal epithelia and some cancers. Its function, however, is poorly defined. The carboxy-terminal fragment, dentin phosphoprotein (DPP) is encoded predominantly by a large repetitive domain that requires separate cloning/sequencing reactions and is, therefore, often incomplete in genomic databases. Comparison of DPP sequences from at least one member of each major branch in the mammalian evolutionary tree (including some ""toothless"" mammals) as well as one reptile and bird may help delineate its possible functions in both dentin and ductal epithelia. RESULTS: The BMP1-cleavage and translation-termination domains were sufficiently conserved to permit amplification/cloning/sequencing of most species' DPP. While the integrin-binding domain, RGD, was present in about half of species, only vestigial remnants of this tripeptide were identified in the others. The number of tandem repeats of the nominal SerSerAsp phosphorylation motif in toothed mammals (including baleen whale and platypus which lack teeth as adults), ranged from approximately 75 (elephant) to >230 (human). These repeats were not perfect, however, and patterns of intervening sequences highlight the rapidity of changes among even closely related species. Two toothless anteater species have evolved different sets of nonsense mutations shortly after their BMP1 motifs suggesting that while cleavage may be important for DSPP processing in other tissues, the DPP domain itself may be required only in dentin. The lizard DSPP had an intact BMP1 site, a remnant RGD motif, as well as a distinctly different Ser/Asp-rich domain compared to mammals. CONCLUSIONS: The DPP domain of DSPP was found to change dramatically within mammals and was lost in two truly toothless animals. The defining aspect of DPP, the long repeating phosphorylation domain, apparently undergoes frequent slip replication and recombination events that rapidly change specific patterns but not its overall biochemical character in toothed animals. Species may have to co-evolve protein processing mechanisms, however, to handle increased lengths of DSP repeats. While the RGD domain is lost in many species, some evolutionary pressure to maintain integrin binding can be observed.

"The nymph of the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) is an important bridging vector of the Lyme disease spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi) to humans in the far-western United States. The previously unknown dispersal capabilities of this life stage were studied in relation to logs, tree trunks, and adjacent leaf-litter areas in a mixed hardwood forest using mark-release-recapture methods. In two spatially and temporally well-spaced trials involving logs, the estimated mean distances that nymphs dispersed ranged from approximately 0.04 to 0.20 m/day on logs vs 0.11 to 0.72 m/day in litter. Prior to recapture in either trial and within the confines of the sampling grids, the greatest estimated dispersal distances by individual nymphs released on logs, and in litter 0.5 m or 1.5 m from logs, were 2.4, 3.0, and 3.0 m, respectively. Nymphs released on logs or litter tended to remain within the same biotopes in which they were freed while host-seeking. In two simultaneous trials involving trunks spaced close-at-hand, nymphs released at the trunk/litter interface on all four aspects collectively dispersed a mean of 0.353 m/day on trunks vs 0.175 m/day in litter. In either trial, the greatest distances that recaptured nymphs climbed trunks, or dispersed in litter in an encircling 3-m grid, were 1.55 m and 2.97 m, respectively. Nymphs ascending trunks did not exhibit a preference for any one aspect, and the B. burgdorferi-infection prevalences in nymphs that climbed trunks (3.2-4.0%) did not differ significantly from those that moved horizontally into litter (10.5-17.6%). We conclude that I. pacificus nymphs use an ambush host-seeking strategy; that they disperse slowly in all biotopes studied; that they usually continue to host-seek in or on whatever substratum they access initially; and that B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs are as likely to move horizontally as vertically when offered a choice.

"Actin polymerization in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane is locally regulated by actin nucleators. Several microbial pathogens exploit cellular actin polymerization to spread through tissue. The movement of the enteric pathogen Shigella flexneri, both within the cell body and from cell to cell, depends on actin polymerization. During intercellular spread, actin polymerization at the bacterial surface generates protrusions of the plasma membrane, which are engulfed by adjacent cells. In the cell body, polymerization of actin by Shigella spp. is dependent on N-WASP activation of the Arp2/Arp3 complex. Here we demonstrate that, in contrast, efficient protrusion formation and intercellular spread depend on actin polymerization that involves activation of the Diaphanous formin Dia. While the Shigella virulence protein IpgB2 can bind and activate Dia1 (N. M. Alto et al., Cell 124:133-145, 2006), its absence does not result in a detectable defect in Dia-dependent protrusion formation or spread. The dependence on the activation of Dia during S. flexneri infection contrasts with the inhibition of this pathway observed during vaccinia virus infection.

"Human interleukin-24 (IL-24) is unique among the IL-10 superfamily as there is considerable evidence that it possesses multiple anti-cancer properties, including direct tumor cell cytotoxicity, helper T cell (TH1) immune stimulation, and anti-angiogenic activities. The primary sequence of human IL-24 differs from homologous cytokines, because it possesses three consensus N-linked glycosylation sites and the potential for a single disulfide bond. To address the significance of these modifications in human IL-24, we analyzed the relationship between post-translational modifications and the cytokine activity of the human IL-24 protein. In contrast to related interleukins, we identified a relationship between net glycosylation, protein solubility, and cytokine activity. In addition, abrogation of the two cysteine residues by mutagenesis dramatically altered the ability of IL-24 to secrete from host cells and resulted in the concomitant loss of IL-24 activity. We conclude that, unlike other IL-10 family members, human IL-24 must be glycosylated to maintain solubility and bioavailability. Further, a single, unique disulfide bond is required for secretion and activity. These structure-function relationships show that, although IL-24 is a member of the IL-19 subfamily of IL-10-like cytokines by sequence similarity, its surface properties and its distinctive disulfide arrangement make it unique. These observations could explain the novel biological activities measured of this cytokine. Understanding the structural basis of IL-24 activity will be important in the interpretation of the function of this cytokine and in the development of scale-up strategies for biophysical and clinical applications.

"Pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43, TARDBP, have been reported in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) and, more recently, in families with a heterogeneous clinical phenotype including both ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). In our previous study, sequencing analyses identified one variant in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the TARDBP gene in two affected members of one family with bvFTD and ALS and in one unrelated clinically assessed case of FALS. Since that study, brain tissue has become available and provides autopsy confirmation of FTLD-TDP in the proband and ALS in the brother of the bvFTD-ALS family and the neuropathology of those two cases is reported here. The 3'-UTR variant was not found in 982 control subjects (1,964 alleles). To determine the functional significance of this variant, we undertook quantitative gene expression analysis. Allele-specific amplification showed a significant increase of 22% (P < 0.05) in disease-specific allele expression with a twofold increase in total TARDBP mRNA. The segregation of this variant in a family with clinical bvFTD and ALS adds to the spectrum of clinical phenotypes previously associated with TARDBP variants. In summary, TARDBP variants may result in clinically and neuropathologically heterogeneous phenotypes linked by a common molecular pathology called TDP-43 proteinopathy.

"Tumor suppressor p53 regulates the expression of p53-induced genes (PIG) that trigger apoptosis. PIG3 or TP53I3 is the only known member of the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily induced by p53 and is used as a proapoptotic marker. Although the participation of PIG3 in the apoptotic pathway is proven, the protein and its mechanism of action were never characterized. We analyzed human PIG3 enzymatic function and found NADPH-dependent reductase activity with ortho-quinones, which is consistent with the classification of PIG3 in the quinone oxidoreductase family. However, the activity is much lower than that of zeta-crystallin, a better known quinone oxidoreductase. In addition, we report the crystallographic structure of PIG3, which allowed the identification of substrate- and cofactor-binding sites, with residues fully conserved from bacteria to human. Tyr-59 in zeta-crystallin (Tyr-51 in PIG3) was suggested to participate in the catalysis of quinone reduction. However, kinetics of Tyr/Phe and Tyr/Ala mutants of both enzymes demonstrated that the active site Tyr is not catalytic but may participate in substrate binding, consistent with a mechanism based on propinquity effects. It has been proposed that PIG3 contribution to apoptosis would be through oxidative stress generation. We found that in vitro activity and in vivo overexpression of PIG3 accumulate reactive oxygen species. Accordingly, an inactive PIG3 mutant (S151V) did not produce reactive oxygen species in cells, indicating that enzymatically active protein is necessary for this function. This supports that PIG3 action is through oxidative stress produced by its enzymatic activity and provides essential knowledge for eventual control of apoptosis.

"Animals have the ability to respond to threatening situations with sets of defensive behaviors. This review demonstrates that defensive behaviors change during early life in mammals. First, unlearned responses are reorganized during early ontogeny and expressed in an age-specific way. Second, the expression of defensive responses is influenced by early experience prior to the first encounter with a threat. Third, once animals have been exposed to a threatening stimulus they subsequently modify their behavior. The neural bases of defensive behavior and the processes that alter them during development are discussed. Maturation of components and connections of the fear circuit seem to contribute to changes in unlearned fear responses. Early experience and learning modify these developmental processes and shape the expression of defensive behavior. Continuous reorganization of the neural substrate and defensive behavior during ontogeny seems to allow the animal to adjust to the conditions it encounters at a given age in a given environment. It is proposed that the developmental changes in defensive behavior can be conceptualized as phenotypic plasticity.

"The mos protooncogene has opposing effects on cell cycle progression. It is required for reinitiation of meiotic maturation and for meiotic progression through metaphase II, yet it is an active component of cytostatic factor. mos is a potent oncogene in fibroblasts, but high levels of expression are lethal. The lethality of mos gene expression in mammalian cells could be a consequence of a blockage induced by its cytostatic factor-related activity, which may appear at high dosage in mitotic cells. We have directly tested whether expression of the Mos protein can block mitosis in mammalian cells by microinjecting a fusion protein between Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein and Xenopus c-Mos into PtK1 epithelial cells and analyzing the cells by video time-lapse and immunofluorescence microscopy. Time-course analyses showed that Mos blocked mitosis by preventing progression to a normal metaphase. Chromosomes frequently failed to attain a bipolar orientation and were found near one pole. Injection of a kinase-deficient mutant Mos had no effect on mitosis, indicating that the blockage of mitotic progression required Mos kinase activity. Antitubulin immunostaining of cells blocked by Mos showed that microtubules were present but that spindle morphology was abnormal. Immunostaining for the Mos fusion protein showed that both wild-type and kinase mutant proteins localized at the kinetochores. Our results suggest that mitotic blockage by Mos may result from an action of the Mos kinase on the kinetochores, thus increasing chromosome instability and preventing normal congression.

"Segments of DNA are deleted from recombinant cosmid DNAs with high frequency during propagation in standard recA Escherichia coli hosts. An attempt has been made to derive an appropriate strain of E. coli, suitable for cosmid cloning, in which such deletions do not occur. We examined the effects of a series of host recombinational mutations on the deletion process, using six independent recombinant cosmids that carry inserts of mouse, Chinese hamster, or human DNA. Various E. coli host cells carrying the recombinant cosmids were cultured serially in liquid medium, and the recombinant cosmid DNAs were extracted from the host cells and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and by gene transfer of the DNAs into cultured mammalian cells. Of the mutations examined, only a recB recC sbcB recJ (or recN) quadruple combination of host mutations prevented the deletion of DNA segments. The recombinant cosmid DNAs propagated in E. coli hosts that carried this combination of mutations were functionally as well as structurally intact. We propose that the recJ (and/or recN) gene is involved in some aspect of the events that lead to deletions of cosmid DNA in a recB recC sbcB genetic background.

"The linear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Tetrahymena malaccensis has tandem 52-base-pair repeats at its telomeres. The mtDNA has a multimodal distribution of telomeres. Different groups in the distribution have different numbers of telomeric repeats. The standard deviation of the size of each end group is independent of the mean size of the end group. The two sides of the mtDNA have different multimodal distributions of repeats. Cloned cell lines have multimodal distributions of mtDNA telomeres distinct from that of the original cell line. The number of telomere end groups and the average size of the end groups change in an erratic fashion as the cells are passaged and do not reach a stable equilibrium distribution in 185 generations. We propose that the mean size of a telomere end group and the size distribution of an end group are independently regulated. The system controlling the average size of end groups may be defective in T. malaccensis, since a closely related species (T. thermophila) does not have a multimodal distribution of mtDNA telomeres. T. hyperangularis, which has different telomeric repeats on each side of its mtDNA, has a multimodal distribution of mtDNA telomeres on only one side, suggesting that the mechanism controlling the average number of repeats in an end group can be sequence specific. These mitochondrial telomeres provide a new example of the more general phenomenon of expansion and contraction of arrays of repeated sequences seen, for example, with simple-sequence ""satellite"" DNAs; however, the mitochondrial telomeres change on a very short time scale.

"In this review we have attempted a comprehensive compilation of the cardiac morphologic changes that occur in spontaneous and experimental myocardial diseases of animals. Our coverage addresses diseases of mammals and birds and includes these diseases found in both domesticated and wild animals. A similar review of the myocardial diseases in this broad range of animal species has not been attempted previously. We have summarized and illustrated the gross, microscopic, and ultrastructural alterations for these myocardial diseases; and, whenever possible, we have reviewed their biochemical pathogenesis. We have arranged the myocardial diseases for presentation and discussion according to an etiologic classification with seven categories. These include a group of idiopathic or primary cardiomyopathies recognized in man (hypertrophic, dilated, and restrictive types) and a large group of secondary cardiomyopathies with known causes, such as inherited tendency; nutritional deficiency; toxicity; physical injury and shock; endocrine disorders, and myocarditides of viral, bacterial, and protozoal causation. Considerable overlap exists between each of the etiologic groups in the spectrum of pathologic alterations seen in the myocardium. These include various degenerative changes, myocyte necrosis, and inflammatory lesions. However, some diseases show rather characteristic myocardial alterations such as vacuolar degeneration in anthracycline cardiotoxicity, myofibrillar lysis in furazolidone cardiotoxicity, calcification in calcinosis of mice, glycogen accumulation in the glycogenoses, lipofuscinosis in cattle, fatty degeneration in erucic acid cardiotoxicity, myofiber disarray in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and lymphocytic inflammation with inclusion bodies in canine parvoviral myocarditis. The myocardial diseases represent the largest group in the spectrum of spontaneous cardiac diseases of animals. Pericardial and endocardial diseases and congential cardiac diseases are seen less frequently; and, in contrast to man, coronary artery disease and myocardial ischemia are rather infrequent in animals. The present review shows clearly that the spectrum of myocardial diseases in animals is enlarging and that many newly recognized diseases are emerging and assuming considerable importance. For example, various heritable cardiomyopathies have recently been described in the KK mouse, cattle, and rats. Increasingly recognized myocardial diseases include cardiomyopathies in cats, dogs, and birds; anthracycline cardiotoxicity; furazolidone cardiotoxicity; ionophore cardiotoxicity; myocardial damage associated with central nervous system injuries; myocardial hypertrophy in

"The intranuclear distribution of nuclear matrix-associated protein p107 and the 28-kD Sm antigen of U-snRNPs have been studied using double-label immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase electron microscopy. In interphase nuclei of HeLa cells, Novikoff hepatoma cells, and rat kangaroo kidney cells, p107 was confined to discrete interchromatin domains. The domains had an irregular contour, with an average diameter of 1-1.5 micron. Each domain appeared to be composed of interconnected granules. The Sm antigen colocalized and appeared concentrated in these domains but also showed some general nucleoplasmic distribution. During mitosis, the interchromatin domains disassembled such that the Sm portion redistributed to the perichromosomal and spindle regions and the p107 component redistributed throughout the mitotic cytoplasm. During anaphase, p107 assembled into discrete clusters throughout the mitotic cytoplasm. The Sm antigen was not a component of these clusters. Double-label immunofluorescence with anti-p107 and the anti-DNA tight-binding protein, AhNa1, showed that the extranuclear p107 domains assumed an interchromatin localization only after the chromosomes had decondensed. The correlation between chromosome decondensation and the occurrence of p107 within interchromatin domains was also observed during chicken erythrocyte nuclear reactivation. We propose that the discrete interchromatin domains that contain p107 and p28 may be important for processing and splicing of RNA and that their structural assembly within nuclei is sensitive to the presence of the transcriptionally active conformation of chromatin.

"A rat monoclonal antibody against yeast alpha-tubulin (clone YL 1/2; Kilmartin, J. V., B. Wright, and C. Milstein, 1982, J. Cell Biol., 93:576-582) that reacts specifically with the tyrosylated form of alpha-tubulin and readily binds to tubulin in microtubules when injected into cultured cells (see Wehland, J., M. C. Willingham, and I. V. Sandoval, 1983, J. Cell Biol., 97:1467-1475) was used to study microtubule organization and function in living cells. Depending on the concentration of YL 1/2 that was injected the following striking effects were observed: (a) When injected at a low concentration (2 mg IgG/ml in the injection solution), where microtubules were decorated without changing their distribution, intracellular movement of cell organelles (saltatory movement) and cell translocation were not affected. Intermediate concentrations (6 mg IgG/ml) that induced bundling but no perinuclear aggregation of microtubules abolished saltatory movement and cell translocation, and high concentrations (greater than 12 mg IgG/ml) that induced perinuclear aggregation of microtubules showed the same effect. (b) YL 1/2, when injected at intermediate and high concentrations, arrested cells in mitosis. Such cells showed no normal spindle structures. (c) Injection of an intermediate concentration of YL 1/2 that stopped saltatory movement caused little or no aggregation of intermediate filaments and no dispersion of the Golgi complex. After injection of high concentrations, resulting in perinuclear aggregation of microtubules, intermediate filaments formed perinuclear bundles and the Golgi complex became dispersed analogous to results obtained after treatment of cells with colcemid. (d) When rhodamine-conjugated YL 1/2 was injected at concentrations that stopped saltatory movement and arrested cells in mitosis, microtubule structures could be visualized and followed for several hours in living cells by video image intensification microscopy. They showed little or no change in distribution and organization during observation, even though these microtubule structures appeared not to be stabilized by injected YL 1/2 since they were readily depolymerized by colcemid or cold treatment and repolymerized upon drug removal or rewarming to 37 degrees C, respectively. These results are discussed in terms of the participation of microtubules in cellular activities such as cell movement and cytoplasmic organization and in terms of the specificity of YL 1/2 for the tyrosylated form of alpha-tubulin.

"The replicative life spans of mammalian fibroblasts in vitro were studied in a number of cell cultures representing eight species. Emphasis was placed on determining the population doubling level at which phase III (a period of decrease in the rate of proliferation) and chromosomal alterations occur. All the cell cultures studied went through a growth crisis, a period of apparent growth cessation lasting for at least 2 weeks. In most cultures, the crisis represented the end of their replicative capacities, but in some cultures cell proliferation was resumed after the crisis. A predominantly diploid chromosome constitution (more than 75%) was demonstrated prior to the growth crisis. In cultures in which cell proliferation was resumed after the crisis, a nondiploid constitution prevailed in all cases except the rat (with 90% or more diploid cells all the time). The growth crisis occurred at population doubling levels that were characteristic for the species and was shown to be related to the species' maximal life span by a strict power law, being proportional to the square root of the maximal life span. Based on data in the literature, the same relationship was also valid for the lifespans of circulating mammalian erythrocytes in vivo. These results may indicate the prevalence of a common functional basis regulating the life span of fibroblasts and erythrocytes and thus operating in replicative as well as postmitotic cells in vitro and in vivo.

"The regulation of DNA replication at a subchromosomal level in mammalian cells has been investigated. DNA fiber autoradiographs were prepared from mouse L-929 cells pulse labeled with (3H)thymidine. Initiation events and subsequent chain growth occurring over short stretches (up to three replication units in length) of chromosomal DNA were analyzed. The results show that adjacent units usually initiate replication synchronously and that this synchrony is related to the proximity of initiation sites. In addition, adjacent units are of similar size and the rates of replication fork progression within units and on adjacent units are similar. The rate of fork progression increases with increasing replication unit size. Finally, no evidence for fixed termination sites for the units has been found. These observations suggest that despite large variations in size of replication units, timing of initiation events, and rates of fork progression found in chromosomal DNA as a whole, these processes are closely regulated within subchromosomal clusters of active replication units.

"The sequence of the highly repetitive satellite HS-beta DNA fraction from kangaroo rat Dipodomys ordii was determined independently by RNA and DNA sequencing techniques. A basic iterated sequence of 10 nucleotides with several mutational variations was found. Base-composition data are consistent with the proposed sequence and revealed a high content of 5-methylcytosine. DNA and RNA sequencing techniques used gave identical results, showing that the fidelity of synthesis of riboguanidine-substituted DNA under our conditions is adequate for nucleotide sequence studies.

"In Colombia, little is known on the distribution of the Asian mosquito Aedes albopictus, main vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Asia and Oceania. Therefore, this work sought to estimate its current and future potential geographic distribution under the Representative Concentration Paths (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 emission scenarios by 2050 and 2070, using ecological niche models. For this, predictions were made in MaxEnt, employing occurrences of A. albopictus from their native area and South America and bioclimatic variables of these places. We found that, from their invasion of Colombia to the most recent years, A. albopictus is present in 47% of the country, in peri-urban (20%), rural (23%), and urban (57%) areas between 0 and 1800 m, with Antioquia and Valle del Cauca being the departments with most of the records. Our ecological niche modelling for the currently suggests that A. albopictus is distributed in 96% of the Colombian continental surface up to 3000 m (p < 0.001) putting at risk at least 48 million of people that could be infected by the arboviruses that this species transmits. Additionally, by 2050 and 2070, under RCP 2.6 scenario, its distribution could cover to nearly 90% of continental extension up to 3100 m (≈55 million of people at risk), while under RCP 8.5 scenario, it could decrease below 60% of continental extension, but expand upward to 3200 m (< 38 million of people at risk). These results suggest that, currently in Colombia, A. albopictus is found throughout the country and climate change could diminish eventually its area of distribution, but increase its altitudinal range. In Colombia, surveillance and vector control programs must focus their attention on this vector to avoid complications in the national public health setting.

"Neurological disorders represent an important sanitary and economic threat for the equine industry worldwide. Among nervous diseases, viral encephalitis is of growing concern, due to the emergence of arboviruses and to the high contagiosity of herpesvirus-infected horses. The nature, severity and duration of the clinical signs could be different depending on the etiological agent and its virulence. However, definite diagnosis generally requires the implementation of combinations of direct and/or indirect screening assays in specialized laboratories. The equine practitioner, involved in a mission of prevention and surveillance, plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis of viral encephalitis. The general management of the horse is essentially supportive, focused on controlling pain and inflammation within the central nervous system, preventing injuries and providing supportive care. Despite its high medical relevance and economic impact in the equine industry, vaccines are not always available and there is no specific antiviral therapy. In this review, the major virological, clinical and epidemiological features of the main neuropathogenic viruses inducing encephalitis in equids in Europe, including rabies virus (Rhabdoviridae), Equid herpesviruses (Herpesviridae), Borna disease virus (Bornaviridae) and West Nile virus (Flaviviridae), as well as exotic viruses, will be presented.

"Contemporary patterns of land use and global climate change are modifying regional pools of parasite host species. The impact of host community changes on human disease risk, however, is difficult to assess due to a lack of information about zoonotic parasite host assemblages. We have used a recently developed method to infer parasite-host interactions for Chagas Disease (CD) from vector-host co-occurrence networks. Vector-host networks were constructed to analyze topological characteristics of the network and ecological traits of species' nodes, which could provide information regarding parasite regional dispersal in Mexico. Twenty-eight triatomine species (vectors) and 396 mammal species (potential hosts) were included using a data-mining approach to develop models to infer most-likely interactions. The final network contained 1,576 links which were analyzed to calculate centrality, connectivity, and modularity. The model predicted links of independently registered Trypanosoma cruzi hosts, which correlated with the degree of parasite-vector co-occurrence. Wiring patterns differed according to node location, while edge density was greater in Neotropical as compared to Nearctic regions. Vectors with greatest public health importance (i.e., Triatoma dimidiata, T. barberi, T. pallidipennis, T. longipennis, etc), did not have stronger links with particular host species, although they had a greater frequency of significant links. In contrast, hosts classified as important based on network properties were synanthropic mammals. The latter were the most common parasite hosts and are likely bridge species between these communities, thereby integrating meta-community scenarios beneficial for long-range parasite dispersal. This was particularly true for rodents, >50% of species are synanthropic and more than 20% have been identified as T. cruzi hosts. In addition to predicting potential host species using the co-occurrence networks, they reveal regions with greater expected parasite mobility. The Neotropical region, which includes the Mexican south and southeast, and the Transvolcanic belt, had greatest potential active T. cruzi dispersal, as well as greatest edge density. This information could be directly applied for stratification of transmission risk and to design and analyze human-infected vector contact intervention efficacy.

"A reduction in body temperature can be achieved by a downward adjustment of the termoneutral zone, a process also described as anapyrexia. Pharmacological induction of anapyrexia could enable numerous applications in medicine. However, little is known about the potential of pharmacological agents to induce anapyrexic signaling. Therefore, a review of literature was performed and over a thousand pharmacologically active compounds were analyzed for their ability to induce anapyrexia in animals. Based on this analysis, eight agents (helium, dimethyl sulfoxide, reserpine, (oxo)tremorine, pentobarbital, (chlor) promazine, insulin, and acetaminophen) were identified as potential anapyrexia-inducing compounds and discussed in detail. The translational pitfalls were also addressed for each candidate compound. Of the agents that were discussed, reserpine, (oxo)tremorine, and (chlor) promazine may possess true anapyrexic properties based on their ability to either affect the thermoneutral zone or its effectors and facilitate hypothermic signaling. However, these properties are currently not unequivocal and warrant further examination in the context of artificially-induced hypometabolism.

"Coccidioidomycosis consists of a spectrum of disease, ranging from a mild, self-limited, febrile illness to severe, life-threatening infection. It is caused by the soil-dwelling fungi, Coccidioides immitis and C. posadasii, which are present in diverse endemic areas. Climate changes and environmental factors affect the Coccidioides lifecycle and influence infection rates. The incidence of coccidioidomycosis has risen substantially over the past two decades. The vast majority of Coccidioides infections occur in the endemic zones, such as California, Arizona, Mexico, and Central America. Infections occurring outside those zones appear to be increasingly common, and pose unique clinical and public health challenges. It has long been known that elderly persons, pregnant women, and members of certain ethnic groups are at risk for severe or disseminated coccidioidomycosis. In recent years, it has become evident that persons with immunodeficiency diseases, diabetics, transplant recipients, and prisoners are also particularly vulnerable.

"Arboreal mammals navigate a highly three dimensional and discontinuous habitat. Among arboreal mammals, squirrels demonstrate impressive agility. In a recent ""viral"" YouTube video, unsuspecting squirrels were mechanically catapulted off of a track, inducing an initially uncontrolled rotation of the body. Interestingly, they skillfully stabilized themselves using tail motion, which ultimately allowed the squirrels to land successfully. Here we analyze the mechanism by which the squirrels recover from large body angular rates. We analyzed from the video that squirrels first use their tail to help stabilizing their head to visually fix a landing site. Then the tail starts to rotate to help stabilizing the body, preparing themselves for landing. To analyze further the mechanism of this tail use during mid-air, we built a multibody squirrel model and showed the righting strategy based on body inertia moment changes and active angular momentum transfer between axes. To validate the hypothesized strategy, we made a squirrel-like robot and demonstrated a fall-stabilizing experiment. Our results demonstrate that a squirrel's long tail, despite comprising just 3% of body mass, can inertially stabilize a rapidly rotating body. This research contributes to better understanding the importance of long tails for righting mechanisms in animals living in complex environments such as trees.

"Emerging diseases of zoonotic origin such as COVID-19 are a continuing public health threat in China that lead to a significant socioeconomic burden. This study reviewed the current laws and regulations, government reports and policy documents, and existing literature on zoonotic disease preparedness and prevention across the forestry, agriculture, and public health authorities in China, to articulate the current landscape of potential risks, existing mandates, and gaps. A total of 55 known zoonotic diseases (59 pathogens) are routinely monitored under a multi-sectoral system among humans and domestic and wild animals in China. These diseases have been detected in wild mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish or other aquatic animals, the majority of which are transmitted between humans and animals via direct or indirect contact and vectors. However, this current monitoring system covers a limited scope of disease threats and animal host species, warranting expanded review for sources of disease and pathogen with zoonotic potential. In addition, the governance of wild animal protection and utilization and limited knowledge about wild animal trade value chains present challenges for zoonotic disease risk assessment and monitoring, and affect the completeness of mandates and enforcement. A coordinated and collaborative mechanism among different departments is required for the effective monitoring and management of disease emergence and transmission risks in the animal value chains. Moreover, pathogen surveillance among wild animal hosts and human populations outside of the routine monitoring system will fill the data gaps and improve our understanding of future emerging zoonotic threats to achieve disease prevention. The findings and recommendations will advance One Health collaboration across government and non-government stakeholders to optimize monitoring and surveillance, risk management, and emergency responses to known and novel zoonotic threats, and support COVID-19 recovery efforts.

"We report the first functionally-annotated de novo transcriptome assembly for North American flying squirrels (genus Glaucomys). RNA was extracted from tissue samples obtained from two northern flying squirrels and two southern flying squirrels sampled from Ontario, Canada, and sequenced on an Illumina paired-end sequencing platform. We reconstructed 702,228 Glaucomys transcripts using 193,323,120 sequence read pairs and captured sequence homologies, protein domains, and gene function classifications. Introgressive hybridization between northern (Glaucomys sabrinus) and southern flying squirrels (G. volans) has been observed in some areas of North America. However, existing molecular markers lack the resolution to discriminate late-generation introgressants and describe the extent to which hybridization influences the Glaucomys gene pool. These genomic resources can increase the resolution of molecular techniques used to examine the dynamics of the Glaucomys hybrid zone.

"Cooperative research that addresses infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigations relies heavily on availability and effective use of appropriate diagnostic tools, including serological and molecular assays, as exemplified by the current COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we stress the importance of using these assays to support collaborative epidemiological studies to assess risk of rickettsial disease outbreaks among international partner countries. Workforce development, mentorship, and training are important components in building laboratory capability and capacity to assess risk of and mitigate emerging disease outbreaks. International partnerships that fund cooperative research through mentoring and on-the-job training are successful examples for enhancing infectious disease surveillance. Cooperative research studies between the Naval Medical Research Center's Rickettsial Diseases Research Program (RDRP) and 17 institutes from nine countries among five continents were conducted to address the presence of and the risk for endemic rickettsial diseases. To establish serological and molecular assays in the collaborative institutes, initial training and continued material, and technical support were provided by RDRP. The laboratory methods used in the research studies to detect and identify the rickettsial infections included (1) group-specific IgM and IgG serological assays and (2) molecular assays. Twenty-six cooperative research projects performed between 2008 and 2020 enhanced the capability and capacity of 17 research institutes to estimate risk of rickettsial diseases. These international collaborative studies have led to the recognition and/or confirmation of rickettsial diseases within each of the partner countries. In addition, with the identification of specific pathogen and non-pathogen Rickettsia species, a more accurate risk assessment could be made in surveillance studies using environmental samples. The discoveries from these projects reinforced international cooperation benefiting not only the partner countries but also the scientific community at large through presentations (n = 40) at international scientific meetings and peer-reviewed publications (n = 18). The cooperative research studies conducted in multiple international institutes led to the incorporation of new SOPs and trainings for laboratory procedures; biosafety, biosurety, and biosecurity methods; performance of rickettsia-specific assays; and the identification of known and unknown rickettsial agents through the introduction of new serologic and molecular assays that complemented traditional microbiology methods.

"Borrelia miyamotoi, a bacterium that causes relapsing fever, is found in ixodid ticks throughout the northern hemisphere. The first cases of human infection with B. miyamotoi were identified in 2011. In the eastern USA, blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) become infected by feeding on an infected vertebrate host, or through transovarial transmission. We surveyed B. miyamotoi prevalence in ticks within forested habitats in Dutchess County, New York, and identified possible reservoir hosts. To assess spatial variation in infection, we collected questing nymphal ticks at > 150 sites. To assess temporal variation in infection, we collected questing nymphs for 8 years at a single study site. We collected questing larval ticks from nine plots to estimate the amount of transovarial transmission. To evaluate potential reservoir hosts, we captured 14 species of mammal and bird hosts naturally infested with larval blacklegged ticks and held these hosts in the laboratory until ticks fed to repletion and molted to nymphs. We determined infection for all ticks using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The overall infection prevalence of questing nymphal ticks across all sites was ~ 1%, but prevalence at individual sites was as high as 9.1%. We detected no significant increase in infection through time. Only 0.4% of questing larval ticks were infected. Ticks having fed as larvae from short-tailed shrews, red squirrels, and opossums tended to have higher infection prevalence than did ticks having fed on other hosts. Further studies of the role of hosts in transmission are warranted. The locally high prevalence of B. miyamotoi in the New York/New England landscape suggests the importance of vigilance by health practitioners and the public.

"Flea-borne typhus, due to Rickettsia typhi and R. felis, is an infection causing fever, headache, rash, and diverse organ manifestations that can result in critical illness or death. This is the second part of a two-part series describing the rise, decline, and resurgence of flea-borne typhus (FBT) in the United States over the last century. These studies illustrate the influence of historical events, social conditions, technology, and public health interventions on the prevalence of a vector-borne disease. Flea-borne typhus was an emerging disease, primarily in the Southern USA and California, from 1910 to 1945. The primary reservoirs in this period were the rats Rattus norvegicus and Ra. rattus and the main vector was the Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis). The period 1930 to 1945 saw a dramatic rise in the number of reported cases. This was due to conditions favorable to the proliferation of rodents and their fleas during the Depression and World War II years, including: dilapidated, overcrowded housing; poor environmental sanitation; and the difficulty of importing insecticides and rodenticides during wartime. About 42,000 cases were reported between 1931-1946, and the actual number of cases may have been three-fold higher. The number of annual cases of FBT peaked in 1944 at 5401 cases. American involvement in World War II, in the short term, further perpetuated the epidemic of FBT by the increased production of food crops in the American South and by promoting crowded and unsanitary conditions in the Southern cities. However, ultimately, World War II proved to be a powerful catalyst in the control of FBT by improving standards of living and providing the tools for typhus control, such as synthetic insecticides and novel rodenticides. A vigorous program for the control of FBT was conducted by the US Public Health Service from 1945 to 1952, using insecticides, rodenticides, and environmental sanitation and remediation. Government programs and relative economic prosperity in the South also resulted in slum clearance and improved housing, which reduced rodent harborage. By 1956, the number of cases of FBT in the United States had dropped dramatically to only 98. Federally funded projects for rat control continued until the mid-1980s. Effective antibiotics for FBT, such as the tetracyclines, came into clinical practice in the late 1940s. The first diagnostic test for FBT, the Weil-Felix test, was found to have inadequate sensitivity and specificity and was replaced by complement fixation in the 1940s and the indirect fluorescent antibody test in the 1980s. A second organism causing FBT, R. felis, was discovered in 1990. Flea-borne typhus persists in the United States, primarily in South and Central Texas, the Los Angeles area, and Hawaii. In the former two areas, the opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and cats have replaced rats as the primary reservoirs, with the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) now as the most important vector. In Hawaii, 73% of cases occur in Maui County because it has lower rainfall than other areas. Despite great successes against FBT in the post-World War II era, it has proved difficult to eliminate because it is now associated with our companion animals, stray pets, opossums, and the cat flea, an abundant and non-selective vector. In the new millennium, cases of FBT are increasing in Texas and California. In 2018-2019, Los Angeles County experienced a resurgence of FBT, with rats as the reservoir.

"Genetically specific interactions between hosts and parasites can lead to coevolutionary fluctuations in their genotype frequencies over time. Such fluctuating selection dynamics are, however, expected to occur only under specific circumstances (e.g., high fitness costs of infection to the hosts). The outcomes of host-parasite interactions are typically affected by environmental/ecological factors, which could modify coevolutionary dynamics. For instance, individual hosts are often infected with more than one parasite species and interactions between them can alter host and parasite performance. We examined the potential effects of coinfections by genetically specific (i.e., coevolving) and nonspecific (i.e., generalist) parasite species on fluctuating selection dynamics using numerical simulations. We modeled coevolution (a) when hosts are exposed to a single parasite species that must genetically match the host to infect, (b) when hosts are also exposed to a generalist parasite that increases fitness costs to the hosts, and (c) when coinfecting parasites compete for the shared host resources. Our results show that coinfections can enhance fluctuating selection dynamics when they increase fitness costs to the hosts. Under resource competition, coinfections can either enhance or suppress fluctuating selection dynamics, depending on the characteristics (i.e., fecundity, fitness costs induced to the hosts) of the interacting parasites.

"BACKGROUND: Enterocytozoon bieneusi is the most frequently detected microsporidian species in humans and animals. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, no information on E. bieneusi infection in Himalayan marmots (Marmota himalayana) and Alashan ground squirrels (Spermophilus alashanicus) is available worldwide. The aim of the present study was to understand the occurrence and genetic characterizations of E. bieneusi in Himalayan marmots and Alashan ground squirrels in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau area (QTPA), Gansu Province, China. METHODS: A total of 498 intestinal contents were collected from 399 Himalayan marmots and 99 Alashan ground squirrels in QTPA. These samples were screened for the presence of E. bieneusi by using nested polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. The ITS-positive sequences were aligned and phylogenetically analyzed to determine the genotypes of E. bieneusi. RESULTS: The average infection rate of E. bieneusi was 10.0% (50/498), with 11.8% (47/399) in Himalayan marmots and 3.0% (3/99) in Alashan ground squirrels. A total of 7 distinct E. bieneusi genotypes were confirmed: 1 known genotype, YAK1 (n = 18) and 6 novel genotypes, named as ZY37 (n = 27), HN39 (n = 1), HN96 (n = 1), SN45 (n = 1), XH47 (n = 1) and ZY83 (n = 1). All the genotypes obtained in the present study were classified into group 1. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. bieneusi in Himalayan marmots and Alashan ground squirrels in China. The identification of genotype YAK1 in the two rodent species expanded the host range of this genotype. All the seven genotypes were clustered into zoonotic group 1, suggesting that these animal species can be potential epidemiological vectors of zoonotic microsporidiosis caused by E. bieneusi and pose a threat to ecological security. It is necessary to strengthen management practices and surveillance in the investigated areas to reduce the risk of E. bieneusi infection from the two rodent species to humans.

"The cardiac puncture technique for obtaining relatively large volume (50-150 µL) blood samples from sedated rodents has been used in research for nearly a century. Historically, its use to phlebotomize and then release live rodents was more common. However, recently its use in a non-terminal capacity frequently imparts negative connotations in part because exsanguination of sedated animals via cardiac puncture is now an American Veterinary Medical Association-approved euthanasia technique. This association has resulted in ethical concerns by manuscript reviewers and in a few instances, outright refusal by some peer-reviewed journals to publish research that utilized the technique. To counter the perceived negative associations with its non-terminal use, we summarized nearly two decades (2001-2019) of capture and handling data throughout Connecticut, resulting in over 7000 cardiac punctures performed on nearly 5000 sedated, live-captured and released Peromyscus spp. We show that our total handling mortality rate (3.7%) was comparable, if not lower, than similar field studies that utilized other phlebotomy techniques. Many public health, integrated tick management, and vector-borne disease ecology studies require samples from individual wild-caught Peromyscus spp. over time to determine intervention efficacy and pathogen infection monitoring, and in such field studies, post-operative care is not an option. Proper execution of cardiac puncture does not increase susceptibility of individuals to predation upon release as can potential ocular abnormalities or infections that can occur as the result of use of other techniques. We posit that neither exsanguination nor resulting euthanasia are requirements of cardiac puncture and that its use is entirely appropriate for obtaining blood samples from live-captured and released Peromyscus spp. Properly performed cardiac puncture is an excellent technique to obtain blood samples from sedated, individual Peromyscus spp. on multiple appropriately-spaced occasions over single trapping seasons while keeping animal welfare a top priority.

"Typhus group rickettsioses (TGRs) are vector-borne diseases that include murine typhus (Rickettsia typhi) and epidemic typhus (R. prowazekii). Twentieth-century public health interventions led to dramatic decreases in incidence; little is known about the contemporary TGR prevalence because neither disease is nationally notifiable. We summarized administrative claims data in a commercially insured population to examine trends in TGR medical encounters. We analysed data from 2003 to 2016 IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Databases to identify persons with inpatient or outpatient visits with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification TGR-specific code. We summarized epidemiologic characteristics associated with incident diagnosis. We identified 1,799 patients diagnosed with a TGR. Patients resided in 46 states, and most were female (n = 1,019/1,799; 56.6%); the median age was 42 years (range: 0-64 years). Epidemic typhus (n = 931/1,799; 51.8%) was the most common TGRs, followed by murine typhus (n = 722/1,799; 40.1%). The majority of TGR patients were diagnosed in an outpatient setting (n = 1,725/1,799; 95.9%); among hospitalized patients, the majority received a murine typhus diagnosis (n = 67/74; 90.5%). TGRs are rarely diagnosed diseases. More patients were diagnosed with epidemic than murine typhus, even though R. prowazekii transmission requires body louse or flying squirrel exposure. Patients from all geographic regions were diagnosed with murine and epidemic typhus, despite historically recognized ranges for these diseases. The epidemiologic misalignment of insurance claims data versus historic TGRs data highlights the challenges of finding appropriate alternative data sources to serve as a proxy when national surveillance data do not exist.

"Phylogenetic sister clades Bartonella and Brucella within the order Rhizobiales present some common biological characteristics as well as evident differences in adaptations to their mammalian reservoirs. We reviewed published data on Bartonella and Brucella infections in wild carnivores to compare the ecology of these bacteria in relatively similar host environments. Arthropod vectors are the main mechanism for Bartonella species transmission between mammalian hosts. The role of arthropods in transmission of Brucella remains disputed, however experimental studies and reported detection of Brucella in arthropods indicate potential vector transmission. More commonly, transmission of Brucella occurs via contact exposure to infected animals or the environment contaminated with their discharges. Of 26 species of carnivores tested for both Bartonella and Brucella, 58% harbored either. Among them were bobcats, African lions, golden jackals, coyotes, wolves, foxes, striped skunks, sea otters, raccoons, and harbor seals. The most common species of Bartonella in wild carnivores was B. henselae, found in 23 species, followed by B. rochalimae in 12, B. clarridgeiae in ten, and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii in seven. Among Brucella species, Br. abortus was reported in over 30 terrestrial carnivore species, followed by Br. canis in seven. Marine carnivores, such as seals and sea lions, can host Br. pinnipedialis. In contrast, there is no evidence of a Bartonella strain specific for marine mammals. Bartonella species are present practically in every sampled species of wild felids, but of 14 Brucella studies of felids, only five reported Brucella and those were limited to detection of antibodies. We found no reports of Bartonella in bears while Brucella was detected in these animals. There is evident host-specificity of Bartonella species in wild carnivores (e.g., B. henselae in felids and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii in canids). A co-adaptation of Brucella with terrestrial wild carnivore hosts is not as straightforward as in domestic animals. Wild carnivores often carry the same pathogens as their domesticated relatives (cats and dogs), but the risk of exposure varies widely because of differences in biology, distribution, and historical interactions.

"BACKGROUND: Habitat fragmentation reduces genetic connectivity for multiple species, yet conservation efforts tend to rely heavily on single-species connectivity estimates to inform land-use planning. Such conservation activities may benefit from multi-species connectivity estimates, which provide a simple and practical means to mitigate the effects of habitat fragmentation for a larger number of species. To test the validity of a multi-species connectivity model, we used neutral microsatellite genetic datasets of Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), American marten (Martes americana), fisher (Pekania pennanti), and southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) to evaluate multi-species genetic connectivity across Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: We used linear models to compare node-based estimates of genetic connectivity for each species to point-based estimates of landscape connectivity (current density) derived from circuit theory. To our knowledge, we are the first to evaluate current density as a measure of genetic connectivity. Our results depended on landscape context: habitat amount was more important than current density in explaining multi-species genetic connectivity in the northern part of our study area, where habitat was abundant and fragmentation was low. In the south however, where fragmentation was prevalent, genetic connectivity was correlated with current density. Contrary to our expectations however, locations with a high probability of movement as reflected by high current density were negatively associated with gene flow. Subsequent analyses of circuit theory outputs showed that high current density was also associated with high effective resistance, underscoring that the presence of pinch points is not necessarily indicative of gene flow. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study appears to provide support for the hypothesis that landscape pattern is important when habitat amount is low. We also conclude that while current density is proportional to the probability of movement per unit area, this does not imply increased gene flow, since high current density tends to be a result of neighbouring pixels with high cost of movement (e.g., low habitat amount). In other words, pinch points with high current density appear to constrict gene flow.

"Historically, rodents-ectoparasites are responsible for many diseases in human and domestic animal communities because they are well-adapted to the environment and nutritional resources. In addition, ectoparasites can affect the reproductive rates, ecological fitness and the dispersal pattern of their hosts. Data was compiled through all publications relating to ectoparasites fauna from Iranian rodents. Host specificity, rodent-parasites interaction, geographical distribution, ecological trends as well as the medical or veterinary importance of ectoparasites are considered in this review. Also, results compared with other equal global findings. According to the obtained information, the genus Hyalomma considered being the major vector of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Sistan-Balouchistan, Isfahan, Fars and Khuzestan are endemic provinces of this disease in Iran. Ixodes ticks (especially Hyalomma spp.) commonly existed throughout the months but had high activity in spring and late autumn seasons. Muridae as the most diversified rodent family was more reiterated exploited host by all parasites in this knowledge. Tatera indica confirmed as a positive host for Francisella tularensis by serological test but the definitive reservoir is still unclear in Iran. Meriones persicus as a nocturnal jird has been permanently presented in semi-desert areas except Dasht-e Kavir desert. This rodent was the frequent host for Pulicid fleas followed by Mus musculus and Cricetulus migratorius (Cricetidae). Rattus norvegicus was specialized host for Polyplax spinulosa (spiny rat louse). Pulex irritans from Pulicidae was spread in particularly west of Iran which known as an endemic focus of plague. Mites were high diversity than other taxa. The domestic vertebrates (sheep, goat and cattle) were primitive hosts and rodents were discovered as auxiliary hosts for ticks in Iran apparently. The available data suggested that lice had a type of model of host specificity due to their morphological traits. Meanwhile, Alborz and Zagros mountains ranges provided the specialized habitats for animals which have been surrounded by northern and western regions. Perhaps these mountainous areas can prevent gene flow between local mammalian populations. Notably, the genealogy of parasite genome can orient toward the evolutionary process into speciation point. In general, more researches are needed to decipher the whole sights of host-parasite association and the role of ectoparasites within zoonosis diseases.

"Intraspecific social behavior can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. While much research has focused on how characteristics of individuals influence their roles in social networks, we were interested in the role that landscape structure plays in animal sociality at both individual (local) and population (global) levels. We used female white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Illinois, USA, to investigate the potential effect of landscape on social network structure by weighting the edges of seasonal social networks with association rate (based on proximity inferred from GPS collar data). At the local level, we found that sociality among female deer in neighboring social groups (n = 36) was mainly explained by their home range overlap, with two exceptions: 1) during fawning in an area of mixed forest and grassland, deer whose home ranges had low forest connectivity were more social than expected; and 2) during the rut in an area of intensive agriculture, deer inhabiting home ranges with high amount and connectedness of agriculture were more social than expected. At the global scale, we found that deer populations (n = 7) in areas with highly connected forest-agriculture edge, a high proportion of agriculture, and a low proportion of forest tended to have higher weighted network closeness, although low sample size precluded statistical significance. This result implies that infectious disease could spread faster in deer populations inhabiting such landscapes. Our work advances the general understanding of animal social networks, demonstrating how landscape features can underlie differences in social behavior both within and among wildlife social networks.

"A 5-y-old, intact, 2.5-kg female domestic rabbit was presented because of blood spatter on the wall of its cage and the toenails of its right hind limb. Physical examination revealed a red, gelatinous mass that spanned the width of the right vertical ear canal. Radiographic images revealed a soft-tissue opacity at the base of the right ear, which was superimposed over the tympanic bulla and extended to the pinna. A CT scan revealed that the soft-tissue mass was within the vertical and horizontal portions of the right external ear canal and extended to the level of the tympanic membrane, with no bony involvement. An incisional biopsy of the mass and subsequent histopathology revealed heterophilic inflammation with bacteria, necrosis, and no evidence of neoplasia. The patient died during anesthesia for removal of the mass at 1 mo after the initial presentation. Necropsy with histopathology of the mass was consistent with Shope fibroma virus in light of the presence of typical intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions. Electron microscopy of paraffin-embedded tissue revealed electron-dense intracytoplasmic structures within neoplastic cells consistent with the diagnosis of Leporipoxvirus. To our knowledge, this report is the first description of Shope fibroma virus invading the external ear canal of a domestic rabbit. Given the results of this case, Shope fibroma should be considered in rabbits presenting with abnormal tissue in the ear canal.

"Within many species, males are often more heavily parasitised than females. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including immunocompetence handicaps, sexual size dimorphism and behavioural differences. Here we set out to test the latter two hypotheses and make inferences about the former by assessing patterns of ectoparasitism across various life-history stages in a population of North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). We also conducted an ectoparasite removal experiment to investigate the effects of ectoparasites on male body condition. We found that males were more intensely parasitized than females, but only during the mating period. There was no difference in ectoparasite intensity between male and female juveniles at birth or at emergence, suggesting that ectoparasites do not exploit male red squirrels for longer-range natal dispersal. Male red squirrels in our population were slightly heavier than females, however we did not find any evidence that this dimorphism drives male-biased ectoparasitism. Finally, we could not detect an effect of ectoparasite removal on male body mass. Our results lend support to the hypothesis that ectoparasites exploit their male hosts for transmission and that male red squirrels are important for the transmission dynamics of ectoparasites in this population; however, the mechanisms (i.e., immunocompetence, testosterone) are not known.

"In July 2013, a resident of the Bitterroot Valley in western Montana, USA, contracted tickborne relapsing fever caused by an infection with the spirochete Borrelia hermsii. The patient's travel history and activities before onset of illness indicated a possible exposure on his residential property on the eastern side of the valley. An onsite investigation of the potential exposure site found the vector, Ornithodoros hermsi ticks, and 1 chipmunk infected with spirochetes, which on the basis of multilocus sequence typing were identical to the spirochete isolated from the patient. Field studies in other locations found additional serologic evidence and an infected tick that demonstrated a wider distribution of spirochetes circulating among the small mammal populations. Our study demonstrates that this area of Montana represents a previously unrecognized focus of relapsing fever and poses a risk for persons of acquiring this tickborne disease.

"Currently, in developed countries, nights are excessively illuminated (light at night), whereas daytime is mainly spent indoors, and thus people are exposed to much lower light intensities than under natural conditions. In spite of the positive impact of artificial light, we pay a price for the easy access to light during the night: disorganization of our circadian system or chronodisruption (CD), including perturbations in melatonin rhythm. Epidemiological studies show that CD is associated with an increased incidence of diabetes, obesity, heart disease, cognitive and affective impairment, premature aging and some types of cancer. Knowledge of retinal photoreceptors and the discovery of melanopsin in some ganglion cells demonstrate that light intensity, timing and spectrum must be considered to keep the biological clock properly entrained. Importantly, not all wavelengths of light are equally chronodisrupting. Blue light, which is particularly beneficial during the daytime, seems to be more disruptive at night, and induces the strongest melatonin inhibition. Nocturnal blue light exposure is currently increasing, due to the proliferation of energy-efficient lighting (LEDs) and electronic devices. Thus, the development of lighting systems that preserve the melatonin rhythm could reduce the health risks induced by chronodisruption. This review addresses the state of the art regarding the crosstalk between light and the circadian system.

"Zoonosis is an infectious disease and a potential bioterrorism agent. Bioterrorism aimed at a society, government, and/or its citizens is meant to cause destabilization, fear, anxiety, illness, and death in people, animals, or plants using biological agents. A bioterrorism attack is the intentional release of biological agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, rickettsial or chlamydial organisms, toxins, or other harmful agents. This chapter focuses on the induction, monitoring, and prevention of some zoonotic diseases that have potential as bioterrorism agents. The etiology, clinical manifestations, transmission routes, and treatment of these zoonotic agents are briefly discussed.

"Seasonal variations in immunity are common in nature, and changes in day length are sufficient to trigger enhancement and suppression of immune function in many vertebrates. Drawing primarily on data from Siberian hamsters, this review describes formal and physiological aspects of the neuroendocrine regulation of seasonal changes in mammalian immunity. Photoperiod regulates immunity in a trait-specific manner, and seasonal changes in gonadal hormone secretion and thyroid hormone signaling all participate in seasonal immunomodulation. Photoperiod-driven changes in the hamster reproductive and immune systems are associated with changes in iodothyronine deiodinase-mediated thyroid hormone signaling, but photoperiod exerts opposite effects on select aspects of the epigenetic regulation of reproductive neuroendocrine and lymphoid tissues. Photoperiodic changes in immunocompetence may explain a proportion of the annual variance in disease incidence and severity in nature, and provide a useful framework to help understand brain-immune interactions.

"The effect of biodiversity declines on human health is currently debated, but empirical assessments are lacking. Lyme disease provides a model system to assess relationships between biodiversity and human disease because the etiologic agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted in the United States by the generalist black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) among a wide range of mammalian and avian hosts. The 'dilution effect' hypothesis predicts that species-poor host communities dominated by white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) will pose the greatest human risk because P. leucopus infects the largest numbers of ticks, resulting in higher human exposure to infected I. scapularis ticks. P. leucopus-dominated communities are also expected to maintain a higher frequency of those B. burgdorferi outer surface protein C (ospC) genotypes that this host species more efficiently transmits ('multiple niche polymorphism' hypothesis). Because some of these genotypes are human invasive, an additive increase in human disease risk is expected in species-poor settings. We assessed these theoretical predictions by comparing I. scapularis nymphal infection prevalence, density of infected nymphs and B. burgdorferi genotype diversity at sites on Block Island, RI, where P. leucopus dominates the mammalian host community, to species-diverse sites in northeastern Connecticut. We found no support for the dilution effect hypothesis; B. burgdorferi nymphal infection prevalence was similar between island and mainland and the density of B. burgdorferi infected nymphs was higher on the mainland, contrary to what is predicted by the dilution effect hypothesis. Evidence for the multiple niche polymorphism hypothesis was mixed: there was lower ospC genotype diversity at island than mainland sites, but no overrepresentation of genotypes with higher fitness in P. leucopus or that are more invasive in humans. We conclude that other mechanisms explain similar nymphal infection prevalence in both communities and that high ospC genotype diversity can be maintained in both species-poor and species-rich communities.

"Introduced hosts populations may benefit of an ""enemy release"" through impoverishment of parasite communities made of both few imported species and few acquired local ones. Moreover, closely related competing native hosts can be affected by acquiring introduced taxa (spillover) and by increased transmission risk of native parasites (spillback). We determined the macroparasite fauna of invasive grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in Italy to detect any diversity loss, introduction of novel parasites or acquisition of local ones, and analysed variation in parasite burdens to identify factors that may increase transmission risk for native red squirrels (S. vulgaris). Based on 277 grey squirrels sampled from 7 populations characterised by different time scales in introduction events, we identified 7 gastro-intestinal helminths and 4 parasite arthropods. Parasite richness is lower than in grey squirrel's native range and independent from introduction time lags. The most common parasites are Nearctic nematodes Strongyloides robustus (prevalence: 56.6%) and Trichostrongylus calcaratus (6.5%), red squirrel flea Ceratophyllus sciurorum (26.0%) and Holarctic sucking louse Neohaematopinus sciuri (17.7%). All other parasites are European or cosmopolitan species with prevalence below 5%. S. robustus abundance is positively affected by host density and body mass, C. sciurorum abundance increases with host density and varies with seasons. Overall, we show that grey squirrels in Italy may benefit of an enemy release, and both spillback and spillover processes towards native red squirrels may occur.

"Notoedric mange, caused by the contagious, burrowing mite Notoedres centrifera, has been associated with several large-scale population declines of western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus) and has been a significant obstacle to population recovery in Washington State where the species is listed as threatened. In 2009, residents and wildlife rehabilitators in the isolated San Bernardino Mountains of southern California reported a dramatic die-off of western gray squirrels, in what had been a previously dense and robust population. Individuals were observed suffering from abnormal neurologic behaviors (ataxia and obtundation) and severe skin disease. Full necropsy of five squirrels from the epidemic showed that all had moderate to severe infestation with mange mites and severe dermatitis characterized by hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, intralesional mites, intracorneal pustules and superficial bacteria. Mites from affected squirrels were evaluated by light and electron microscopy and identified as N. centrifera based on morphologic criteria. Additionally, the internal transcribed spacer-2 region of the mite was cloned, sequenced and accessioned in GenBank. The cause for the abnormal neurologic behavior was not confirmed on post-mortem examination. However, we hypothesize that mange can cause incoordination and obtundation as a result of malnutrition and dehydration, and intense pruritis may induce abnormal or erratic behavior that could be mistaken for neurologic signs. While we have characterized the severe impact this disease can have on individual animals, more work is needed to understand the impact on squirrel populations, particularly in view of the anecdotal reports of dramatic population declines that may take decades to recover.

"Social animals are susceptible to high infection levels by contact-transmitted parasites due to increased conspecific interaction. Exotic parasites are known to have adverse consequences on native hosts. We examined the relationship between social group size and exotic ectoparasite loads, and adult infection levels with per capita fitness and offspring survival in the plural breeding rodent Octodon degus in central Chile. Degus at our site were almost entirely infected by two exotic ectoparasites: the fleas Leptopsylla segnis and Xenopsylla cheopis. Neither group size nor number of females per group predicted the abundance of either exotic flea species. The per capita number of pups (per capita fitness) that emerged from burrow systems used by known social groups was negatively correlated with abundance of L. segnis but not X. cheopis. On adults, X. cheopis abundance was three times greater than L. segnis but was not significantly correlated with per capita fitness. In females, L. segnis abundance was negatively correlated with peak body mass during pregnancy. Adult ectoparasite load was not correlated with offspring survival. Based on these results, we hypothesize that high infection levels of L. segnis result in decreased reproductive fitness of adult female degus but are not a cost of sociality because parasite loads are not predicted by social group size. Further work is needed to experimentally test this hypothesis and to determine if L. segnis serves as a vector for a deleterious pathogen. Lastly, the lack of native ectoparasites may explain why a previous study at our site determined that behavioral adaptations needed to cope with high ectoparasite burdens (e.g., grooming) are not extensive in degus; they simply have not had the coevolutionary time needed for selection of these behaviors.

"The vascular endothelium is the main target of a limited number of infectious agents, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia ruminantium, and Orientia tsutsugamushi are among them. These arthropod-transmitted obligately-intracellular bacteria cause serious systemic diseases that are not infrequently lethal. In this review, we discuss the bacterial biology, vector biology, and clinical aspects of these conditions with particular emphasis on the interactions of these bacteria with the vascular endothelium and how it responds to intracellular infection. The study of these bacteria in relevant in vivo models is likely to offer new insights into the physiology of the endothelium that have not been revealed by other models.

"Bartonella species are fastidious, gram negative bacteria, some of which are transmitted by arthropod vectors, including fleas, sandflies, and lice. There is very little information regarding the interaction and/or transmission capabilities of Bartonella species by ticks. In the present study, we demonstrate successful infection of the Amblyomma americanum cell line, AAE12, by seven Bartonella isolates and three Candidatus Bartonella species by electron or light microscopy. With the exception of Bartonella bovis, infection with all other examined Bartonella species induced cytopathic effects characterized by heavy cellular vacuolization and eventually cell lysis. Furthermore, using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR), we demonstrated significant amplification of two B. henselae genotype I isolates in the A. americanum cell line over a 5 days period. Ultimately, tick-cell derived Bartonella antigens may prove useful for the development of more sensitive diagnostic reagents and may assist in the development of an effective vaccine to prevent the further spread of disease caused by these organisms.

"Individuals of free-living organisms are often infected simultaneously by a community of parasites. If the co-infecting parasites interact, then this can add significantly to the diversity of host genotypexparasite genotype interactions. However, interactions between parasite species are usually not examined considering potential variation in interactions between different strain combinations of co-infecting parasites. Here, we examined the importance of interactions between strains of fish eye flukes Diplostomum spathaceum and Diplostomum gasterostei on their infectivity in naive fish hosts. We assessed the infection success of strains of both species in single-strain exposures and in co-exposures with a random strain of the other species. Parasite infection success did not consistently increase or decrease in the co-exposure treatment, but depended on the combinations of co-infecting parasite strains. This disrupted the relative infectivity of D. spathaceum strains observed in single-strain exposures. The infection success of D. gasterostei strains was independent of exposure type. These results suggest that interactions among parasite species may be strain specific and potentially promote maintenance of genetic polymorphism in parasite populations.

"Twenty Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks collected in eastern Arizona were tested by PCR assay to establish their infection rate with spotted fever group rickettsiae. With a nested PCR assay which detects a fragment of the Rickettsia genus-specific 17-kDa antigen gene (htrA), five ticks (25%) were found to contain rickettsial DNA. One rickettsial isolate was obtained from these ticks by inoculating a suspension of a triturated tick into monolayers of Vero E6 monkey kidney cells and XTC-2 clawed toad cells, and its cell culture and genotypic characteristics were determined. Fragments of the 16S rRNA, GltA, rOmpA, rOmpB, and Sca4 genes had 100%, 100%, 99%, 99%, and 99%, respectively, nucleotide similarity to Rickettsia massiliae strain Bar29, previously isolated from R. sanguineus in Catalonia, Spain (L. Beati et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:2688-2694, 1996). The new isolate, AZT80, does not elicit cytotoxic effects in Vero cells and causes a persistent infection in XTC-2 cells. The AZT80 strain is susceptible to doxycycline but resistant to rifampin and erythromycin. Whether R. massiliae AZT80 is pathogenic or infectious for dogs and humans or can cause seroconversion to spotted fever group antigens in the United States is unknown.

"In March 2002, typhus fever was diagnosed in two patients residing in West Virginia and Georgia. Both patients were hospitalized with severe febrile illnesses, and both had been recently exposed to or had physical contact with flying squirrels or flying squirrel nests. Laboratory results indicated Rickettsia prowazekii infection.

"Rickettsioses are caused by species of Rickettsia, a genus comprising organisms characterized by their strictly intracellular location and their association with arthropods. Rickettsia species are difficult to cultivate in vitro and exhibit strong serological cross-reactions with each other. These technical difficulties long prohibited a detailed study of the rickettsiae, and it is only following the recent introduction of novel laboratory methods that progress in this field has been possible. In this review, we discuss the impact that these practical innovations have had on the study of rickettsiae. Prior to 1986, only eight rickettsioses were clinically recognized; however, in the last 10 years, an additional six have been discovered. We describe the different steps that resulted in the description of each new rickettsiosis and discuss the influence of factors as diverse as physicians' curiosity and the adoption of molecular biology-based identification in helping to recognize these new infections. We also assess the pathogenic potential of rickettsial strains that to date have been associated only with arthropods, and we discuss diseases of unknown etiology that may be rickettsioses.

"The 120-kDa surface protein antigens (SPAs) of typhus rickettsiae are highly immunogenic and have been shown to be responsible for the species-specific serological reactions of the typhus group rickettsiae. To study the immunochemistry of these proteins, overlapping decapeptides encompassing the whole protein were synthesized on derivatized polyethylene pins. A modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to identify epitopes recognized by rabbit hyperimmune antisera to Rickettsia prowazekii SPA. Eight distinct epitopes were mapped by this method in three regions. Four of the epitopes, which were located in the carboxyterminus of mature processed SPA, were strongly competitively inhibited by native folded SPA but not by intact rickettsiae, suggesting that they were on the SPA surface but not exposed on the rickettsial surface. Three of these epitopes were present on both R. prowazekii and Rickettsia typhi SPAs. The immunoreactivities of five epitopes were further characterized by synthesizing modified peptides. Glycine substitution experiments determined the critical residues in the epitopes. The dependence of binding of the peptide epitopes to the polyclonal antisera was mapped to single residues. The limited number and weak reactivity of linear peptide epitopes observed with human and rabbit sera, possibly due to a lack of the methylated amino acids which are present in rickettsia-derived SPA, suggest that the present approach will not provide useful synthetic antigens for diagnosis of typhus infections.
"
"The DNA from flying squirrel-associated Rickettsia prowazekii was characterized by using a specific DNA fragment produced by digestion with the enzyme BamHI. The DNA fragment was cloned into a plasmid vector and used to readily distinguish between available human- and flying squirrel-associated R. prowazekii DNAs derived from crude cytoplasmic extracts.
"
"Four strains of Rickettsia prowazekii, isolated from flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans volans) from Florida and Virginia, were compared with other strains of the typhus biotype, two previously established strains each of R. prowazekii and R. typhi and one strain of R. canada, for similarities in a number of unrelated phenotypic characteristics. R. akari served as a spotted fever biotype control. All strains produced small plaques on chicken embryo cell monolayers that were clearly recognized only after 10 days of incubation at 32 degrees C. All strains were highly susceptible to erythromycin. The Renografin density gradient centrifugation procedure of separating rickettsiae from the infected yolk sacs of surviving chicken embryos was equally satisfactory in all cases and resulted in moderate to large yields of purified rickettsiae. There was relatively small variation in specific hemolytic activity or specific CO(2) formation from glutamate. None of the strains catabolized glucose. There was some strain variation in virulence for the chicken embryo, but none of the above tests separated the three species of the typhus biotype. On the other hand, R. akari was clearly distinguished by its more rapid plaque formation and by higher resistance to erythromycin. It is concluded that by the tests conducted thus far, the biological properties of the flying squirrel strains do not differ substantially from those of other strains of the typhus biotype.

"Intravitreal injection is the most widely used injection technique for ocular gene delivery. However, vector diffusion is attenuated by physical barriers and neutralizing antibodies in the vitreous. The 13-lined ground squirrel (13-LGS), as in humans, has a larger relative vitreous body volume than the more common rodent models such as rats and mice, which would further reduce transduction efficiency with the intravitreal injection route. We report here a ""pre-retinal"" injection approach that leads to detachment of the posterior hyaloid membrane and delivers vector into the space between vitreous and inner retina. Vectors carrying a ubiquitously expressing mCherry reporter were injected into the deep vitreous or pre-retinal space in adult wild-type 13-LGSs. Then, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated mCherry expression was evaluated with non-invasive imaging, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Compared to deep vitreous delivery, pre-retinal administration achieved pan-retinal gene expression with a lower vector dose volume and significantly increased the number of transduced cone photoreceptors. These results suggest that pre-retinal injection is a promising tool in the development of gene therapy strategies in animal models and is a potential approach for use in human research, particularly in younger individuals with an intact posterior hyaloid membrane and stable vitreous.

"Diabetes mellitus is a major debilitating disease whose global incidence is progressively increasing with currently over 463 million adult sufferers and this figure will likely reach over 700 million by the year 2045. It is the complications of diabetes such as cardiovascular, renal, neuronal and ocular dysfunction that lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality. Of these, cardiovascular complications that can result in stroke and cardiomyopathies are 2- to 5-fold more likely in diabetes but the underlying mechanisms involved in their development are not fully understood. Emerging research suggests that members of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR/ErbB/HER) family of tyrosine kinases can have a dual role in that they are beneficially required for normal development and physiological functioning of the cardiovascular system (CVS) as well as in salvage pathways following acute cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury but their chronic dysregulation may also be intricately involved in mediating diabetes-induced cardiovascular pathologies. Here we review the evidence for EGFR/ErbB/HER receptors in mediating these dual roles in the CVS and also discuss their potential interplay with the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System heptapeptide, Angiotensin-(1-7), as well the arachidonic acid metabolite, 20-HETE (20-hydroxy-5, 8, 11, 14-eicosatetraenoic acid). A greater understanding of the multi-faceted roles of EGFR/ErbB/HER family of tyrosine kinases and their interplay with other key modulators of cardiovascular function could facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating diabetes-induced cardiovascular complications.

"Eukaryotic cells can expand their coding ability by using their splicing machinery, spliceosome, to process precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) into mature messenger RNA. The mega-macromolecular spliceosome contains multiple subcomplexes, referred to as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Among these, U1 snRNP and its central component, U1-70K, are crucial for splice site recognition during early spliceosome assembly. The human U1-70K has been linked to several types of human autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. However, its phylogenetic relationship has been seldom reported. To this end, we carried out a systemic analysis of 95 animal U1-70K genes and compare these proteins to their yeast and plant counterparts. Analysis of their gene and protein structures, expression patterns and splicing conservation suggest that animal U1-70Ks are conserved in their molecular function, and may play essential role in cancers and juvenile development. In particular, animal U1-70Ks display unique characteristics of single copy number and a splicing isoform with truncated C-terminal, suggesting the specific role of these U1-70Ks in animal kingdom. In summary, our results provide phylogenetic overview of U1-70K gene family in vertebrates. In silico analyses conducted in this work will act as a reference for future functional studies of this crucial U1 splicing factor in animal kingdom.

"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) hinders the distribution of therapeutics intended for treatment of diseases of the brain. Our previous studies demonstrated that that a soluble form of melanotransferrin (MTf; Uniprot P08582; also known as p97, MFI2, and CD228), a mammalian iron-transport protein, is an effective carrier for delivery of drug conjugates across the BBB into the brain and was the first BBB targeting delivery system to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy within the brain. Here, we performed a screen to identify peptides from MTf capable of traversing the BBB. We identified a highly conserved 12-amino acid peptide, termed MTfp, that retains the ability to cross the intact BBB intact, distributes throughout the parenchyma, and enter endosomes and lysosomes within neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the brain. This peptide may provide a platform for the transport of therapeutics to the CNS, and thereby offers new avenues for potential treatments of neuropathologies that are currently refractory to existing therapies.

"The mammalian brain is highly vulnerable to oxygen deprivation, yet the mechanism underlying the brain's sensitivity to hypoxia is incompletely understood. Hypoxia induces accumulation of hydrogen sulfide, a gas that inhibits mitochondrial respiration. Here, we show that, in mice, rats, and naturally hypoxia-tolerant ground squirrels, the sensitivity of the brain to hypoxia is inversely related to the levels of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) and the capacity to catabolize sulfide. Silencing SQOR increased the sensitivity of the brain to hypoxia, whereas neuron-specific SQOR expression prevented hypoxia-induced sulfide accumulation, bioenergetic failure, and ischemic brain injury. Excluding SQOR from mitochondria increased sensitivity to hypoxia not only in the brain but also in heart and liver. Pharmacological scavenging of sulfide maintained mitochondrial respiration in hypoxic neurons and made mice resistant to hypoxia. These results illuminate the critical role of sulfide catabolism in energy homeostasis during hypoxia and identify a therapeutic target for ischemic brain injury.

"Hibernators dramatically lower metabolism to save energy while fasting for months. Prolonged fasting challenges metabolic homeostasis, yet small-bodied hibernators emerge each spring ready to resume all aspects of active life, including immediate reproduction. The liver is the body's metabolic hub, processing and detoxifying macromolecules to provide essential fuels to brain, muscle and other organs throughout the body. Here we quantify changes in liver gene expression across several distinct physiological states of hibernation in 13-lined ground squirrels, using RNA-seq to measure the steady-state transcriptome and GRO-seq to measure transcription for the first time in a hibernator. Our data capture key timepoints in both the seasonal and torpor-arousal cycles of hibernation. Strong positive correlation between transcription and the transcriptome indicates that transcriptional control dominates the known seasonal reprogramming of metabolic gene expression in liver for hibernation. During the torpor-arousal cycle, however, discordance develops between transcription and the steady-state transcriptome by at least two mechanisms: 1) although not transcribed during torpor, some transcripts are unusually stable across the torpor bout; and 2) unexpectedly, on some genes, our data suggest continuing, slow elongation with a failure to terminate transcription across the torpor bout. While the steady-state RNAs corresponding to these read through transcripts did not increase during torpor, they did increase shortly after rewarming despite their simultaneously low transcription. Both of these mechanisms would assure the immediate availability of functional transcripts upon rewarming. Integration of transcriptional, post-transcriptional and RNA stability control mechanisms, all demonstrated in these data, likely initiate a serial gene expression program across the short euthermic period that restores the tissue and prepares the animal for the next bout of torpor.

"Tissue-resident stem cells may enter a dormant state, also known as quiescence, which allows them to withstand metabolic stress and unfavorable conditions. Similarly, hibernating mammals can also enter a state of dormancy used to evade hostile circumstances, such as food shortage and low ambient temperatures. In hibernation, the dormant state of the individual and its cells is commonly known as torpor, and is characterized by metabolic suppression in individual cells. Given that both conditions represent cell survival strategies, we here compare the molecular aspects of cellular quiescence, particularly of well-studied hematopoietic stem cells, and torpor at the cellular level. Critical processes of dormancy are reviewed, including the suppression of the cell cycle, changes in metabolic characteristics, and cellular mechanisms of dealing with damage. Key factors shared by hematopoietic stem cell quiescence and torpor include a reversible activation of factors inhibiting the cell cycle, a shift in metabolism from glucose to fatty acid oxidation, downregulation of mitochondrial activity, key changes in hypoxia-inducible factor one alpha (HIF-1α), mTOR, reversible protein phosphorylation and autophagy, and increased radiation resistance. This similarity is remarkable in view of the difference in cell populations, as stem cell quiescence regards proliferating cells, while torpor mainly involves terminally differentiated cells. A future perspective is provided how to advance our understanding of the crucial pathways that allow stem cells and hibernating animals to engage in their 'great slumbers.'

"COVID-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has quickly become a global health crisis since the first report of infection in December of 2019. However, the infection spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 and its comprehensive protein-level interactions with hosts remain unclear. There is a massive amount of underutilized data and knowledge about RNA viruses highly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 and proteins of their hosts. More in-depth and more comprehensive analyses of that knowledge and data can shed new light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 pandemic and reveal potential risks. In this work, we constructed a multi-layer virus-host interaction network to incorporate these data and knowledge. We developed a machine-learning-based method to predict virus-host interactions at both protein and organism levels. Our approach revealed five potential infection targets of SARS-CoV-2 and 19 highly possible interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human proteins in the innate immune pathway.

"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide problem for the human population. It is known that some animal species, such as mink, can become infected and transmit the virus. However, the susceptibility of most animals is not known. Here, we review the use of sequence analysis of the proteins which are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 as a way to estimate an animal's susceptibility. Although most such work concentrates on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), here TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2), neuropilin-1 and furin are also considered. Polymorphisms, especially ones which are known to alter viral/host interactions are also discussed. Analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein sequences across species suggests this approach may be of some utility in predicting susceptibility; however, this analysis fails to highlight some susceptible animals such as mink. However, combined with observational data which emerges over time about which animals actually become infected, this may, in the future, be a useful tool to assist the management of risks associated with human/animal contact and support conservation and animal welfare measures.

"The role of the hypothalamic preoptic area (POA) in arousal state regulation has been studied since Constantin von Economo first recognized its importance in the early twentieth century. Over the intervening decades, the POA has been shown to modulate arousal in both natural (sleep and wake) as well as drug-induced (anesthetic-induced unconsciousness) states. While the POA is well known for its role in sleep promotion, populations of wake-promoting neurons within the region have also been identified. However, the complexity and molecular heterogeneity of the POA has made distinguishing these two populations difficult. Though multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that general anesthetics modulate the activity of the POA, the region's heterogeneity has also made it challenging to determine whether the same neurons involved in sleep/wake regulation also modulate arousal in response to general anesthetics. While a number of studies show that sleep-promoting POA neurons are activated by various anesthetics, recent work suggests this is not universal to all arousal-regulating POA neurons. Technical innovations are making it increasingly possible to classify and distinguish the molecular identities of neurons involved in sleep/wake regulation as well as anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. Here, we review the current understanding of the POA's role in arousal state regulation of both natural and drug-induced forms of unconsciousness, including its molecular organization and connectivity to other known sleep and wake promoting regions. Further insights into the molecular identities and connectivity of arousal-regulating POA neurons will be critical in fully understanding how this complex region regulates arousal states.

"Retrobulbar fat deposits surround the posterior retina and optic nerve head, but their function and origin are obscure. We report that mouse retrobulbar fat is a neural crest-derived tissue histologically and transcriptionally resembles interscapular brown fat. In contrast, human retrobulbar fat closely resembles white adipose tissue. Retrobulbar fat is also brown in other rodents, which are typically housed at temperatures below thermoneutrality, but is white in larger animals. We show that retrobulbar fat in mice housed at thermoneutral temperature show reduced expression of the brown fat marker Ucp1, and histological properties intermediate between white and brown fat. We conclude that retrobulbar fat can potentially serve as a site of active thermogenesis, that this capability is both temperature and species-dependent, and that this may facilitate regulation of intraocular temperature.

"Innate fear intimately connects to the life preservation in crises, although this relationships is not fully understood. Here, we report that presentation of a supernormal innate fear inducer 2-methyl-2-thiazoline (2MT), but not learned fear stimuli, induced robust systemic hypothermia/hypometabolism and suppressed aerobic metabolism via phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby enabling long-term survival in a lethal hypoxic environment. These responses exerted potent therapeutic effects in cutaneous and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury models. In contrast to hibernation, 2MT stimulation accelerated glucose uptake in the brain and suppressed oxygen saturation in the blood. Whole-brain mapping and chemogenetic activation revealed that the sensory representation of 2MT orchestrates physiological responses via brain stem Sp5/NST to midbrain PBN pathway. 2MT, as a supernormal stimulus of innate fear, induced exaggerated, latent life-protective effects in mice. If this system is preserved in humans, it may be utilized to give rise to a new field: ""sensory medicine.""

"With new and advanced technology, human exploration has reached outside of the Earth's boundaries. There are plans for reaching Mars and the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, and even to build a permanent base on the Moon. However, human beings have evolved on Earth with levels of gravity and radiation that are very different from those that we have to face in space. These issues seem to pose a significant limitation on exploration. Although there are plausible solutions for problems related to the lack of gravity, it is still unclear how to address the radiation problem. Several solutions have been proposed, such as passive or active shielding or the use of specific drugs that could reduce the effects of radiation. Recently, a method that reproduces a mechanism similar to hibernation or torpor, known as synthetic torpor, has started to become possible. Several studies show that hibernators are resistant to acute high-dose-rate radiation exposure. However, the underlying mechanism of how this occurs remains unclear, and further investigation is needed. Whether synthetic hibernation will also protect from the deleterious effects of chronic low-dose-rate radiation exposure is currently unknown. Hibernators can modulate their neuronal firing, adjust their cardiovascular function, regulate their body temperature, preserve their muscles during prolonged inactivity, regulate their immune system, and most importantly, increase their radioresistance during the inactive period. According to recent studies, synthetic hibernation, just like natural hibernation, could mitigate radiation-induced toxicity. In this review, we see what artificial hibernation is and how it could help the next generation of astronauts in future interplanetary missions.

"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causing agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), is likely to be originated from bat and transmitted through intermediate hosts. However, the immediate source species of SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been confirmed. Here, we used diversity analysis of the angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that serves as cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which has been proved to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 for spike protein priming. We also simulated the structure of receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2S RBD) with the ACE2s to investigate their binding affinity to determine the potential intermediate animal hosts that could spread the SARS-CoV-2 to humans in South Asia. We identified cow, buffalo, goat and sheep, which are predominant species in the household farming system in South Asia that can potentially be infected by SARS-CoV-2. All the bird species studied along with rat and mouse were considered less potential to interact with SARS-CoV-2. The interaction interfaces of SARS-CoV-2S RBD and ACE2 protein complex suggests pangolin as a potential intermediate host in SARS-CoV-2. Our results provide a valuable resource for the identification of potential hosts for SARS-CoV-2 in South Asia and henceforth reduce the opportunity for a future outbreak of COVID-19.

"The potential role of wild mammals in the epidemiology of influenza A viruses (IAVs) at the farm-side level has gained increasing consideration over the past two decades. In some instances, select mammals may be more likely to visit riparian areas (both close and distant to farms) as well as poultry farms, as compared to traditional reservoir hosts, such as waterfowl. Of significance, many mammalian species can successfully replicate and shed multiple avian IAVs to high titers without prior virus adaptation and often can shed virus in greater quantities than synanthropic avian species. Within this review, we summarize and discuss the potential risks that synanthropic mammals could pose by trafficking IAVs to poultry operations based on current and historic literature.

"The Zoonomia Project is investigating the genomics of shared and specialized traits in eutherian mammals. Here we provide genome assemblies for 131 species, of which all but 9 are previously uncharacterized, and describe a whole-genome alignment of 240 species of considerable phylogenetic diversity, comprising representatives from more than 80% of mammalian families. We find that regions of reduced genetic diversity are more abundant in species at a high risk of extinction, discern signals of evolutionary selection at high resolution and provide insights from individual reference genomes. By prioritizing phylogenetic diversity and making data available quickly and without restriction, the Zoonomia Project aims to support biological discovery, medical research and the conservation of biodiversity.

"Retroviruses have infiltrated vertebrate germlines for millions of years as inherited endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Mammalian genomes host large numbers of ERVs and transposable elements (TEs), including retrotransposons and DNA transposons, that contribute to genomic innovation and evolution as coopted genes and regulators of diverse functions. To explore features distinguishing coopted ERVs and TEs from other integrations, we focus on the potential role of ZBED6 and repeated ERV domestication as repurposed Syncytin genes. The placental mammal-specific ZBED6 is a DNA transposon-derived transcription regulator and we demonstrate that its binding motifs are associated with distinct Syncytins and that ZBED6 binding motifs are 2- to 3-fold more frequent in ERVs than in flanking DNA. Our observations suggest that ZBED6 could contribute an extended regulatory role of genomic expression, utilizing ERVs as platforms for genomic innovation and evolution.

"Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is a member of orthopoxvirus genus. The reemergence of MPXV in 2017 (at Bayelsa state) after 39 years of no reported case in Nigeria, and the export of travelers' monkeypox (MPX) from Nigeria to other parts of the world, in 2018 and 2019, respectively, have raised concern that MPXV may have emerged to occupy the ecological and immunological niche vacated by smallpox virus. This review X-rays the current state of knowledge pertaining the infection biology, epidemiology, and evolution of MPXV in Nigeria and worldwide, especially with regard to the human, cellular, and viral factors that modulate the virus transmission dynamics, infection, and its maintenance in nature. This paper also elucidates the role of recombination, gene loss and gene gain in MPXV evolution, chronicles the role of signaling in MPXV infection, and reviews the current therapeutic options available for the treatment and prevention of MPX. Additionally, genome-wide phylogenetic analysis was undertaken, and we show that MPXV isolates from recent 2017 outbreak in Nigeria were monophyletic with the isolate exported to Israel from Nigeria but do not share the most recent common ancestor with isolates obtained from earlier outbreaks, in 1971 and 1978, respectively. Finally, the review highlighted gaps in knowledge particularly the non-identification of a definitive reservoir host animal for MPXV and proposed future research endeavors to address the unresolved questions.

"Despite the continued global spread of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the nonavailability of a vaccine or targeted drug against this disease is still prevailing. The most established mechanism of viral entry into the body is considered to be via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acting as a receptor for viral spike protein thereby facilitating its entry in the cell. However, ACE2 is also involved in providing the protection from severe pathological changes. This article provides a computational and bioinformatics-based analysis of ACE2 with an objective of providing further insight into the earnest efforts to determine its true position in COVID-19 pathology. The results of this study show that ACE2 has strikingly low expression in healthy human lung tissue and was absent from the list of differentially expressed genes. However, when transcription factors were analyzed, we found a significant upregulation of FOS and downregulation of FOXO4 and FOXP2. Moreover, the miRNA prediction analysis revealed that miR-1246, whose upregulation has been experimentally established to be a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), was found to be targeting the coding DNA sequence (CDS) of ACE2. This study presents a wide range of potentially important transcription factors as well as miRNA targets associated with ACE2 which can be potentially used for drug designing amid this challenging pandemic situation.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

"Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channel is a multimodal receptor that is responsible for nociceptive, thermal, and mechanical sensations. However, which biomolecular partners specifically interact with TRPV1 remains to be elucidated. Here, we used cDNA library screening of genes from mouse dorsal root ganglia combined with patch-clamp electrophysiology to identify the voltage-gated potassium channel auxiliary subunit Kvβ1 physically interacting with TRPV1 channel and regulating its function. The interaction was validated in situ using endogenous dorsal root ganglia neurons, as well as a recombinant expression model in HEK 293T cells. The presence of Kvβ1 enhanced the expression stability of TRPV1 channels on the plasma membrane and the nociceptive current density. Surprisingly, Kvβ1 interaction also shifted the temperature threshold for TRPV1 thermal activation. Using site-specific mapping, we further revealed that Kvβ1 interacted with the membrane-distal domain and membrane-proximal domain of TRPV1 to regulate its membrane expression and temperature-activation threshold, respectively. Our data therefore suggest that Kvβ1 is a key element in the TRPV1 signaling complex and exerts dual regulatory effects in a site-specific manner.

"Many organisms in nature have evolved mechanisms to tolerate severe hypoxia or ischemia, including the hibernation-capable Arctic ground squirrel (AGS). Although hypoxic or ischemia tolerance in AGS involves physiological adaptations, little is known about the critical cellular mechanisms underlying intrinsic AGS cell resilience to metabolic stress. Through cell survival-based cDNA expression screens in neural progenitor cells, we identify a genetic variant of AGS Atp5g1 that confers cell resilience to metabolic stress. Atp5g1 encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Ectopic expression in mouse cells and CRISPR/Cas9 base editing of endogenous AGS loci revealed causal roles of one AGS-specific amino acid substitution in mediating cytoprotection by AGS ATP5G1. AGS ATP5G1 promotes metabolic stress resilience by modulating mitochondrial morphological change and metabolic functions. Our results identify a naturally occurring variant of ATP5G1 from a mammalian hibernator that critically contributes to intrinsic cytoprotection against metabolic stress.

"Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.

"Mammalian genomes contain many imprinted microRNAs. When an imprinted miRNA targets an unimprinted mRNA their interaction may have different fitness consequences for the loci encoding the miRNA and mRNA. In one possible outcome, the mRNA sequence evolves to evade regulation by the miRNA by a simple change of target sequence. Such a response is unavailable if the targeted sequence is strongly constrained by other functions. In these cases, the mRNA evolves to accommodate regulation by the imprinted miRNA. These evolutionary dynamics are illustrated using the examples of the imprinted C19MC cluster of miRNAs in primates and C2MC cluster in mice that are paternally expressed in placentas. The 3' UTR of PTEN, a gene with growth-related and metabolic functions, appears to be an important target of miRNAs from both clusters.

"Galectins are a family of soluble β-galactoside-binding proteins with diverse glycan-dependent and glycan-independent functions outside and inside the cell. Human cells express twelve out of sixteen recognized mammalian galectin genes and their expression profiles are very different between cell types and tissues. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the changes in the expression of individual galectins at mRNA and protein levels in different types of differentiating cells and the effects of recombinant galectins on cellular differentiation. A new model of galectin regulation is proposed considering the change in O-GlcNAc homeostasis between progenitor/stem cells and mature differentiated cells. The recognition of galectins as regulatory factors controlling cell differentiation and self-renewal is essential for developmental and cancer biology to develop innovative strategies for prevention and targeted treatment of proliferative diseases, tissue regeneration, and stem-cell therapy.

"BACKGROUND: The gut is the major organ for nutrient absorption and immune response in the body of animals. Although effects of fasting on the gut functions have been extensively studied in model animals (e.g. mice), little is known about the response of the gut to fasting in a natural condition (e.g. hibernation). During hibernation, animals endure the long term of fasting and hypothermia. RESULTS: Here we generated the first gut transcriptome in a wild hibernating bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). We identified 1614 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during four physiological states (Torpor, Arousal, Winter Active and Summer Active). Gene co-expression network analysis assigns 926 DEGs into six modules associated with Torpor and Arousal. Our results reveal that in response to the stress of luminal nutrient deficiency during hibernation, the gut helps to reduce food intake by overexpressing genes (e.g. CCK and GPR17) that regulate the sensitivity to insulin and leptin. At the same time, the gut contributes energy supply by overexpressing genes that increase capacity for ketogenesis (HMGCS2) and selective autophagy (TEX264). Furthermore, we identified separate sets of multiple DEGs upregulated in Torpor and Arousal whose functions are involved in innate immunity. CONCLUSION: This is the first gut transcriptome of a hibernating mammal. Our study identified candidate genes associated with regulation of food intake and enhance of innate immunity in the gut during hibernation. By comparing with previous studies, we found that two DEGs (CPE and HSPA8) were also significantly elevated during torpor in liver and brain of R. ferrumequinum and several DEGs (e.g. TXNIP and PDK1/4) were commonly upregulated during torpor in multiple tissues of different mammals. Our results support that shared expression changes may underlie the hibernation phenotype by most mammals.

"BACKGROUND: Lubiprostone (LBP) is a novel chloride channel opener that has been reported to activate chloride channel protein 2 (ClC-2) and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). LBP facilitates fluid secretion by activating CFTR in the intestine and is used as a drug for treating chronic constipation. While ClC-2 and CFTR expression has been confirmed in cardiomyocytes (CMs), the effect of LBP on CMs has not yet been investigated. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of LBP on CMs using mouse-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived CMs (iPS-CMs). METHODS: We induced mouse iPS cells into CMs through embryoid body (EB) formation. We compared the differentiated cells to CMs isolated from adult and fetal mice using gene expression, spontaneous beating rate, and contraction ratio analyses. RESULTS: Gene expression analysis revealed that, in the iPS-CMs, the mRNA expression of the undifferentiated cell markers Rex1 and Nanog decreased, whereas the expression of the unique cardiomyocyte markers cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and cardiac troponin T (cTNT), increased. Immunostaining showed that the localization of cTnI and connexin-43 in the iPS-CMs was similar to that in the primary fetal CMs (FCMs) and adult CMs (ACMs). LBP decreased the spontaneous beating rate of the iPS-CMs and FCMs, and decreased the contraction ratio of the iPS-CMs and ACMs. The reduction in the beating rate and contraction ratio caused by LBP was inhibited by glycine hydrazide (GlyH), which is a CFTR inhibitor. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LBP stimulates CFTR in CMs and that LBP has negative chronotropic and inotropic effects on CMs. LBP may be useful for treating cardiac diseases such as heart failure, ischemia, and arrhythmia.

"Prairie dogs (genus Cynomys) are a charismatic symbol of the American West. Their large social aggregations and complex vocalizations have been the subject of scientific and popular interest for decades. A large body of literature has documented their role as keystone species of western North America's grasslands: They generate habitat for other vertebrates, increase nutrient availability for plants, and act as a food source for mammalian, squamate, and avian predators. An additional keystone role lies in their extreme susceptibility to sylvatic plague (caused by Yersinia pestis), which results in periodic population extinctions, thereby generating spatiotemporal heterogeneity in both biotic communities and ecological processes. Here, we report the first Cynomys genome for a Gunnison's prairie dog (C. gunnisoni gunnisoni) from Telluride, Colorado (USA). The genome was constructed using a hybrid assembly of PacBio and Illumina reads and assembled with MaSuRCA and PBJelly, which resulted in a scaffold N50 of 824 kb. Total genome size was 2.67 Gb, with 32.46% of the bases occurring in repeat regions. We recovered 94.9% (91% complete) of the single copy orthologs using the mammalian Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs database and detected 49,377 gene models (332,141 coding regions). Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent showed support for long-term stable population size followed by a steady decline beginning near the end of the Pleistocene, as well as a recent population reduction. The genome will aid in studies of mammalian evolution, disease resistance, and the genomic basis of life history traits in ground squirrels.

"During in vitro fertilisation (IVF), pharmacological activation of the murine X chromosome-encoded receptor proteins Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and TLR8 reportedly results in male-biased litters by selectively disrupting the motility of X-bearing sperm cells. Thus-in the context of agonist treatment during IVF-these receptors act as 'suicidal' segregation distorters that impair their own transmission to the next generation. Such behaviour would, from an evolutionary perspective, be strongly selected against if present during natural fertilisation. Consequently, TLR7/8 biology in vivo must differ significantly from this in vitro situation to allow these genes to persist in the genome. Here, we use our current understanding of male germ cell biology and TLR function as a starting point to explore the mechanistic and evolutionary aspects of this apparent paradox.

"Mutations in more than 200 retina-specific genes have been associated with inherited retinal diseases. Genome editing represents a promising emerging field in the treatment of monogenic disorders, as it aims to correct disease-causing mutations within the genome. Genome editing relies on highly specific endonucleases and the capacity of the cells to repair double-strand breaks (DSBs). As DSB pathways are cell-cycle dependent, their activity in postmitotic retinal neurons, with a focus on photoreceptors, needs to be assessed in order to develop therapeutic in vivo genome editing. Three DSB-repair pathways are found in mammalian cells: Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ); microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ); and homology-directed repair (HDR). While NHEJ can be used to knock out mutant alleles in dominant disorders, HDR and MMEJ are better suited for precise genome editing, or for replacing entire mutation hotspots in genomic regions. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic in vivo and in vitro data and revealed that HDR is indeed downregulated in postmitotic neurons, whereas MMEJ and NHEJ are active. Using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we characterized the dynamics of DSB repair pathways in the transition from dividing cells to postmitotic retinal cells. Time-course bulk RNA-seq data confirmed DSB repair gene expression in both in vivo and in vitro samples. Transcriptomic DSB repair pathway profiles are very similar in adult human, macaque, and mouse retinas, but not in ground squirrel retinas. Moreover, human-induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived neurons and retinal organoids can serve as well suited in vitro testbeds for developing genomic engineering approaches in photoreceptors. Our study provides additional support for designing precise in vivo genome-editing approaches via MMEJ, which is active in mature photoreceptors.

"The development of new C-320 electronic-nose (e-nose) methods for pre-symptomatic detection of White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) in bats has required efficacy studies of instrument capabilities to discriminate between major sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from clinical samples. In this phase-2 study, we further tested this e-nose for capabilities to distinguish between bat species based on differences in whole-body VOC emissions. Live healthy individuals of nine bat species were temporarily captured outside of caves in Arkansas and Louisiana. VOC emissions from bats were collected using newly developed portable air collection and sampling-chamber devices in tandem. Sensor-array output responses to bat VOC emissions were compared to those of 22 pure VOC analytical standards from five chemical classes. Distinct smellprint signatures were produced from e-nose analyses of VOC metabolites derived from individual bat species. Smellprint patterns were analyzed using 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to produce aroma map plots showing effective discrimination between bat species with high statistical significance. These results demonstrate potential instrument efficacy for distinguishing between species-specific, bat-derived VOC metabolite emissions as major components of clinical samples collected from bats in caves for disease detection prior to symptom development. This study provided additional information required to fully test the efficacy of a portable e-nose instrument for diagnostic applications in subsequent phase-3 testing of noninvasive, early WNS disease detection in intra-cave hibernating bats.

"Animal studies, mostly performed in rodents, show the beneficial anti-obesity effects of cold studies. This is due to thermogenic activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a tissue also recently discovered in adult humans. Studies in humans, however, are hampered by the accessibility of most tissues. In contrast, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are accessible and share the expression profile of different sets of genes with other tissues, including those that reflect metabolic responses. Ferrets are an animal model physiologically closer to humans than rodents. Here, we investigated the effects on ferrets of one-week acclimation to 4 °C by analysing the PBMC transcriptome. Cold exposure deeply affected PBMC gene expression, producing a widespread down-regulation of genes involved in different biological pathways (cell cycle, gene expression regulation/protein synthesis, immune response, signal transduction, and genes related to extracellular matrix/cytoskeleton), while thermogenic and glycogenolysis-related processes were increased. Results obtained in PBMC reflected those of adipose tissue, but hardly those of the liver. Our study, using ferret as a model, reinforce PBMC usefulness as sentinel biological material for cold-exposure studies in order to deepen our understanding of the general and specific pathways affected by cold acclimation. This is relevant for future development of therapies to be used clinically.

"PURPOSE: To evaluate different methods of studying cone photoreceptor structure in wild-type (WT) and transgenic pigs carrying the human rhodopsin P23H mutant gene (TgP23H). METHODS: For in vivo imaging, pigs were anesthetized with tiletamine-zolazepam and isoflurane and given lidocaine-bupivacaine retrobulbar injections. Stay sutures and a custom head mount were used to hold and steer the head for adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO). Six WT and TgP23H littermates were imaged at postnatal day 30 (P30), P90, and P180 with AOSLO and optical coherence tomography (OCT), and two additional sets of littermates were imaged at P3 and P15 with OCT only. AOSLO imaging and correlative differential interference contrast microscopy were performed on a P240 WT pig and on WT and TgP23H littermates at P30 and P180. RESULTS: AOSLO cone density generally underestimates histology density (mean difference ± SD = 24.8% ± 21.4%). The intensity of the outer retinal hyperreflective OCT band attributed to photoreceptors is attenuated in TgP23H pigs at all ages. In contrast, AOSLO images show cones that retain inner and outer segments through P180. At retinal locations outside the visual streak, TgP23H pigs show a heterogeneous degenerating cone mosaic by using two criteria: variable contrast on a split detector AOSLO and high reflectivity on a confocal AOSLO. CONCLUSIONS: AOSLO reveals that the cone mosaic is similar to ex vivo histology. Its use as a noninvasive tool will enable observation of morphologic changes that arise in the cone mosaic of TgP23H pigs over time. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Pigs are widely used for translational studies, and the ability to noninvasively assess cellular changes in the cone mosaic will facilitate more detailed investigations of new retinal disease models as well as outcomes of potential therapies.

"Nup358 is a protein subunit of the nuclear pore complex that recruits the opposing microtubule motors kinesin-1 and dynein [via the dynein adaptor Bicaudal D2 (BicD2)] to the nuclear envelope. This pathway is important for positioning of the nucleus during the early steps of mitotic spindle assembly and also essential for an important process in brain development. It is unknown whether dynein and kinesin-1 interact with Nup358 simultaneously or whether they compete. Here, we have reconstituted and characterized a minimal complex of kinesin-1 light chain 2 (KLC2) and Nup358. The proteins interact through a W-acidic motif in Nup358, which is highly conserved among vertebrates but absent in insects. While Nup358 and KLC2 form predominantly monomers, their interaction results in the formation of 2:2 complexes, and the W-acidic motif is required for the oligomerization. In active motor complexes, BicD2 and KLC2 each form dimers. Notably, we show that the dynein adaptor BicD2 and KLC2 interact simultaneously with Nup358, resulting in the formation of 2:2:2 complexes. Mutation of the W-acidic motif results in the formation of 1:1:1 complexes. On the basis of our data, we propose that Nup358 recruits simultaneously one kinesin-1 motor and one dynein motor via BicD2 to the nucleus. We hypothesize that the binding sites are close enough to promote direct interactions between these motor recognition domains, which may be important for the regulation of the motility of these opposing motors. Our data provide important insights into a nuclear positioning pathway that is crucial for brain development and faithful chromosome segregation.

"Formed in late 1999, the Rat Genome Database (RGD, https://rgd.mcw.edu) will be 20 in 2020, the Year of the Rat. Because the laboratory rat, Rattus norvegicus, has been used as a model for complex human diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurological disorders and arthritis, among others, for >150 years, RGD has always been disease-focused and committed to providing data and tools for researchers doing comparative genomics and translational studies. At its inception, before the sequencing of the rat genome, RGD started with only a few data types localized on genetic and radiation hybrid (RH) maps and offered only a few tools for querying and consolidating that data. Since that time, RGD has expanded to include a wealth of structured and standardized genetic, genomic, phenotypic, and disease-related data for eight species, and a suite of innovative tools for querying, analyzing and visualizing this data. This article provides an overview of recent substantial additions and improvements to RGD's data and tools that can assist researchers in finding and utilizing the data they need, whether their goal is to develop new precision models of disease or to more fully explore emerging details within a system or across multiple systems.

"In humans high quality, high acuity visual experience is mediated by the fovea, a tiny, specialized patch of retina containing the locus of fixation. Despite this, vision restoration strategies are typically developed in animal models without a fovea. While electrical prostheses have been approved by regulators, as yet they have failed to restore high quality, high acuity vision in patients. Approaches under pre-clinical development include regenerative cell therapies, optogenetics and chemical photosensitizers. All retinal vision restoration therapies require reactivation of inner retina that has lost photoreceptor input and that the restored signals can be interpreted at a behavioural level. A greater emphasis on tackling these challenges at the fovea may accelerate progress toward high quality vision restoration.

"As a natural hibernator, the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) is an ideal and intriguing model to investigate changes in microbial community structure and function caused by hibernation. In this study, we used 16S rRNA profiling and metagenomic analysis to compare the composition, diversity, and functional capacity in the gut microbiome of hibernating vs. active Chinese alligators. Our results show that gut microbial communities undergo seasonal restructuring in response to seasonal cycles of feeding and fasting in the Chinese alligator, but this animal harbors a core gut microbial community primarily dominated by Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes across the gut regions. During hibernation, there is an increase in the abundance of bacterial taxa (e.g., the genus Bacteroides) that can degrade host mucin glycans, which allows adaptation to winter fasting. This is accompanied by the enrichment of mucin oligosaccharide-degrading enzyme and carbohydrate-active enzyme families. In contrast, during the active phase (feeding), active Chinese alligators exhibit a carnivore gut microbiome dominated by Fusobacteria, and there is an increase in the relative abundance of bacteria (e.g., Cetobacterium somerae) with known proteolytic and amino acids-fermentating functions that improve host protein-rich food digestion efficiency. In addition, seasonal variations in the expression of β-defensins play a protective role in intestinal immunity. These findings provide insights into the functional adaptations of host-gut microbe symbioses to seasonal dietary shifts to maintain gut homeostasis and health, especially in extreme physiological states.

"Comparative physiologists are often interested in adaptive physiological phenomena found in unconventional model organisms; however, research on these species is frequently constrained by the limited availability of investigative tools. Here, we propose that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from unconventional model organisms may retain certain species-specific features that can consequently be investigated in depth in vitro; we use hibernating mammals as an example. Many species (including ground squirrels, bats and bears) can enter a prolonged state of physiological dormancy known as hibernation to survive unfavorable seasonal conditions. Our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the rapid transition and adaptation to a hypothermic, metabolically suppressed winter torpor state remains limited partially because of the lack of an easily accessible model. To address the fascinating unanswered questions underlying hibernation biology, we have developed a powerful model system: iPSCs from a hibernating species, the thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). These stem cells can potentially be differentiated into any cell type, and can be used for the analysis of cell-autonomous mechanisms that facilitate adaptation to hibernation and for comparisons with non-hibernators. Furthermore, we can manipulate candidate molecular and cellular pathways underlying relevant physiological phenomena by pharmacological or RNAi-based methods, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Moreover, iPSC strategies can be applied to other species (e.g. seals, naked mole rats, humming birds) for in vitro studies on adaptation to extreme physiological conditions. In this Commentary, we discuss factors to consider when attempting to generate iPSCs from unconventional model organisms, based on our experience with the thirteen-lined ground squirrel.

"STK38 (also known as NDR1) is a Hippo pathway serine/threonine protein kinase with multifarious functions in normal and cancer cells. Using a context-dependent proximity-labeling assay, we identify more than 250 partners of STK38 and find that STK38 modulates its partnership depending on the cellular context by increasing its association with cytoplasmic proteins upon nutrient starvation-induced autophagy and with nuclear ones during ECM detachment. We show that STK38 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and that its nuclear exit depends on both XPO1 (aka exportin-1, CRM1) and STK38 kinase activity. We further uncover that STK38 modulates XPO1 export activity by phosphorylating XPO1 on serine 1055, thus regulating its own nuclear exit. We expand our model to other cellular contexts by discovering that XPO1 phosphorylation by STK38 regulates also the nuclear exit of Beclin1 and YAP1, key regulator of autophagy and transcriptional effector, respectively. Collectively, our results reveal STK38 as an activator of XPO1, behaving as a gatekeeper of nuclear export. These observations establish a novel mechanism of XPO1-dependent cargo export regulation by phosphorylation of XPO1's C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain.

"Sequences derived from parvoviruses (family Parvoviridae) are relatively common in animal genomes, but the functional significance of these endogenous parvoviral element (EPV) sequences remains unclear. In this study, we used a combination of in silico and molecular biological approaches to investigate a fusion gene carried by guinea pigs (genus Cavia) that is partially derived from an EPV. This gene, named enRep-M9l, encodes a predicted polypeptide gene product comprising a partial myosin9-like (M9l) gene fused to a 3' truncated, EPV-encoded replicase. We examined the genomic and phylogenetic characteristics of the EPV locus (enRep) that encodes the viral portions of enRep-M9l, revealing that it derives from an ancient dependoparvovirus (genus Dependoparvovirus) that was incorporated into the guinea pig germ line between approximately 22 and 35 million years ago (MYA). Despite these ancient origins, the regions of the enRep locus that are expressed in the enRep-M9l gene are conserved across multiple species in the family Caviidae (guinea pigs and cavies), consistent with a potential function at the amino acid level. Using molecular biological approaches, we further demonstrated that (i) enRep-M9l mRNA is broadly transcribed in guinea pig cells, (ii) the cloned enRep-M9l transcript can express a protein of the expected size in guinea pig cells in vitro, and (iii) the expressed protein localizes to the cytosol. Our findings demonstrate that, consistent with a functional role, the enRep-M9l fusion gene is evolutionarily conserved, broadly transcribed, and capable of expressing protein.IMPORTANCE DNA from viruses has been ""horizontally transferred"" to mammalian genomes during evolution, but the impact of this process on mammalian biology remains poorly understood. The findings of our study indicate that a novel gene has evolved in guinea pigs through fusion of host and virus genes.

"Bats, unique among mammals with powered flight, have many species with the longest size-proportionate lifespan of all mammals. Evolutionary adaptations would have been required to survive the elevated body temperatures during flight. Heat shock protein (HSP), highly conserved master regulators of cell stress, expression was examined across tissues and various cell lines in bats. Basal expression level of major HSPs (HSP70 and HSP90) is significantly higher in two different bat species compared to other mammals. This HSP expression could be a bat-unique, key factor to modulate cellular stress and death. Consequently, bat cells survive prolonged heat treatment, along with other stress stimuli, in a HSP-dependent manner, whereas other mammalian cells succumbed. This suggests HSP expression in bats could be an important adaption to intrinsic metabolic stresses like flight and therefore an important model to study stress resilience and longevity in general.

"Endogenous viral elements (EVEs) can play a significant role in the evolution of their hosts and have been identified in animals, plants, and fungi. Additionally, EVEs potentially provide an important snapshot of the evolutionary frequency of viral infection. The purpose of this study is to take a comparative host-centered approach to EVE discovery in ant genomes to better understand the relationship of EVEs to their ant hosts. Using a comprehensive bioinformatic pipeline, we screened all nineteen published ant genomes for EVEs. Once the EVEs were identified, we assessed their phylogenetic relationships to other closely related exogenous viruses. A diverse group of EVEs were discovered in all screened ant host genomes and in many cases are similar to previously identified exogenous viruses. EVEs similar to ssRNA viral proteins are the most common viral lineage throughout the ant hosts, which is potentially due to more chronic infection or more effective endogenization of certain ssRNA viruses in ants. In addition, both EVEs similar to viral glycoproteins and retrovirus-derived proteins are also abundant throughout ant genomes, suggesting their tendency to endogenize. Several of these newly discovered EVEs are found to be potentially functional within the genome. The discovery and analysis of EVEs is essential in beginning to understand viral-ant interactions over evolutionary time.

"BACKGROUND: Neural stem cell (NSC)-based therapies hold great promise for treating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). However, several fundamental problems still need to be overcome to fully exploit the clinical potential of NSC therapeutics. Chief among them is the limited survival of NSC grafts within hostile microenvironments. METHODS: Herein, we sought to engineer NSCs in an effort to increase graft survival within ischemic brain lesions via upregulation of global SUMOylation, a post-translational modification critically involved in mediating tolerance to ischemia/reperfusion. FINDINGS: NSCs overexpressing the SUMO E2-conjugase Ubc9 displayed resistance to oxygen-glucose-deprivation/restoration of oxygen/glucose (OGD/ROG) and enhanced neuronal differentiation in vitro, as well as increased survival and neuronal differentiation when transplanted in mice with transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in vivo. INTERPRETATION: Our work highlights a critical role for SUMOylation in NSC biology and identifies a biological pathway that can be targeted to increase the effectiveness of exogenous stem cell medicines in ischemic stroke.

"Arthropod genomes contain sequences derived from integrations of DNA and nonretroviral RNA viruses. These sequences, known as endogenous viral elements (EVEs), have been acquired over the course of evolution and have been proposed to serve as a record of past viral infections. Recent evidence indicates that EVEs can function as templates for the biogenesis of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in some mosquito species and cell lines, raising the possibility that EVEs may serve as a source of immunological memory in these organisms. However, whether piRNAs are derived from EVEs or serve an antiviral function in other arthropod species is unknown. Here, we used publicly available genome assemblies and small RNA sequencing data sets to characterize the repertoire and function of EVEs across 48 arthropod genomes. We found that EVEs are widespread in arthropod genomes and primarily correspond to unclassified single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses and viruses belonging to the Rhabdoviridae and Parvoviridae families. Additionally, EVEs were enriched in piRNA clusters in a majority of species, and we found that production of primary piRNAs from EVEs is common, particularly for EVEs located within piRNA clusters. While the abundance of EVEs within arthropod genomes and the frequency with which EVEs give rise to primary piRNAs generally support the hypothesis that EVEs contribute to an antiviral response via the piRNA pathway, limited nucleotide identity between currently described viruses and EVEs identified here likely limits the extent to which this process plays a role during infection with known viruses in the arthropod species analyzed.IMPORTANCE Our results greatly expand the knowledge of EVE abundance, diversity, and function in an exceptionally wide range of arthropod species. We found that while previous findings in mosquitoes regarding the potential of EVEs to serve as sources of immunological memory via the piRNA pathway may be generalized to other arthropod species, speculation regarding the antiviral function of EVE-derived piRNAs should take into context the fact that EVEs are, in the vast majority of cases, not similar enough to currently described viruses at the nucleotide level to serve as sources of antiviral piRNAs against them.

"Targeting of viral proteins to specific subcellular compartments is a fundamental step for viruses to achieve successful replication in infected cells. Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), a nonsegmented, negative-strand RNA virus, uniquely replicates and persists in the cell nucleus. Here, it is demonstrated that BoDV nucleoprotein (N) transcripts undergo mRNA splicing to generate truncated isoforms. In combination with alternative usage of translation initiation sites, the N gene potentially expresses at least six different isoforms, which exhibit diverse intracellular localizations, including the nucleoplasm, cytoplasm, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), as well as intranuclear viral replication sites. Interestingly, the ER-targeting signal peptide in N is exposed by removing the intron by mRNA splicing. Furthermore, the spliced isoforms inhibit viral polymerase activity. Consistently, recombinant BoDVs lacking the N-splicing signals acquire the ability to replicate faster than wild-type virus in cultured cells, suggesting that N isoforms created by mRNA splicing negatively regulate BoDV replication. These results provided not only the mechanism of how mRNA splicing generates viral proteins that have distinct functions but also a novel strategy for replication control of RNA viruses using isoforms with different subcellular localizations.
IMPORTANCE Borna disease virus (BoDV) is a highly neurotropic RNA virus that belongs to the orthobornavirus genus. A zoonotic orthobornavirus that is genetically related to BoDV has recently been identified in squirrels, thus increasing the importance of understanding the replication and pathogenesis of orthobornaviruses. BoDV replicates in the nucleus and uses alternative mRNA splicing to express viral proteins. However, it is unknown whether the virus uses splicing to create protein isoforms with different functions. The present study demonstrated that the nucleoprotein transcript undergoes splicing and produces four new isoforms in coordination with alternative usage of translation initiation codons. The spliced isoforms showed a distinct intracellular localization, including in the endoplasmic reticulum, and recombinant viruses lacking the splicing signals replicated more efficiently than the wild type. The results provided not only a new regulation of BoDV replication but also insights into how RNA viruses produce protein isoforms from small genomes."
"Virus-derived sequences and transposable elements constitute a substantial portion of many cellular genomes. Recent insights reveal the intimate evolutionary relationship between these sequences and various cellular immune pathways. At the most basic level, superinfection exclusion may be considered a prototypical virus-mediated immune system that has been described in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. More complex immune mechanisms fully or partially derived from mobile genetic elements include CRISPR-Cas of prokaryotes and the RAG1/2 system of vertebrates, which provide immunological memory of foreign genetic elements and generate antibody and T cell receptor diversity, respectively. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the contribution of mobile genetic elements to the evolution of cellular immune pathways. A picture is emerging in which the various cellular immune systems originate from and are spread by viruses and transposable elements. Immune systems likely evolved from simple superinfection exclusion to highly complex defense strategies.

"Summaries of taxonomic knowledge are provided for all acarine groups in Canada, accompanied by references to relevant publications, changes in classification at the family level since 1979, and notes on biology relevant to estimating their diversity. Nearly 3000 described species from 269 families are recorded in the country, representing a 56% increase from the 1917 species reported by Lindquist et al. (1979). An additional 42 families are known from Canada only from material identified to family- or genus-level. Of the total 311 families known in Canada, 69 are newly recorded since 1979, excluding apparent new records due solely to classification changes. This substantial progress is most evident in Oribatida and Hydrachnidia, for which many regional checklists and family-level revisions have been published. Except for recent taxonomic leaps in a few other groups, particularly of symbiotic mites (Astigmata: feather mites; Mesostigmata: Rhinonyssidae), knowledge remains limited for most other taxa, for which most species records are unpublished and may require verification. Taxonomic revisions are greatly needed for a large majority of families in Canada. Based in part on species recorded in adjacent areas of the USA and on hosts known to be present here, we conservatively estimate that nearly 10,000 species of mites occur in Canada, but the actual number could be 15,000 or more. This means that at least 70% of Canada's mite fauna is yet unrecorded. Much work also remains to match existing molecular data with species names, as less than 10% of the ~7500 Barcode Index Numbers for Canadian mites in the Barcode of Life Database are associated with named species. Understudied hosts and terrestrial and aquatic habitats require investigation across Canada to uncover new species and to clarify geographic and ecological distributions of known species.

"Monkeypox is a re-emerging viral zoonosis that occurs naturally in heavily forested regions of West and Central Africa. Inter-human transmission of monkeypox virus, although limited, drives outbreaks, particularly in household and health-care settings. But the available evidence suggests that without repeated zoonotic introductions, human infections would eventually cease to occur. Therefore, interrupting virus transmission from animals to humans is key to combating this disease. Areas covered: Herein we review laboratory and field studies examining the susceptibility of various animal taxa to monkeypox virus infection, and note the competence of various species to serve as reservoirs or transmission hosts. In addition, we discuss early socio-ecologic theories of monkeypox virus transmission in rural settings and review current modes of ecologic investigation - including ecologic niche modeling, and ecologic sampling - in light of their potential to identify specific animal species and features of the environment that are associated with heightened risk for human disease. Expert opinion: The role of disease ecology and scientific research in ongoing disease prevention efforts should be reinforced, particularly for wildlife-associated zoonoses such as monkeypox. Such efforts alongside those aimed at nurturing 'One Health' collaborations may ultimately hold the greatest promise for reducing human infections with this pathogen.

"The causes and consequences of vertebrate natal dispersal have been studied extensively, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. We used RNA-seq to quantify transcriptomic gene expression in blood of wild yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) prior to dispersing from or remaining philopatric to their natal colony. We tested 3 predictions. First, we hypothesized dispersers and residents will differentially express genes and gene networks since dispersal is physiologically demanding. Second, we expected differentially expressed genes to be involved in metabolism, circadian processes, and immune function. Finally, in dispersing individuals, we predicted differentially expressed genes would change as a function of sampling date relative to dispersal date. We detected 150 differentially expressed genes, including genes that have critical roles in lipid metabolism and antigen defense. Gene network analysis revealed a module of 126 coexpressed genes associated with dispersal that was enriched for extracellular immune function. Of the dispersal-associated genes, 22 altered expression as a function of days until dispersal, suggesting that dispersal-associated genes do not initiate transcription on the same time scale. Our results provide novel insights into the fundamental molecular changes required for dispersal and suggest evolutionary conservation of functional pathways during this behavioral process.

"RNA editing diversifies genomically encoded information to expand the complexity of the transcriptome. In ectothermic organisms, including Drosophila and Cephalopoda, where body temperature mirrors ambient temperature, decreases in environmental temperature lead to increases in A-to-I RNA editing and cause amino acid recoding events that are thought to be adaptive responses to temperature fluctuations. In contrast, endothermic mammals, including humans and mice, typically maintain a constant body temperature despite environmental changes. Here, A-to-I editing primarily targets repeat elements, rarely results in the recoding of amino acids, and plays a critical role in innate immune tolerance. Hibernating ground squirrels provide a unique opportunity to examine RNA editing in a heterothermic mammal whose body temperature varies over 30°C and can be maintained at 5°C for many days during torpor. We profiled the transcriptome in three brain regions at six physiological states to quantify RNA editing and determine whether cold-induced RNA editing modifies the transcriptome as a potential mechanism for neuroprotection at low temperature during hibernation. We identified 5165 A-to-I editing sites in 1205 genes with dynamically increased editing after prolonged cold exposure. The majority (99.6%) of the cold-increased editing sites are outside of previously annotated coding regions, 82.7% lie in SINE-derived repeats, and 12 sites are predicted to recode amino acids. Additionally, A-to-I editing frequencies increase with increasing cold-exposure, demonstrating that ADAR remains active during torpor. Our findings suggest that dynamic A-to-I editing at low body temperature may provide a neuroprotective mechanism to limit aberrant dsRNA accumulation during torpor in the mammalian hibernator.

"Haploinsufficiency of the SHANK3 gene, encoding for a scaffolding protein located in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapse, has been linked to forms of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). It has been shown that SHANK3 controls the maturation of social reward circuits in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Whether the impairments in associative learning observed in ASD relate to SHANK3 insufficiency restricted to the reward system is still an open question. Here, we first characterize a social-conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm based on the direct and free interaction with a juvenile and non-familiar conspecific. In both group- and single-housed C57Bl6/j late adolescence male mice, this CPP protocol promotes the formation of social-induced contextual associations that undergo extinction. Interestingly, the downregulation of Shank3 expression in the VTA altered the habituation to a non-familiar conspecific during conditioning and accelerated the extinction of social-induced conditioned responses. Thus, inspired by the literature on drugs of abuse-induced contextual learning, we propose that acquisition and extinction of CPP might be used as behavioral assays to assess social-induced contextual association and ""social-seeking"" dysfunctions in animal models of psychiatric disorders.

"The alpha diversity of ecologic communities is affected by many biotic and abiotic drivers and, in turn, affects ecosystem functioning. Yet, patterns of alpha diversity in host-associated microbial communities (microbiomes) are poorly studied and the appropriateness of general theory is untested. Expanding diversity theory to include microbiomes is essential as diversity is a frequently cited metric of their status. Here, we review and newly analyze reports of alpha diversity for animal gut microbiomes. We demonstrate that both diet and body size affect diversity in the gut but that gut physiology (fermenter versus simple) is the most important driver. We also assess the advantages of various diversity metrics. The importance of diversity in microbiomes is often assumed but has not been tested outright. Therefore, we close by discussing how to integrate microbiomes into the field of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning to more clearly understand when and why a host supports diverse microbial communities.

"Non-retroviral integrated RNA viral sequences (NIRVs) potentially encoding ∼280 amino acid homologs to filovirus VP35 proteins are present across the Myotis genus of bats. These are estimated to have been maintained for ∼18 million years, indicating their co-option. To address the reasons for co-option, 16 Myotis VP35s were characterized in comparison to VP35s from the extant filoviruses Ebola virus and Marburg virus, in which VP35s play critical roles in immune evasion and RNA synthesis. The Myotis VP35s demonstrated a conserved suppression of innate immune signaling, albeit with reduced potency, in either human or Myotis cells. Their attenuation reflects a lack of dsRNA binding that in the filoviral VP35s correlates with potent suppression of interferon responses. Despite divergent function, evolution has preserved in Myotis the structure of the filoviral VP35s, indicating that this structure is critical for co-opted function, possibly as a regulator of innate immune signaling.

"An interferon-mediated antiviral protein, 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase 2, plays an important role in the antiviral response of interferons. In this study, 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase 2 genes were cloned from Chinese domestic pigs. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the 2024-bp long open reading fame encodes 707 amino acids. There are two conserved regions in this protein: the nucleotidyltransferase domain, and the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase domain (OAS). Genetic evolution analysis showed that the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase 2 gene in domestic pigs is closely related to that of cattle. There are multiple antigenic sites, no signal peptide, and no transmembrane region in the gene, which is predicted to be a hydrophilic protein. Secondary structures were found to be mainly alpha helix-based; its tertiary structure is close to that of humans and cattle, but not that of mice. Tissue distribution results indicated that this protein is distributed in multiple organs, with high distribution in the liver; it is mainly localized in the cytoplasm. PRRSV infection, interferon-beta, and Poly(I: C) treatment all promoted 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase 2 gene expression. Overexpression and RNA silencing of porcine OAS2 inhibited and promoted PRRSV replication in cells, respectively. The inhibitory effect of porcine OAS2 was mainly dependent on RNase L, similar to what was predicted. This study has laid the foundation for future antiviral studies in pig, and provided a new way of preventing and treating PRRSV in the future.

"The identity of most functional elements in the mammalian genome and the phenotypes they impact are unclear. Here, we perform a genome-wide comparative analysis of patterns of accelerated evolution in species with highly distinctive traits to discover candidate functional elements for clinically important phenotypes. We identify accelerated regions (ARs) in the elephant, hibernating bat, orca, dolphin, naked mole rat, and thirteen-lined ground squirrel lineages in mammalian conserved regions, uncovering ∼33,000 elements that bind hundreds of different regulatory proteins in humans and mice. ARs in the elephant, the largest land mammal, are uniquely enriched near elephant DNA damage response genes. The genomic hotspot for elephant ARs is the E3 ligase subunit of the Fanconi anemia complex, a master regulator of DNA repair. Additionally, ARs in the six species are associated with specific human clinical phenotypes that have apparent concordance with overt traits in each species.

"Hibernating 13-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus; TLGS) rank among the most brain hypoperfusion-tolerant mammals known. Herein we provide some evidence of cycling between an epithelial phenotype and a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype (partial EMT) within the brains of TLGS during each bout of hibernation torpor. During hibernation torpor, expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (E-CDH) was reduced, while expression of the well-known mesenchymal markers vimentin and Sox2 were increased. P-cadherin (P-CDH), which has recently been proposed as a marker of intermediate/partial EMT, also increased during torpor, suggesting that a partial EMT may be taking place during hibernation torpor. Members of the miR-200 family and miR-182 cluster and Akt isoforms (Akt1, Akt2), well-known EMT regulators, were also differentially regulated in the TLGS brain during hibernation bouts. Using SHSY5Y cells, we also demonstrate that the Akt1/Akt2 ratio determined the expression levels of miR-200/miR-182 miRNA family members, and that these miRNAs controlled the expression of EMT-related proteins. Accordingly, we propose that such cell state transitions (EMT/MET) may be one of the mechanisms underlying the extraordinary ischemic tolerance of the TLGS brain during hibernation bouts; hibernator brain cells appear to enter reversible states that confer the stress survival characteristics of cancer cells without the risk of neoplastic transformation.

"The human CST (Ctc1, Stn1 and Ten1) complex binds the telomeric overhang and regulates telomere length by promoting C-strand replication and inhibiting telomerase-dependent G-strand synthesis. Structural and biochemical studies on the human Stn1 and Ten1 complex revealed its mechanism of assembly and nucleic acid binding. However, little is known about the structural organization of the multi-domain Ctc1 protein and how each of these domains contribute to telomere length regulation. Here, we report the structure of a central domain of human Ctc1. The structure reveals a canonical OB-fold with the two identified disease mutations (R840W and V871M) contributing to the fold of the protein. In vitro assays suggest that although this domain is not contributing directly to Ctc1's substrate binding properties, it affects full-length Ctc1 localization to telomeres and Stn1-Ten1 binding. Moreover, functional assays show that deletion of the entire OB-fold domain leads to significant increase in telomere length, frequency of internal single G-strands and fragile telomeres. Our findings demonstrate that a previously unknown OB-fold domain contributes to efficient Ctc1 telomere localization and chromosome end maintenance.

"Evolutionary variations generating phenotypic adaptations and novel taxa resulted from complex cellular activities altering genome content and expression: (i) Symbiogenetic cell mergers producing the mitochondrion-bearing ancestor of eukaryotes and chloroplast-bearing ancestors of photosynthetic eukaryotes; (ii) interspecific hybridizations and genome doublings generating new species and adaptive radiations of higher plants and animals; and, (iii) interspecific horizontal DNA transfer encoding virtually all of the cellular functions between organisms and their viruses in all domains of life. Consequently, assuming that evolutionary processes occur in isolated genomes of individual species has become an unrealistic abstraction. Adaptive variations also involved natural genetic engineering of mobile DNA elements to rewire regulatory networks. In the most highly evolved organisms, biological complexity scales with ""non-coding"" DNA content more closely than with protein-coding capacity. Coincidentally, we have learned how so-called ""non-coding"" RNAs that are rich in repetitive mobile DNA sequences are key regulators of complex phenotypes. Both biotic and abiotic ecological challenges serve as triggers for episodes of elevated genome change. The intersections of cell activities, biosphere interactions, horizontal DNA transfers, and non-random Read-Write genome modifications by natural genetic engineering provide a rich molecular and biological foundation for understanding how ecological disruptions can stimulate productive, often abrupt, evolutionary transformations.

"The mammalian gut microbiota has been linked to host developmental, immunologic, and metabolic outcomes. This collection of trillions of microbes inhabits the gut and produces a myriad of metabolites, which are measurable in host circulation and contribute to the pathogenesis of human diseases. The link between endogenous metabolite availability and chromatin regulation is a well-established and active area of investigation; however, whether microbial metabolites can elicit similar effects is less understood. In this review, we focus on seminal and recent research that establishes chromatin regulatory roles for both endogenous and microbial metabolites. We also highlight key physiologic and disease settings where microbial metabolite-host chromatin interactions have been established and/or may be pertinent.

"Strong DNA conservation among divergent species is an indicator of enduring functionality. With weaker sequence conservation we enter a vast 'twilight zone' in which sequence subject to transient or lower constraint cannot be distinguished easily from neutrally evolving, non-functional sequence. Twilight zone functional sequence is illuminated instead by principles of selective constraint and positive selection using genomic data acquired from within a species' population. Application of these principles reveals that despite being biochemically active, most twilight zone sequence is not functional.

"Cytauxzoonosis is an emerging infectious disease that affects wild felids as well as the domestic cat; it is caused by the apicomplexan protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Cytauxzoon. Cytauxzoonfelis is the species of major concern, whose transmission occurs via the bite of an infected tick. Cytauxzoonosis of the domestic cat has historically been considered uniformly fatal, with a short course of illness, and most domestic cats die within 9 to 15 days postinfection. However, increasing evidence of domestic cats surviving C. felis infection suggests the existence of different strains with various levels of pathogenicity. Although wild felids are considered natural reservoirs for this parasite, a number of studies suggest that domestic cats that have survived nonlethal infections may serve as an additional reservoir. The current article comprehensively reviews the parasite and its life cycle, geographic distribution, genetic variability, and pathogenesis, as well as host immunology and the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infection in the domestic cat. This information should provide a basis for better understanding the parasite as well as the pathogenesis of the disease.

"The formation of mineralized tissues is governed by extracellular matrix proteins that assemble into a 3D organic matrix directing the deposition of hydroxyapatite. Although the formation of bones and dentin depends on the self-assembly of type I collagen via the Gly-X-Y motif, the molecular mechanism by which enamel matrix proteins (EMPs) assemble into the organic matrix remains poorly understood. Here we identified a Y/F-x-x-Y/L/F-x-Y/F motif, evolutionarily conserved from the first tetrapods to man, that is crucial for higher order structure self-assembly of the key intrinsically disordered EMPs, ameloblastin and amelogenin. Using targeted mutations in mice and high-resolution imaging, we show that impairment of ameloblastin self-assembly causes disorganization of the enamel organic matrix and yields enamel with disordered hydroxyapatite crystallites. These findings define a paradigm for the molecular mechanism by which the EMPs self-assemble into supramolecular structures and demonstrate that this process is crucial for organization of the organic matrix and formation of properly structured enamel.

"LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons are dynamic elements. They have the potential to cause great genomic change because of their ability to 'jump' around the genome and amplify themselves, resulting in the duplication and rearrangement of regulatory DNA. Active L1, in particular, are often thought of as tightly constrained, homologous and ubiquitous elements with well-characterized domain organization. For the past 30 years, model organisms have been used to define L1s as 6-8 kb sequences containing a 5'-UTR, two open reading frames working harmoniously in cis, and a 3'-UTR with a polyA tail. In this study, we demonstrate the remarkable and overlooked diversity of L1s via a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of elements from over 500 species from widely divergent branches of the tree of life. The rapid and recent growth of L1 elements in mammalian species is juxtaposed against the diverse lineages found in other metazoans and plants. In fact, some of these previously unexplored mammalian species (e.g. snub-nosed monkey, minke whale) exhibit L1 retrotranspositional 'hyperactivity' far surpassing that of human or mouse. In contrast, non-mammalian L1s have become so varied that the current classification system seems to inadequately capture their structural characteristics. Our findings illustrate how both long-term inherited evolutionary patterns and random bursts of activity in individual species can significantly alter genomes, highlighting the importance of L1 dynamics in eukaryotes.

"Mammalian colour patterns are among the most recognizable characteristics found in nature and can have a profound impact on fitness. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the formation and subsequent evolution of these patterns. Here we show that, in the African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio), periodic dorsal stripes result from underlying differences in melanocyte maturation, which give rise to spatial variation in hair colour. We identify the transcription factor ALX3 as a regulator of this process. In embryonic dorsal skin, patterned expression of Alx3 precedes pigment stripes and acts to directly repress Mitf, a master regulator of melanocyte differentiation, thereby giving rise to light-coloured hair. Moreover, Alx3 is upregulated in the light stripes of chipmunks, which have independently evolved a similar dorsal pattern. Our results show a previously undescribed mechanism for modulating spatial variation in hair colour and provide insights into how phenotypic novelty evolves.

"If a freshly minted genome contains a mutation that confers drug resistance, will it be selected in the presence of the drug? Not necessarily. During viral infections, newly synthesized viral genomes occupy the same cells as parent and other progeny genomes. If the antiviral target is chosen so that the drug-resistant progeny's growth is dominantly inhibited by the drug-susceptible members of its intracellular family, its outgrowth can be suppressed. Precedent for 'dominant drug targeting' as a deliberate approach to suppress the outgrowth of inhibitor-resistant viruses has been established for envelope variants of vesicular stomatitis virus and for capsid variants of poliovirus and dengue virus. Small molecules that stabilize oligomeric assemblages are a promising means to an unfit family to destroy the effectiveness of a newborn drug-resistant relative due to the co-assembly of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant monomers.

"Endogenous bornavirus-like nucleoprotein elements (EBLNs), the nucleotide sequence elements derived from the nucleoprotein gene of ancient bornavirus-like viruses, have been identified in many animal genomes. Here we show evidence that EBLNs encode functional proteins in their host. Some afrotherian EBLNs were observed to have been maintained for more than 83.3 million years under negative selection. Splice variants were expressed from the genomic loci of EBLNs in elephant, and some were translated into proteins. The EBLN proteins appeared to be localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in African elephant cells, in contrast to the nuclear localization of bornavirus N. These observations suggest that afrotherian EBLNs have acquired a novel function in their host. Interestingly, genomic sequences of the first exon and its flanking regions in these EBLN loci were homologous to those of transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B). The upstream region of the first exon in the EBLN loci exhibited a promoter activity, suggesting that the ability of these EBLNs to be transcribed in the host cell was gained through capturing a partial duplicate of TMEM106B. In conclusion, our results strongly support for exaptation of EBLNs to encode host proteins in afrotherians.

"A defined set of genetic instructions encodes functionality in complex organisms. Delineating these unique genetic signatures is essential to understanding the formation and functionality of specialized tissues. Vision, one of the five central senses of perception, is initiated by the retina and has evolved over time to produce rod and cone photoreceptors that vary in a species-specific manner, and in some cases by geographical region resulting in higher order visual acuity in humans. RNA-sequencing and use of existing and de novo transcriptome assemblies allowed ocular transcriptome mapping from a diverse set of rodent and primate species. Global genomic refinements along with systems-based comparative and co-expression analyses of these transcriptome maps identified gene modules that correlated with specific features of rod versus cone retinal cellular composition. Organization of the ocular transcriptome demonstrated herein defines the molecular basis of photoreceptor architecture and functionality, providing a new paradigm for neurogenetic analyses of the mammalian retina in health and disease.

"Bats of the genus Eptesicus have several non-retroviral RNA virus-derived sequences in their genomes, among which an endogenous bornavirus-like L element, named eEBLL-1, was suggested to encode functional proteins in the hosts. However, the function of eEBLL-1 remains unclear due to a lack of appropriate investigation tools, such as cultured cells expressing eEBLL-1. Here, we established a continuous cell line, named HAMOI-EnK cells, from kidney of Eptesicus nilssonii. HAMOI-EnK cells are robust and could be passaged for at least 10 months. eEBLL-1 in the genomes of HAMOI-EnK cells retains an intact open reading frame. Additionally, eEBLL-1 is transcribed in the sense-orientation in cells. To our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that eEBLL-1 is transcribed in cultured cells.

"How the kidney responds to the metabolic cues from the environment remains a central question in kidney research. This question is particularly relevant to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) in which evidence suggests that metabolic events in podocytes regulate chromatin structure. Here, we show that miR-93 is a critical metabolic/epigenetic switch in the diabetic milieu linking the metabolic state to chromatin remodelling. Mice with inducible overexpression of a miR-93 transgene exclusively in podocytes exhibit significant improvements in key features of DN. We identify miR-93 as a regulator of nucleosomal dynamics in podocytes. miR-93 has a critical role in chromatin reorganization and progression of DN by modulating its target Msk2, a histone kinase, and its substrate H3S10. These findings implicate a central role for miR-93 in high glucose-induced chromatin remodelling in the kidney, and provide evidence for a previously unrecognized role for Msk2 as a target for DN therapy.

"Amongst the 11 eutherian-specific genes acquired from a sushi-ichi retrotransposon is the CCHC type zinc-finger protein-encoding gene SIRH11/ZCCHC16. Its contribution to eutherian brain evolution is implied because of its involvement in cognitive function in mice, possibly via the noradrenergic system. Although, the possibility that Sirh11/Zcchc16 functions as a non-coding RNA still remains, dN/dS ratios in pairwise comparisons between its orthologs have provided supportive evidence that it acts as a protein. It became a pseudogene in armadillos (Cingulata) and sloths (Pilosa), the only two extant orders of xenarthra, which prompted us to examine the lineage-specific variations of SIRH11/ZCCHC16 in eutherians. We examined the predicted SIRH11/ZCCHC16 open reading frame (ORF) in 95 eutherian species based on the genomic DNA information in GenBank. A large variation in the SIRH11/ZCCHC16 ORF was detected in several lineages. These include a lack of a CCHC RNA-binding domain in its C-terminus, observed in gibbons (Hylobatidae: Primates) and megabats (Megachiroptera: Chiroptera). A lack of the N-terminal half, on the other hand, was observed in New World monkeys (Platyrrhini: Primates) and species belonging to New World and African Hystricognaths (Caviomorpha and Bathyergidae: Rodents) along with Cetacea and Ruminantia (Cetartiodactyla). Among the hominoids, interestingly, three out of four genera of gibbons have lost normal SIRH11/ZCCHC16 function by deletion or the lack of the CCHC RNA-binding domain. Our extensive dN/dS analysis suggests that such truncated SIRH11/ZCCHC16 ORFs are functionally diversified even within lineages. Combined, our results show that SIRH11/ZCCHC16 may contribute to the diversification of eutherians by lineage-specific structural changes after its domestication in the common eutherian ancestor, followed by putative species-specific functional changes that enhanced fitness and occurred as a consequence of complex natural selection events.

"Cellular proteomes are continuously undergoing alterations as a result of new production of proteins, protein folding, and degradation of proteins. The proper equilibrium of these processes is known as proteostasis, implying that proteomes are in homeostasis. Stress conditions can affect proteostasis due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins as a result of overloading the degradation machinery. Proteostasis is affected in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple polyglutamine disorders including Huntington's disease. Owing to a lack of proteostasis, neuronal cells build up toxic protein aggregates in these diseases. Here, we review the role of the ubiquitin-like posttranslational modification SUMO in proteostasis. SUMO alone contributes to protein homeostasis by influencing protein signaling or solubility. However, the main contribution of SUMO to proteostasis is the ability to cooperate with, complement, and balance the ubiquitin-proteasome system at multiple levels. We discuss the identification of enzymes involved in the interplay between SUMO and ubiquitin, exploring the complexity of this crosstalk which regulates proteostasis. These enzymes include SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin proteases counteracting these ligases. Additionally, we review the role of SUMO in brain-related diseases, where SUMO is primarily investigated because of its role during formation of aggregates, either independently or in cooperation with ubiquitin. Detailed understanding of the role of SUMO in these diseases could lead to novel treatment options.

"Fertilization is an essential biological process in sexual reproduction and comprises a series of molecular interactions between the sperm and egg. The fusion of the haploid spermatozoon and oocyte is the culminating event in mammalian fertilization, enabling the creation of a new, genetically distinct diploid organism. The merger of two gametes is achieved through a two-step mechanism in which the sperm protein IZUMO1 on the equatorial segment of the acrosome-reacted sperm recognizes its receptor, JUNO, on the egg surface. This recognition is followed by the fusion of the two plasma membranes. IZUMO1 and JUNO proteins are indispensable for fertilization, as constitutive knockdown of either protein results in mice that are healthy but infertile. Despite their central importance in reproductive medicine, the molecular architectures of these proteins and the details of their functional roles in fertilization are not known. Here we present the crystal structures of human IZUMO1 and JUNO in unbound and bound conformations. The human IZUMO1 structure exhibits a distinct boomerang shape and provides structural insights into the IZUMO family of proteins. Human IZUMO1 forms a high-affinity complex with JUNO and undergoes a major conformational change within its N-terminal domain upon binding to the egg-surface receptor. Our results provide insights into the molecular basis of sperm-egg recognition, cross-species fertilization, and the barrier to polyspermy, thereby promising benefits for the rational development of non-hormonal contraceptives and fertility treatments for humans and other mammals.

"The putative neuroprotective properties of various flavonoids have long been reported. Among this class of chemicals, quercetin, a major flavone/flavonol naturally occurring in plants, deserves focused attention because of the myriad of beneficial effects observed in various in vitro and in vivo models of central nervous system damage/degeneration. However, the mechanisms governing the beneficial outcomes mediated by quercetin remain to be elucidated. In an effort to define the underlying molecular mechanisms, our study employed human/rat neuroblastoma cell lines (SHSY5Y and B35, respectively) and E18-derived rat primary cortical neurons upon which the effects of various flavonoids were examined. Of note, increases in the levels of global SUMOylation, a post-translational modification with the Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) were pronounced. Quercetin treatment increased SUMOylation levels in both SHSY5Y cells and rat cortical neurons in a dose and time-dependent manner, possibly via the direct inactivation of certain SENPs (SUMO-specific isopeptidases). Of particular interest, cells treated with quercetin displayed increased tolerance to oxygen/glucose deprivation exposure, an in vitro model of ischemia. SHSY5Y cells treated with quercetin also increased the expression of Nrf2 (via a decrease in the levels of Keap1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and nitric oxide synthase 1 (NOS1), which provide further protection from oxidative stress. In addition, the increased SUMOylation of HIF-1α was noted and deemed to be significant. We hypothesize that SUMOylated HIF-1α plays a fundamental role in the protection afforded and may underlie some of quercetin's ability to protect cells from oxygen/glucose deprivation-induced cell death, via an up-regulation of HO-1 and NOS1, which ultimately leads to the induction of pro-life NOS1/protein kinase G signaling. Quercetin acts to increase survival in the face of ischemia via an increase of SENP3 expression, the possible inactivation of SENPs 1/2, and via a decrease in KEAP1 levels (thereby increasing Nrf2 stability). These changes may then lead to increase in HIF-1α SUMOylation and HO-1 activation, followed by an up-regulation of NOS1/PKG signaling. Pathways altered via quercetin treatment within our experimental system are represented by blue arrowheads. Solid black arrows represent relationships that have been explored while a dotted arrow represents a relationship that has yet to be confirmed.

"Longitudinal sampling for intestinal microbiota in wild animals is difficult, leading to a lack of information on bacterial dynamics occurring in nature. We studied how the composition of microbiota communities changed temporally in free-ranging small primates, rufous mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus). We marked and recaptured mouse lemurs during their mating season in Ranomafana National Park in southeastern mountainous rainforests of Madagascar for 2 years and determined the fecal microbiota compositions of these mouse lemurs with MiSeq sequencing. We collected 160 fecal samples from 71 animals and had two or more samples from 39 individuals. We found small, but statistically significant, effects of site and age on microbiota richness and diversity and effects of sex, year, and site on microbiota composition, while the within-year temporal trends were less clear. Within-host microbiota showed pervasive variation in intestinal bacterial community composition, especially during the second study year. We hypothesize that the biological properties of mouse lemurs, including their small body size and fast metabolism, may contribute to the temporal intraindividual-level variation, something that should be testable with more-extensive sampling regimes. IMPORTANCE: While microbiome research has blossomed in recent years, there is a lack of longitudinal studies on microbiome dynamics on free-ranging hosts. To fill this gap, we followed mouse lemurs, which are small heterothermic primates, for 2 years. Most studied animals have shown microbiota to be stable over the life span of host individuals, but some previous research also found ample within-host variation in microbiota composition. Our study used a larger sample size than previous studies and a study setting well suited to track within-host variation in free-ranging mammals. Despite the overall microbiota stability at the population level, the microbiota of individual mouse lemurs can show large-scale changes in composition in time periods as short as 2 days, suggesting caution in inferring individual-level patterns from population-level data.

"Mammalian hibernators adapt to prolonged periods of immobility, hypometabolism, hypothermia, and oxidative stress, each capable of reducing bone marrow activity. In this study bone marrow transcriptomes were compared among thirteen-lined ground squirrels collected in July, winter torpor, and winter interbout arousal (IBA). The results were consistent with a suppression of acquired immune responses, and a shift to innate immune responses during hibernation through higher complement expression. Consistent with the increase in adipocytes found in bone marrow of hibernators, expression of genes associated with white adipose tissue are higher during hibernation. Genes that should strengthen the bone by increasing extracellular matrix were higher during hibernation, especially the collagen genes. Finally, expression of heat shock proteins were lower, and cold-response genes were higher, during hibernation. No differential expression of hematopoietic genes involved in erythrocyte or megakaryocyte production was observed. This global view of the changes in the bone marrow transcriptome over both short term (torpor vs. IBA) and long term (torpor vs. July) hypothermia can explain several observations made about circulating blood cells and the structure and strength of the bone during hibernation.

"When faced with adverse environmental conditions, the marsupial Dromiciops gliroides uses either daily or seasonal torpor to support survival and is the only known hibernating mammal in South America. As the sole living representative of the ancient Order Microbiotheria, this species can provide crucial information about the evolutionary origins and biochemical mechanisms of hibernation. Hibernation is a complex energy-saving strategy that involves changes in gene expression that are elicited in part by microRNAs. To better elucidate the role of microRNAs in orchestrating hypometabolism, a modified stem-loop technique and quantitative PCR were used to characterize the relative expression levels of 85 microRNAs in liver and skeletal muscle of control and torpid D. gliroides. Thirty-nine microRNAs were differentially regulated during torpor; of these, 35 were downregulated in liver and 11 were differentially expressed in skeletal muscle. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that the downregulated liver microRNAs were associated with activation of MAPK, PI3K-Akt and mTOR pathways, suggesting their importance in facilitating marsupial torpor. In skeletal muscle, hibernation-responsive microRNAs were predicted to regulate focal adhesion, ErbB, and mTOR pathways, indicating a promotion of muscle maintenance mechanisms. These tissue-specific responses suggest that microRNAs regulate key molecular pathways that facilitate hibernation, thermoregulation, and prevention of muscle disuse atrophy.

"Vertebrate genomes contain many virus-related sequences derived from both retroviruses and non-retroviral RNA and DNA viruses. Such non-retroviral RNA sequences are possibly produced by reverse-transcription and integration of viral mRNAs of ancient RNA viruses using retrotransposon machineries. We refer to this process as transcript reversion. During an ancient bornavirus infection, transcript reversion may have left bornavirus-related sequences, known as endogenous bornavirus-like nucleoproteins (EBLNs), in the genome. We have recently demonstrated that all Homo sapiens EBLNs are expressed in at least one tissue. Because species with EBLNs appear relatively protected against infection by a current bornavirus, Borna disease virus, it is speculated that EBLNs play some roles in antiviral immunity, as seen with some endogenous retroviruses. EBLNs can function as dominant negative forms of viral proteins, small RNAs targeting viral sequences, or DNA or RNA elements modulating the gene expression. Growing evidence reveals that various RNA viruses are reverse-transcribed and integrated into the genome of infected cells, suggesting transcript reversion generally occurs during ongoing infection. Considering this, transcript reversion-mediated interference with related viruses may be a novel type of antiviral immunity in vertebrates. Understanding the biological significance of transcript reversion will provide novel insights into host defenses against viral infections.

"The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective effects of diallyl trisulfide (DATS) against naphthalene-induced oxidative and inflammatory damage in the livers and lungs of mice. Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels showed significant hepatic damage after the challenge with 100 mg/kg naphthalene. Hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) contents and the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) increased significantly, accompanying a decrease in the hepatic activity of total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) levels after the naphthalene damage. In addition, the serum levels of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and interleukin 8 (IL-8) increased significantly in the groups damaged with naphthalene. The main parameters related to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the lungs, including the NO, MPO, and GSH contents, were determined, and the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in the lung and liver tissues were also observed. In the DATS-treated groups, all of the oxidative and inflammatory damage in the serum, liver, and lung tissues were significantly prevented.

"Ground squirrels are an increasingly important model for studying visual processing, retinal circuitry, and cone photoreceptor function. Here, we demonstrate that the photoreceptor mosaic can be longitudinally imaged noninvasively in the 13-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) using confocal and nonconfocal split-detection adaptive optics scanning ophthalmoscopy using 790 nm light. Photoreceptor density, spacing, and Voronoi analysis are consistent with that of the human cone mosaic. The high imaging success rate and consistent image quality in this study reinforce the ground squirrel as a practical model to aid drug discovery and testing through longitudinal imaging on the cellular scale.

"Although evidence indicates that drug target genes share some common evolutionary features, there have been few studies analyzing evolutionary features of drug targets from an overall level. Therefore, we conducted an analysis which aimed to investigate the evolutionary characteristics of drug target genes. We compared the evolutionary conservation between human drug target genes and non-target genes by combining both the evolutionary features and network topological properties in human protein-protein interaction network. The evolution rate, conservation score and the percentage of orthologous genes of 21 species were included in our study. Meanwhile, four topological features including the average shortest path length, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient and degree were considered for comparison analysis. Then we got four results as following: compared with non-drug target genes, 1) drug target genes had lower evolutionary rates; 2) drug target genes had higher conservation scores; 3) drug target genes had higher percentages of orthologous genes and 4) drug target genes had a tighter network structure including higher degrees, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficients and lower average shortest path lengths. These results demonstrate that drug target genes are more evolutionarily conserved than non-drug target genes. We hope that our study will provide valuable information for other researchers who are interested in evolutionary conservation of drug targets.

"Hibernation is one type of torpor, a hypometabolic state in heterothermic mammals, which can be used as an energy-conservation strategy in response to harsh environments, e.g. limited food resource. The liver, in particular, plays a crucial role in adaptive metabolic adjustment during hibernation. Studies on ground squirrels and bears reveal that many genes involved in metabolism are differentially expressed during hibernation. Especially, the genes involved in carbohydrate catabolism are down-regulated during hibernation, while genes responsible for lipid β-oxidation are up-regulated. However, there is little transcriptional evidence to suggest physiological changes to the liver during hibernation in the greater horseshoe bat, a representative heterothermic bat. In this study, we explored the transcriptional changes in the livers of active and torpid greater horseshoe bats using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 1358 genes were identified as differentially expressed during torpor. In the functional analyses, differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in metabolic depression, shifts in the fuel utilization, immune function and response to stresses. Our findings provide a comprehensive evidence of differential gene expression in the livers of greater horseshoe bats during active and torpid states and highlight potential evidence for physiological adaptations that occur in the liver during hibernation.

"Viruses impose diverse and dynamic challenges on host defenses. Diversifying selection of codons and gene copy number variation are two hallmarks of genetic innovation in antiviral genes engaged in host-virus genetic conflicts. The myxovirus resistance (Mx) genes encode interferon-inducible GTPases that constitute a major arm of the cell-autonomous defense against viral infection. Unlike the broad antiviral activity of MxA, primate MxB was recently shown to specifically inhibit lentiviruses including HIV-1. We carried out detailed evolutionary analyses to investigate whether genetic conflict with lentiviruses has shaped MxB evolution in primates. We found strong evidence for diversifying selection in the MxB N-terminal tail, which contains molecular determinants of MxB anti-lentivirus specificity. However, we found no overlap between previously-mapped residues that dictate lentiviral restriction and those that have evolved under diversifying selection. Instead, our findings are consistent with MxB having a long-standing and important role in the interferon response to viral infection against a broader range of pathogens than is currently appreciated. Despite its critical role in host innate immunity, we also uncovered multiple functional losses of MxB during mammalian evolution, either by pseudogenization or by gene conversion from MxA genes. Thus, although the majority of mammalian genomes encode two Mx genes, this apparent stasis masks the dramatic effects that recombination and diversifying selection have played in shaping the evolutionary history of Mx genes. Discrepancies between our study and previous publications highlight the need to account for recombination in analyses of positive selection, as well as the importance of using sequence datasets with appropriate depth of divergence. Our study also illustrates that evolutionary analyses of antiviral gene families are critical towards understanding molecular principles that govern host-virus interactions and species-specific susceptibility to viral infection.

"Where in genes do pathogenic mutations tend to occur and does this provide clues as to the possible underlying mechanisms by which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) cause disease? As splice-disrupting mutations tend to occur predominantly at exon ends, known also to be hot spots of cis-exonic splice control elements, we examine the relationship between the relative density of such exonic cis-motifs and pathogenic SNPs. In particular, we focus on the intragene distribution of exonic splicing enhancers (ESE) and the covariance between them and disease-associated SNPs. In addition to showing that disease-causing genes tend to be genes with a high intron density, consistent with missplicing, five factors established as trends in ESE usage, are considered: relative position in exons, relative position in genes, flanking intron size, splice sites usage, and phase. We find that more than 76% of pathogenic SNPs are within 3-69 bp of exon ends where ESEs generally reside, this being 13% more than expected. Overall from enrichment of pathogenic SNPs at exon ends, we estimate that approximately 20-45% of SNPs affect splicing. Importantly, we find that within genes pathogenic SNPs tend to occur in splicing-relevant regions with low ESE density: they are found to occur preferentially in the terminal half of genes, in exons flanked by short introns and at the ends of phase (0,0) exons with 3' non-""AGgt"" splice site. We suggest the concept of the ""fragile"" exon, one home to pathogenic SNPs owing to its vulnerability to splice disruption owing to low ESE density.

"Endogenous bornavirus-like nucleoprotein elements (EBLNs) are sequences within vertebrate genomes derived from reverse transcription and integration of ancient bornaviral nucleoprotein mRNA via the host retrotransposon machinery. While species with EBLNs appear relatively resistant to bornaviral disease, the nature of this association is unclear. We hypothesized that EBLNs could give rise to antiviral interfering RNA in the form of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), a class of small RNA known to silence transposons but not exogenous viruses. We found that in both rodents and primates, which acquired their EBLNs independently some 25-40 million years ago, EBLNs are present within piRNA-generating regions of the genome far more often than expected by chance alone (ℙ = 8 × 10(-3)-6 × 10(-8)). Three of the seven human EBLNs fall within annotated piRNA clusters and two marmoset EBLNs give rise to bona fide piRNAs. In both rats and mice, at least two of the five EBLNs give rise to abundant piRNAs in the male gonad. While no EBLNs are syntenic between rodent and primate, some of the piRNA clusters containing EBLNs are; thus we deduce that EBLNs were integrated into existing piRNA clusters. All true piRNAs derived from EBLNs are antisense relative to the proposed ancient bornaviral nucleoprotein mRNA. These observations are consistent with a role for EBLN-derived piRNA-like RNAs in interfering with ancient bornaviral infection. They raise the hypothesis that retrotransposon-dependent virus-to-host gene flow could engender RNA-mediated, sequence-specific antiviral immune memory in metazoans analogous to the CRISPR/Cas system in prokaryotes.

"The brain of mammalian hibernators is naturally protected. Hibernating ground squirrels undergo rapid and extreme changes in body temperature and brain perfusion as they cycle between lengthy torpor bouts and brief periods of euthermia called interbout arousals (IBAs). Arousal from torpor to IBA occurs rapidly, but there is no evidence of brain injury accompanying this extreme physiological transition. Production of the hormone melatonin accompanies arousal, suggesting that it plays a protective role at this time. Here, we investigated mechanisms of melatonin receptor-mediated protection in the brain of the hibernating ground squirrel. We administered the competitive melatonin receptor antagonist luzindole (30 mg/kg ip) to ground squirrels at the predicted end of a torpor bout, triggering an arousal. We found that luzindole-treated animals exhibited caspase-3 activity two times higher than vehicle-treated animals in the hypothalamus at midarousal (P = 0.01), suggesting that melatonin receptor signaling is important for protection in this brain region. We also found a 30% decline in succinate-fueled mitochondrial respiration in luzindole-treated animals compared with vehicle-treated animals (P = 0.019), suggesting that melatonin receptor signaling is important for optimal mitochondrial function during arousal from torpor. The mitochondrial effects of luzindole treatment were seen only during the hibernation season, indicating that this effect is specifically important for arousal from torpor. These data provide evidence for the protective role of melatonin receptor signaling during the extreme physiological transition that occurs when a hibernating mammal arouses from torpor and provide further evidence for regional and seasonal changes in the hibernator brain.

"Identification of epitopes for integrin-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has aided our understanding of structure-function relationship of integrins. We mapped epitopes of chicken anti-integrin-α8-subunit-blocking mAbs by mutational analyses, examining regions that harboured all mapped epitopes recognized by mAbs against other α-subunits in the RGD-binding-integrin subfamily. Six mAbs exhibited blocking function, and these mAbs recognized residues on the same W2:41-loop on the top-face of the β-propeller. Loop-tips sufficiently close to W2:41 (<25 Å) contained within a footprint of the mAbs were mutated, and the loop W3:34 on the bottom face was identified as an additional component of the epitope of one antibody, clone YZ5. Binding sequences on the two loops were conserved in virtually all mammals, and that on W3:34 was also conserved in chickens. These indicate 1) YZ5 binds both top and bottom loops, and the binding to W3:34 is by interactions to conserved residues between immunogen and host species, 2) five other blocking mAbs solely bind to W2:41 and 3) the α8 mAbs would cross-react with most mammals. Comparing with the mAbs against the other α-subunits of RGD-integrins, two classes were delineated; those binding to ""W3:34 and an top-loop"", and ""solely W2:41"", accounting for 82% of published RGD-integrin-mAbs.

"The rapid expansion of next-generation sequencing has yielded a powerful array of tools to address fundamental biological questions at a scale that was inconceivable just a few years ago. Various genome-partitioning strategies to sequence select subsets of the genome have emerged as powerful alternatives to whole-genome sequencing in ecological and evolutionary genomic studies. High-throughput targeted capture is one such strategy that involves the parallel enrichment of preselected genomic regions of interest. The growing use of targeted capture demonstrates its potential power to address a range of research questions, yet these approaches have yet to expand broadly across laboratories focused on evolutionary and ecological genomics. In part, the use of targeted capture has been hindered by the logistics of capture design and implementation in species without established reference genomes. Here we aim to (i) increase the accessibility of targeted capture to researchers working in nonmodel taxa by discussing capture methods that circumvent the need of a reference genome, (ii) highlight the evolutionary and ecological applications where this approach is emerging as a powerful sequencing strategy and (iii) discuss the future of targeted capture and other genome-partitioning approaches in the light of the increasing accessibility of whole-genome sequencing. Given the practical advantages and increasing feasibility of high-throughput targeted capture, we anticipate an ongoing expansion of capture-based approaches in evolutionary and ecological research, synergistic with an expansion of whole-genome sequencing.

"Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is the etiological agent of human (MPX). It is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weight-loss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1(-/-) mice against mortality and morbidity. This work demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and the use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform.

"BACKGROUND: Hibernation is a survival mechanism in the winter for some animals. Fat preserved instead of glucose produced is the primary fuel during winter hibernation of mammals. Many genes involved in lipid metabolism are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). The role of PPARα in hibernation of mammals remains largely unknown. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we investigated whether PPARα is adapted to hibernation in bats. RESULTS: Evolutionary analyses revealed that the ω value of Pparα of the ancestral lineage of hibernating bats in both Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera was lower than that of non-hibernating bats in Yinpterochiroptera, suggesting that a higher selective pressure acts on Pparα in hibernating bats. PPARα expression was found to be increased at both mRNA and protein levels in distantly related bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum and Hipposideros armiger in Yinpterochiroptera and Myotis ricketti in Yangochiroptera) during their torpid episodes. Transcription factors such as FOXL1, NFYA, NFYB, SP1, TBP, and ERG were bioinformatically determined to have a higher binding affinity to the potential regulatory regions of Pparα in hibernating than in non-hibernating mammals. Genome-wide bioinformatic analyses of 64 mammalian species showed that PPARα has more potential target genes and higher binding affinity to these genes in hibernating than in non-hibernating mammals. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PPARα is adapted to hibernation in bats based on the observations that Pparα has a more stringent functional constraint in the ancestral lineage of hibernating bats and a higher level of expression in hibernating than in non-hibernating bats. We also conclude that PPARα plays a very important role in hibernation as hibernators have more PPARα target genes than non-hibernators, and PPARα in hibernators has a higher binding affinity for its target genes than in non-hibernators.

"APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3) proteins are cellular DNA deaminases that restrict a broad spectrum of lentiviruses. This process is counteracted by Vif (viral infectivity factor) of lentiviruses, which binds APOBEC3s and promotes their degradation. CBF-β (core binding factor subunit β) is an essential co-factor for the function of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif to degrade human APOBEC3s. However, the requirement for CBF-β in Vif-mediated degradation of other mammalian APOBEC3 proteins is less clear. Here, we determined the sequence of feline CBFB and performed phylogenetic analyses. These analyses revealed that mammalian CBFB is under purifying selection. Moreover, we demonstrated that CBF-β is dispensable for feline immunodeficiency virus Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3s of its host. These findings suggested that primate lentiviruses have adapted to use CBF-β, an evolutionary stable protein, to counteract APOBEC3 proteins of their hosts after diverging from other lentiviruses.

"Most circulating human gamma delta T cells are Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Their hallmark is the expression of T cell antigen receptors (TCR) whose γ-chains show a Vγ9-JP (Vγ2-Jγ1.2) rearrangement and are paired with Vδ2-containing δ-chains, a dominant TCR configuration, which until recently seemed to occur in primates only. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells respond to phosphoantigens (PAg) such as (E)-4-Hydroxy-3-methyl-but-2-enyl pyrophosphate (HMBPP), which is produced by many pathogens and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), which accumulates in certain tumors or cells treated with aminobisphosphonates such as zoledronate. A prerequisite for PAg-induced activation is the contact of Vγ9Vδ2 T cells with cells expressing butyrophilin-3 A1 (BTN3A1). We will first critically review models of how BTN3 might act in PAg-mediated Vγ9Vδ2 T cell activation and then address putative co-evolution of Vγ9, Vδ2, and BTN3 genes. In those rodent and lagomorphs used as animal models, all three genes are lost but a data-base analysis showed that they emerged together with placental mammals. A strong concomitant conservation of functional Vγ9, Vδ2, and BTN3 genes in other species suggests co-evolution of these three genes. A detailed analysis was performed for the new world camelid alpaca (Vicugna pacos). It provides an excellent candidate for a non-primate species with presumably functional Vγ9Vδ2 T cells since TCR rearrangements share features characteristic for PAg-reactive primate Vγ9Vδ2 TCR and proposed PAg-binding sites of BTN3A1 have been conserved. Finally, we analyze the possible functional relationship between the butyrophilin-family member Skint1 and the γδ TCR-V genes used by murine dendritic epithelial T cells (DETC). Among placental mammals, we identify five rodents, the cow, a bat, and the cape golden mole as the only species concomitantly possessing potentially functional homologs of murine Vγ3, Vδ4 genes, and Skint1 gene and suggest to search for DETC like cells in these species.

"Protocols for characterizing cellular phenotypes commonly use chemical fixatives to preserve anatomical features, mechanically stabilize tissue, and stop physiological responses. Formaldehyde, diluted in either phosphate-buffered saline or phosphate buffer, has been widely used in studies of neurons, especially in conjunction with dyes and antibodies. However, previous studies have found that these fixatives induce the formation of bead-like varicosities in the dendrites and axons of brain and spinal cord neurons. We report here that these formaldehyde formulations can induce bead formation in the dendrites and axons of adult rat and rabbit retinal ganglion cells, and that retinal ganglion cells differ from hippocampal, cortical, cerebellar, and spinal cord neurons in that bead formation is not blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists, a voltage-gated Na(+) channel toxin, extracellular Ca(2+) ion exclusion, or temperature shifts. Moreover, we describe a modification of formaldehyde-based fixatives that prevents bead formation in retinal ganglion cells visualized by green fluorescent protein expression and by immunohistochemistry.

"Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from the skeletal muscle of euthermic and torpid Ictidomys tridecemlineatus was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity using a novel method involving Blue-agarose and Phenyl-agarose chromatography. Kinetic analysis of the enzymes isolated from the two conditions suggested the existence of two structurally distinct proteins, with GAPDH V max being 40-60% less for the enzyme from the torpid condition (in both glycolytic and gluconeogenic directions) as compared to the euthermic enzyme form. Thermal denaturation, in part determined by differential scanning fluorimetry, revealed that purified GAPDH from the torpid animals was significantly more stable that the enzyme from the euthermic condition. Mass spectrometry combined with Western blot analyses of purified GAPDH indicate that the cellular GAPDH population is extensively modified, with posttranslational phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation being detected. Global reduction in GAPDH tyrosine phosphorylation during torpor as well as site specific alterations in methylation sites suggests that that the stable changes observed in kinetic and structural GAPDH properties may be due to posttranslational modification of this enzyme during torpor. Taken together, these results suggest a stable suppression of GAPDH (possibly by some reversible posttranslational modification) during ground squirrel torpor, which likely contributes to the overall reduction in carbohydrate metabolism when these animals switch to lipid fuels during dormancy.

"Although much is known about the physiological responses of many environmental stresses in tolerant animals, studies evaluating the regulation of stress-induced mechanisms that regulate the transitions to and from this state are beginning to explore new and fascinating areas of molecular research. Current findings have developed a general, but refined, view of the important molecular pathways contributing to stress-survival. However, studies utilizing newly developed technologies that broadly focus on genomic and proteomic screening are beginning to identify many new targets for future study. This minireview will provide a contextual overview on the use of DNA/RNA sequencing, microRNA annotation and prediction software, protein structure and function prediction tools, as well as methods of high-throughput protein expression analysis. We will also use select examples to highlight the existing use of these technologies in stress biology research. Such tools can be used in comparative stress biology in the characterization of animal responses to environmental challenges. Although there are many areas of study left to be explored, research in comparative stress biology will always be continuing as new technologies allow the further analysis of cell function, and new paradigms in gene regulation and regulatory molecules (such as microRNAs) are continuing to be discovered. Building upon the findings of past research, while utilizing new technologies in the appropriate manner, future studies can be carried out in new and exciting areas still unexplored. Proper use of rapidly developing technologies will help to create a complete understanding of the animal stress response and survival mechanisms utilized by many diverse organisms.

"Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis in breast cancer. With the availability of therapeutic antibodies against HER2, great strides have been made in the clinical management of HER2 overexpressing breast cancer. However, de novo and acquired resistance to these antibodies presents a serious limitation to successful HER2 targeting treatment. The identification of novel epitopes of HER2 that can be used for functional/region-specific blockade could represent a central step in the development of new clinically relevant anti-HER2 antibodies. In the present study, we present a novel computational approach as an auxiliary tool for identification of novel HER2 epitopes. We hypothesized that the structurally and linearly evolutionarily conserved motifs of the extracellular domain of HER2 (ECD HER2) contain potential druggable epitopes/targets. We employed the PROSITE Scan to detect structurally conserved motifs and PRINTS to search for linearly conserved motifs of ECD HER2. We found that the epitopes recognized by trastuzumab and pertuzumab are located in the predicted conserved motifs of ECD HER2, supporting our initial hypothesis. Considering that structurally and linearly conserved motifs can provide functional specific configurations, we propose that by comparing the two types of conserved motifs, additional druggable epitopes/targets in the ECD HER2 protein can be identified, which can be further modified for potential therapeutic application. Thus, this novel computational process for predicting or searching for potential epitopes or key target sites may contribute to epitope-based vaccine and function-selected drug design, especially when x-ray crystal structure protein data is not available.

"Heat shock protein (Hsp) genes are stress-related genes that activate the host immune system during infection. Hsp genes expression in fish, studied during bacterial infections, is mostly confined to Hsp70 and Hsp90. The present study is an expression analysis of seven Hsp genes: Apg2, Hsp90, Hsp70, glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78), heat shock cognate 70 (Hsc70), Grp75, and Hsp30 during Aeromonas hydrophila infection in rohu, Labeo rohita. Forty-eight rohu juveniles were challenged with 3 × 10(7) cfu bacteria per 20 g of body weight intraperitoneally. The expression of these genes was studied in infected liver, anterior kidney, and spleen tissues of rohu at different time periods: 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 h, 7, and 15 days post-infection by qPCR. The Hsp gene modulation was greater in liver as compared to spleen and kidney tissues. Induced expression of Apg2, Hsp90, Grp78, Grp75, and Hsc70 was noticed during peak periods (3 to 24 h post-challenge) of bacterial infectivity. Hsp70 was found to be down-regulated during the process of infection. In contrast to the other six genes, Hsp30 showed a variable expression pattern in all three tissues. Grp78 was found to be the most highly (1,587-fold) expressed gene in liver at 12 h post-challenge. Further, molecular characterization of Grp78 revealed it to be a highly conserved Hsp gene, essential not only during infection but also during early developmental stages of rohu, and its expression was noticed in all organs studied except in gill tissues, which indicated its potential immune regulatory role during infection process.

"β-Arrestins are signaling adaptors that bind to agonist-occupied G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and target them for endocytosis; however, the mechanisms regulating receptor/β-arrestin complexes and trafficking in endosomes, remain ill defined. Here we show, in live cells, differential dynamic regulation of endosomal bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R) complexes with either β-arrestin-1 or -2. We find a novel role for MAPK in the B2R/β-arrestin-2 complex formation, receptor trafficking and signaling mediated by an ERK1/2 regulatory motif in the hinge domain of the rat β-arrestin-2 (PET(178)P), but not rat β-arrestin-1 (PER(177)P). While the ERK1/2 regulatory motif is conserved between rat and mouse β-arrestin-2, it is surprisingly not conserved in human β-arrestin-2 (PEK(178)P). However, mutation of lysine 178 to threonine is sufficient to confer MAPK sensitivity to the human β-arrestin-2. Furthermore, substitution for a phosphomimetic residue in both the rat and the human β-arrestin-2 (T/K178D) significantly stabilizes B2R/β-arrestin complexes in endosomes, delays receptor recycling to the plasma membrane and maintains intracellular MAPK signaling. Similarly, the endosomal trafficking of β2-adrenergic, angiotensin II type 1 and vasopressin V2 receptors was altered by the β-arrestin-2 T178D mutant. Our findings unveil a novel subtype specific mode of MAPK-dependent regulation of β-arrestins in intracellular trafficking and signaling of GPCRs, and suggest differential endosomal receptor/β-arrestin-2 signaling roles among species.

"Mammalian hibernators undergo profound behavioral, physiological, and biochemical changes in order to cope with hypothermia, ischemia-reperfusion, and finite fuel reserves over days or weeks of continuous torpor. Against a backdrop of global reductions in energy-expensive processes such as transcription and translation, a subset of genes/proteins are strategically upregulated in order to meet challenges associated with hibernation. Consequently, hibernation involves substantial transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms and provides a phenomenon with which to understand how a set of common genes/proteins can be differentially regulated in order to enhance stress tolerance beyond that which is possible for nonhibernators. The present review focuses on the involvement of messenger RNA (mRNA) interacting factors that play a role in the regulation of gene/protein expression programs that define the hibernating phenotype. These include proteins involved in mRNA processing (i.e., capping, splicing, and polyadenylation) and the possible role of alternative splicing as a means of enhancing protein diversity. Since the total pool of mRNA remains constant throughout torpor, mechanisms which enhance mRNA stability are discussed in the context of RNA binding proteins and mRNA decay pathways. Furthermore, mechanisms which control the global reduction of cap-dependent translation and the involvement of internal ribosome entry sites in mRNAs encoding stress response proteins are also discussed. Finally, the concept of regulating each of these factors in discrete subcellular compartments for enhanced efficiency is addressed. The analysis draws on recent research from several well-studied mammalian hibernators including ground squirrels, bats, and bears.

"In all of the mammalian species studied to date, the short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cones and the S-cone bipolar cells that receive their input are very similar, but the retinal ganglion cells that receive synapses from the S-cone bipolar cells appear to be quite different. Here, we review the literature on mammalian retinal ganglion cells that respond selectively to stimulation of S-cones and respond with opposite polarity to longer wavelength stimuli. There are at least three basic mechanisms to generate these color-opponent responses, including: (1) opponency is generated in the outer plexiform layer by horizontal cells and is conveyed to the ganglion cells via S-cone bipolar cells, (2) inputs from bipolar cells with different cone inputs and opposite response polarity converge directly on the ganglion cells, and (3) inputs from S-cone bipolar cells are inverted by S-cone amacrine cells. These are not mutually exclusive; some mammalian ganglion cells that respond selectively to S-cone stimulation seem to utilize at least two of them. Based on these findings, we suggest that the small bistratified ganglion cells described in primates are not the ancestral type, as proposed previously. Instead, the known types of ganglion cells in this pathway evolved from monostratified ancestral types and became bistratified in some mammalian lineages.

"We used RNAseq to generate a comprehensive transcriptome of Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) over the course of a year in the naturally hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrel, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. During hibernation ground squirrels do not feed and use fat stored in White Adipose Tissue (WAT) as their primary source of fuel. Stored lipid is consumed at high rates by BAT to generate heat at specific points during the hibernation season. The highest rate of BAT activity occurs during periodic arousals from hypothermic torpor bouts, referred to as Interbout Arousals (IBAs). IBAs are characterized by whole body re-warming (from 5 to 37 °C) in 2-3 hours, and provide a unique opportunity to determine the genes responsible for the highly efficient lipid oxidation and heat generation that drives the arousal process. Illumina HighSeq sequencing identified 14,573 distinct BAT mRNAs and quantified their levels at four points: active ground squirrels in April and October, and hibernating animals during both torpor and IBA. Based on significant changes in mRNA levels across the four collection points, 2,083 genes were shown to be differentially expressed. In addition to providing detail on the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, and genes involved in beta-adrenergic and lipolytic pathways, we identified differentially expressed genes encoding various transcription factors and other regulatory proteins which may play critical roles in high efficiency fat catabolism, non-shivering thermogenesis, and transitions into and out of the torpid state.

"Bornaviruses are the only animal RNA viruses that establish a persistent infection in their host cell nucleus. Studies of bornaviruses have provided unique information about viral replication strategies and virus-host interactions. Although bornaviruses do not integrate into the host genome during their replication cycle, we and others have recently reported that there are DNA sequences derived from the mRNAs of ancient bornaviruses in the genomes of vertebrates, including humans, and these have been designated endogenous borna-like (EBL) elements. Therefore, bornaviruses have been interacting with their hosts as driving forces in the evolution of host genomes in a previously unexpected way. Studies of EBL elements have provided new models for virology, evolutionary biology and general cell biology. In this review, we summarize the data on EBL elements including what we have newly identified in eukaryotes genomes, and discuss the biological significance of EBL elements, with a focus on EBL nucleoprotein elements in mammalian genomes. Surprisingly, EBL elements were detected in the genomes of invertebrates, suggesting that the host range of bornaviruses may be much wider than previously thought. We also review our new data on non-retroviral integration of Borna disease virus.

"Chemokines are a large family of small cytokines that are involved in host defence and body homeostasis through recruitment of cells expressing their receptors. Their genes are known to undergo rapid evolution. Therefore, the number and content of chemokine genes can be quite diverse among the different species, making the orthologous relationships often ambiguous even between closely related species. Given that rodents and rabbit are useful experimental models in medicine and drug development, we have deduced the chemokine genes from the genome sequences of several rodent species and rabbit and compared them with those of human and mouse to determine the orthologous relationships. The interspecies differences should be taken into consideration when experimental results from animal models are extrapolated into humans. The chemokine gene lists and their orthologous relationships presented here will be useful for studies using these animal models. Our analysis also enables us to reconstruct possible gene duplication processes that generated the different sets of chemokine genes in these species.

"Some mammals hibernate in response to harsh environments. Although hibernating mammals may metabolize proteins, the nitrogen metabolic pathways commonly activated during hibernation are not fully characterized. In contrast to the hypothesis of amino acid preservation, we found evidence of amino acid metabolism as three of five key enzymes, including phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD), fumarylacetoacetase (FAH), involved in phenylalanine and tyrosine catabolism were co-upregulated during hibernation in two distantly related species of bats, Myotis ricketti and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. In addition, the levels of phenylalanine in the livers of these bats were significantly decreased during hibernation. Because phenylalanine and tyrosine are both glucogenic and ketogenic, these results indicate the role of this catabolic pathway in energy supply. Since any deficiency in the catabolism of these two amino acids can cause accumulations of toxic metabolites, these results also suggest the detoxification role of these enzymes during hibernation. A higher selective constraint on PAH, HPD, and HGD in hibernators than in non-hibernators was observed, and hibernators had more conserved amino acid residues in each of these enzymes than non-hibernators. These conserved amino acid residues are mostly located in positions critical for the structure and activity of the enzymes. Taken together, results of this work provide novel insights in nitrogen metabolism and removal of harmful metabolites during bat hibernation.

"Life is the interplay between structural-functional integrity of biological systems and the influence of the external environment. To understand this interplay, it is useful to examine an animal model that competes with harsh environment. The dromedary camel is the best model that thrives under severe environment with considerable durability. The current proteomic study on dromedary organs explains a number of cellular mysteries providing functional correlates to arid living. Proteome profiling of camel organs suggests a marked increased expression of various cytoskeleton proteins that promote intracellular trafficking and communication. The comparative overexpression of α-actinin of dromedary heart when compared with rat heart suggests an adaptive peculiarity to sustain hemoconcentration-hemodilution episodes associated with alternative drought-rehydration periods. Moreover, increased expression of the small heat shock protein, α B-crystallin facilitates protein folding and cellular regenerative capacity in dromedary heart. The observed unbalanced expression of different energy related dependent mitochondrial enzymes suggests the possibility of mitochondrial uncoupling in the heart in this species. The evidence of increased expression of H+-ATPase subunit in camel brain guarantees a rapidly usable energy supply. Interestingly, the guanidinoacetate methyltransferase in camel liver has a renovation effect on high energy phosphate with possible concomitant intercession of ion homeostasis. Surprisingly, both hump fat tissue and kidney proteomes share the altered physical distribution of proteins that favor cellular acidosis. Furthermore, the study suggests a vibrant nature for adipose tissue of camel hump by the up-regulation of vimentin in adipocytes, augmenting lipoprotein translocation, blood glucose trapping, and challenging external physical extra-stress. The results obtained provide new evidence of homeostasis in the arid habitat suitable for this mammal.

"In the context of normal cell turnover, apoptosis is a natural phenomenon involved in making essential life and death decisions. Apoptotic pathways balance signals which promote cell death (pro-apoptotic pathways) or counteract these signals (anti-apoptotic pathways). We proposed that changes in anti-apoptotic proteins would occur during mammalian hibernation to aid cell preservation during prolonged torpor under cellular conditions that are highly injurious to most mammals (e.g. low body temperatures, ischemia). Immunoblotting was used to analyze the expression of proteins associated with pro-survival in six tissues of thirteen-lined ground squirrels, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. The brain showed a concerted response to torpor with significant increases in the levels of all anti-apoptotic targets analyzed (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, BI-1, Mcl-1, cIAP1/2, xIAP) as well as enhanced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at S70 and T56. Heart responded similarly with most anti-apoptotic proteins elevated significantly during torpor except for Bcl-xL and xIAP that decreased and Mcl-1 that was unaltered. In liver, BI-1 increased whereas cIAP1/2 decreased. In kidney, there was an increase in BI-1, cIAP and xIAP but decreases in Bcl-xL and p-Bcl-2(T56) content. In brown adipose tissue, protein levels of BI-1, cIAP1/2, and xIAP decreased significantly during torpor (compared with euthermia) whereas Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 were unaltered; however, Bcl-2 showed enhanced phosphorylation at Thr56 but not at Ser70. In skeletal muscle, only xIAP levels changed significantly during torpor (an increase). The data show that anti-apoptotic pathways have organ-specific responses in hibernators with a prominent potential role in heart and brain where coordinated enhancement of anti-apoptotic proteins occurred in response to torpor.

"Monkeypox virus (MPXV) was discovered in 1958 during an outbreak in an animal facility in Copenhagen, Denmark. Since its discovery, MPXV has revealed a propensity to infect and induce disease in a large number of animals within the mammalia class from pan-geographical locations. This finding has impeded the elucidation of the natural host, although the strongest candidates are African squirrels and/or other rodents. Experimentally, MPXV can infect animals via a variety of multiple different inoculation routes; however, the natural route of transmission is unknown and is likely to be somewhat species specific. In this review we have attempted to compile and discuss all published articles that describe experimental or natural infections with MPXV, dating from the initial discovery of the virus through to the year 2012. We further discuss the comparative disease courses and pathologies of the host species.

"TRIM5 is a host antiviral gene with an evolutionary history of genetic conflict with retroviruses. The TRIMCyp gene encodes a protein fusion of TRIM5 effector domains with the capsid-binding ability of a retrotransposed CyclophilinA (CypA), resulting in novel antiviral specificity against lentiviruses. Previous studies have identified two independent primate TRIMCyp fusions that evolved within the past 6 My. Here, we describe an ancient primate TRIMCyp gene (that we call TRIMCypA3), which evolved in the common ancestor of simian primates 43 Mya. Gene reconstruction shows that CypA3 encoded an intact, likely active, TRIMCyp antiviral gene, which was subject to selective constraints for at least 10 My, followed by pseudogenization or loss in all extant primates. Despite its decayed status, we found TRIMCypA3 gene fusion transcripts in several primates. We found that the reconstructed ""newly born"" TrimCypA3 encoded robust and broad retroviral restriction activity but that this broad activity was lost via eight amino acid changes over the course of the next 10 My. We propose that TRIMCypA3 arose in response to a viral pathogen encountered by ancestral primates but was subsequently pseudogenized or lost due to a lack of selective pressure. Much like imprints of ancient viruses, fossils of decayed genes, such as TRIMCypA3, provide unique and specific insight into paleoviral infections that plagued primates deep in their evolutionary history.

"Hibernation is a natural adaptation that allows certain mammals to survive physiological extremes that are lethal to humans. Near freezing body temperatures, heart rates of 3-10 beats per minute, absence of food consumption, and depressed metabolism are characteristic of hibernation torpor bouts that are periodically interrupted by brief interbout arousals (IBAs). The molecular basis of torpor induction is unknown, however starved mice overexpressing the metabolic hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) promote fat utilization, reduce body temperature, and readily enter torpor-all hallmarks of mammalian hibernation. In this study we cloned FGF21 from the naturally hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) and found that levels of FGF21 mRNA in liver and FGF21 protein in serum are elevated during hibernation torpor bouts and significantly elevated during IBAs compared to summer active animals. The effects of artificially elevating circulating FGF21 concentrations 50 to 100-fold via adenoviral-mediated overexpression were examined at three different times of the year. This is the first time that a transgenic approach has been used in a natural hibernator to examine mechanistic aspects of hibernation. Surgically implanted transmitters measured various metrics of the hibernation phenotype over a 7-day period including changes in motor activity, heart rate and core body temperature. In April fed-state animals, FGF21 overexpression decreased blood insulin and free fatty acid concentrations, effects similar to those seen in obese mice. However, elevated FGF21 concentrations did not cause torpor in these fed-state animals nor did they cause torpor or affect metabolic parameters in fasted-state animals in March/April, August or October. We conclude that FGF21 is strongly regulated during torpor and IBA but that its overexpression is not sufficient to cause torpor in naturally hibernating ground squirrels.

"In addition to the strong divergent evolution and significant and episodic evolutionary transitions and speciation we previously attributed to TE-Thrust, we have expanded the hypothesis to more fully account for the contribution of viruses to TE-Thrust and evolution. The concept of symbiosis and holobiontic genomes is acknowledged, with particular emphasis placed on the creativity potential of the union of retroviral genomes with vertebrate genomes. Further expansions of the TE-Thrust hypothesis are proposed regarding a fuller account of horizontal transfer of TEs, the life cycle of TEs, and also, in the case of a mammalian innovation, the contributions of retroviruses to the functions of the placenta. The possibility of drift by TE families within isolated demes or disjunct populations, is acknowledged, and in addition, we suggest the possibility of horizontal transposon transfer into such subpopulations. ""Adaptive potential"" and ""evolutionary potential"" are proposed as the extremes of a continuum of ""intra-genomic potential"" due to TE-Thrust. Specific data is given, indicating ""adaptive potential"" being realized with regard to insecticide resistance, and other insect adaptations. In this regard, there is agreement between TE-Thrust and the concept of adaptation by a change in allele frequencies. Evidence on the realization of ""evolutionary potential"" is also presented, which is compatible with the known differential survivals, and radiations of lineages. Collectively, these data further suggest the possibility, or likelihood, of punctuated episodes of speciation events and evolutionary transitions, coinciding with, and heavily underpinned by, intermittent bursts of TE activity.

"Muscle wasting is common in mammals during extended periods of immobility. However, many small hibernating mammals manage to avoid muscle atrophy despite remaining stationary for long periods during hibernation. Recent research has highlighted roles for short non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) in the regulation of stress tolerance. We proposed that they could also play an important role in muscle maintenance during hibernation. To explore this possibility, a group of 10 miRNAs known to be normally expressed in skeletal muscle of non-hibernating mammals were analyzed by RT-PCR in hibernating little brown bats, Myotis lucifugus. We then compared the expression of these miRNAs in euthermic control bats and bats in torpor. Our results showed that compared to euthermic controls, significant, albeit modest (1.2-1.6 fold), increases in transcript expression were observed for eight mature miRNAs, including miR-1a-1, miR-29b, miR-181b, miR-15a, miR-20a, miR-206 and miR-128-1, in the pectoral muscle of torpid bats. Conversely, expression of miR-21 decreased by 80% during torpor, while expression of miR-107 remained unaffected. Interestingly, these miRNAs have been either validated or predicted to affect multiple muscle-specific factors, including myostatin, FoxO3a, HDAC4 and SMAD7, and are likely involved in the preservation of pectoral muscle mass and functionality during bat hibernation.

"SCAND3 and KRBA2 are two mammalian proteins originally described as ""cellular-integrases"" due to sharing of a similar DDE-type integrase domain whose origin and relationship with other recombinases remain unclear. Here we perform phylogenetic analyses of 341 integrase/transposase sequences to reveal that the integrase domain of SCAND3 and KRBA2 derives from the same clade of GINGER2, a superfamily of cut-and-paste transposons widely distributed in insects and other protostomes, but seemingly absent or extinct in vertebrates. Finally, we integrate the results of phylogenetic analyses to the taxonomic distribution of SCAND3 and KRBA2 and their transposon relatives to discuss some of the processes that promoted the emergence of these two chimeric genes during mammalian evolution.

"Next-generation sequencing technologies offer new approaches for global measurements of gene expression but are mostly limited to organisms for which a high-quality assembled reference genome sequence is available. We present a method for gene expression profiling called EDGE, or EcoP15I-tagged Digital Gene Expression, based on ultra-high-throughput sequencing of 27-bp cDNA fragments that uniquely tag the corresponding gene, thereby allowing direct quantification of transcript abundance. We show that EDGE is capable of assaying for expression in >99% of genes in the genome and achieves saturation after 6-8 million reads. EDGE exhibits very little technical noise, reveals a large (10(6)) dynamic range of gene expression, and is particularly suited for quantification of transcript abundance in non-model organisms where a high-quality annotated genome is not available. In a direct comparison with RNA-seq, both methods provide similar assessments of relative transcript abundance, but EDGE does better at detecting gene expression differences for poorly expressed genes and does not exhibit transcript length bias. Applying EDGE to laboratory mice, we show that a loss-of-function mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (Mc1r), recognized as a Mendelian determinant of yellow hair color in many different mammals, also causes reduced expression of genes involved in the interferon response. To illustrate the application of EDGE to a non-model organism, we examine skin biopsy samples from a cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and identify genes likely to control differences in the color of spotted versus non-spotted regions.

"Although no physical fossils of viruses have been found, retroviruses are known to leave their molecular fossils in the genomes of their hosts, the so-called endogenous retroviral elements. These have provided us with important information about retroviruses in the past and their co-evolution with their hosts. On the other hand, because non-retroviral viruses were considered not to leave such fossils, even the existence of prehistoric non-retroviral viruses has been enigmatic. Recently, we discovered that elements derived from ancient bornaviruses, non-segmented, negative strand RNA viruses, are found in the genomes of several mammalian species, including humans. In addition, at approximately the same time, several endogenous elements of RNA viruses, DNA viruses and reverse-transcribing DNA viruses have been independently reported, which revealed that non-retroviral viruses have played significant roles in the evolution of their hosts and provided novel insights into virology and cell biology. Here we review non-retroviral virus-like elements in vertebrate genomes, non-retroviral integration and the knowledge obtained from these endogenous non-retroviral virus-like elements.

"We have previously shown that a massive increase in global SUMOylation occurs during torpor in ground squirrels, and that overexpression of Ubc9 and/or SUMO-1 in cell lines and cortical neurons protects against oxygen and glucose deprivation. To examine whether increased global SUMOylation protects against ischemic brain damage, we have generated transgenic mice in which Ubc9 is expressed strongly in all tissues under the chicken β-actin promoter. Ubc9 expression levels in 10 founder lines ranged from 2 to 30 times the endogenous level, and lines that expressed Ubc9 at modestly increased levels showed robust resistance to brain ischemia compared to wild type mice. The infarction size was inversely correlated with the Ubc9 expression levels for up to five times the endogenous level. Although further increases showed no additional benefit, the Ubc9 expression level was highly correlated with global SUMO-1 conjugation levels (and SUMO-2,3 levels to a lesser extent) up to a five-fold Ubc9 increase. Most importantly, there were striking reciprocal relationships between SUMO-1 (and SUMO-2,3) conjugation levels and cerebral infarction volumes among all tested animals, suggesting that the limit in cytoprotection by global SUMOylation remains undefined. These results support efforts to further augment global protein SUMOylation in brain ischemia.

"Many arctic mammals are adapted to live year-round in extreme environments with low winter temperatures and great seasonal variations in key variables (e.g. sunlight, food, temperature, moisture). The interaction between hosts and pathogens in high northern latitudes is not very well understood with respect to intra-annual cycles (seasons). The annual cycles of interacting pathogen and host biology is regulated in part by highly synchronized temperature and photoperiod changes during seasonal transitions (e.g., freezeup and breakup). With a warming climate, only one of these key biological cues will undergo drastic changes, while the other will remain fixed. This uncoupling can theoretically have drastic consequences on host-pathogen interactions. These poorly understood cues together with a changing climate by itself will challenge host populations that are adapted to pathogens under the historic and current climate regime. We will review adaptations of both host and pathogens to the extreme conditions at high latitudes and explore some potential consequences of rapid changes in the Arctic.

"An ideal animal model for the study of a human disease is one which utilizes a route of infection that mimics the natural transmission of the pathogen; the ability to obtain disease with an infectious dose equivalent to that causing disease in humans; as well having a disease course, morbidity and mortality similar to that seen with human disease. Additionally, the animal model should have a mode(s) of transmission that mimics human cases. The development of small animal models for the study of monkeypox virus (MPXV) has been quite extensive for the relatively short period of time this pathogen has been known, although only a few of these models have been used to study anti-poxvirus agents. We will review those MPXV small animal models that have been developed thus far for the study of therapeutic agents.

"During hibernation in the 13-lined ground squirrel, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus, the cerebral cortex is electrically silent, yet the brainstem continues to regulate cardiorespiratory function. Previous work showed that neurons in slices through the medullary ventral respiratory column (VRC) but not the cortex are insensitive to high doses of pentobarbital during hibernation, leading to the hypothesis that GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R) in the VRC undergo a seasonal modification in subunit composition. To test whether alteration of GABA(A)R subunits are responsible for hibernation-associated pentobarbital insensitivity, we examined an array of subunits using RT-PCR and Western blots and identified changes in ε- and δ-subunits in the medulla but not the cortex. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed that during hibernation, the expression of ε-subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs nearly doubles in the VRC. We also identified a population of δ-subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs adjacent to the VRC that were differentially expressed during hibernation. As δ-subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs are particularly sensitive to ethanol (EtOH), multichannel electrodes were inserted in slices of medulla and cortex from hibernating squirrels and EtOH was applied. EtOH, which normally inhibits neuronal activity, excited VRC but not cortical neurons during hibernation. This excitation was prevented by bicuculline pretreatment, indicating the involvement of GABA(A)Rs. We propose that neuronal activity in the VRC during hibernation is unaffected by pentobarbital due to upregulation of ε-subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs on VRC neurons. Synaptic input from adjacent inhibitory interneurons that express δ-subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs is responsible for the excitatory effects of EtOH on VRC neurons during hibernation.

"Mammals that hibernate (hibernators) exhibit a circannual rhythm of food intake and body mass. In the laboratory during the winter hibernation period, many hibernators enter a series of multi-day torpor bouts, dropping their body temperature to near ambient, and cease to feed even if food is present in their cage. The mechanism(s) that regulates food intake in hibernators is unclear. Recently, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to play a key role in the central regulation of food intake in mammals. We hypothesized that infusing an AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1 B-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into the third ventricle of the hypothalamus would stimulate yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventris) to feed during their hibernation season. Infusion of AICAR ICV into marmots at an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C caused a significant (P<0.05) increase in food intake. In addition, animals stimulated to feed did not enter torpor during the infusion period. Marmots ICV infused with saline did not increase food intake and these animals continued to undergo torpor at an ambient temperature of 22 degrees C. Our results suggest that AICAR stimulated the food intake pathway, presumably by activating AMPK. These results support the hypothesis that AMPK may be involved in regulating food intake in hibernators and that there may be common neural pathways involved in regulating feeding and eliciting torpor.

"The black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) is a member of the order Rodentia and the family Sciuridae. Ecologically, prairie dogs are a keystone species in prairie ecology. This species is used as an animal model for human gallbladder disease and diseases caused by infection with Clostridium difficile, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and most recently, Orthopoxvirus. Despite increasing numbers of prairie dogs used in research and kept as pets, few data are available on their baseline physiology in animal facility housing conditions. To establish baseline physiologic reference ranges, we designed a study using 18 wild-caught black-tailed prairie dogs. Telemetry data were analyzed to establish circadian rhythms for activity and temperature. In addition, hematologic and serum chemistry analyses were performed. Baseline measurements were used to establish the mean for each animal, which then were compiled and analyzed to determine the reference ranges. Here we present physiologic data on serum chemistry and hematology profiles, as well as weight, core body temperature, and daily activity patterns for black-tailed prairie dogs. These results reflect the use of multiple measurements from species- and age-matched prairie dogs and likely will be useful to ecologists, scientists interested in using this animal model in research, and veterinarians caring for pet prairie dogs.

"BACKGROUND: Most rapidly evolving gene families are involved in immune responses and reproduction, two biological functions which have been assigned to the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family. To gain insights into evolutionary forces shaping the CEA gene family we have analysed this gene family in 27 mammalian species including monotreme and marsupial lineages. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis provided convincing evidence that the primordial CEA gene family in mammals consisted of five genes, including the immune inhibitory receptor-encoding CEACAM1 (CEA-related cell adhesion molecule) ancestor. Our analysis of the substitution rates within the nucleotide sequence which codes for the ligand binding domain of CEACAM1 indicates that the selection for diversification is, perhaps, a consequence of the exploitation of CEACAM1 by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens as their cellular receptor. Depending on the extent of the amplification of an ancestral CEACAM1, the number of CEACAM1-related genes varies considerably between mammalian species from less than five in lagomorphs to more than 100 in bats. In most analysed species, ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) or ITAM-like motif-containing proteins exist which contain Ig-V-like, ligand binding domains closely related to that of CEACAM1. Human CEACAM3 is one such protein which can function as a CEACAM1 decoy receptor in granulocytes by mediating the uptake and destruction of specific bacterial pathogens via its ITAM-like motif. The close relationship between CEACAM1 and its ITAM-encoding relatives appears to be maintained by gene conversion and reciprocal recombination. Surprisingly, secreted CEACAMs resembling immunomodulatory CEACAM1-related trophoblast-specific pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) found in humans and rodents evolved only in a limited set of mammals. The appearance of PSG-like genes correlates with invasive trophoblast growth in these species. CONCLUSIONS: These phylogenetic studies provide evidence that pathogen/host coevolution and a possible participation in fetal-maternal conflict processes led to a highly species-specific diversity of mammalian CEA gene families.

"Retroviruses are the only group of viruses known to have left a fossil record, in the form of endogenous proviruses, and approximately 8% of the human genome is made up of these elements. Although many other viruses, including non-retroviral RNA viruses, are known to generate DNA forms of their own genomes during replication, none has been found as DNA in the germline of animals. Bornaviruses, a genus of non-segmented, negative-sense RNA virus, are unique among RNA viruses in that they establish persistent infection in the cell nucleus. Here we show that elements homologous to the nucleoprotein (N) gene of bornavirus exist in the genomes of several mammalian species, including humans, non-human primates, rodents and elephants. These sequences have been designated endogenous Borna-like N (EBLN) elements. Some of the primate EBLNs contain an intact open reading frame (ORF) and are expressed as mRNA. Phylogenetic analyses showed that EBLNs seem to have been generated by different insertional events in each specific animal family. Furthermore, the EBLN of a ground squirrel was formed by a recent integration event, whereas those in primates must have been formed more than 40 million years ago. We also show that the N mRNA of a current mammalian bornavirus, Borna disease virus (BDV), can form EBLN-like elements in the genomes of persistently infected cultured cells. Our results provide the first evidence for endogenization of non-retroviral virus-derived elements in mammalian genomes and give novel insights not only into generation of endogenous elements, but also into a role of bornavirus as a source of genetic novelty in its host.

"In general, splicing regulatory elements are defined as Enhancers or Silencers depending on their positive or negative effect upon exon inclusion. Often, these sequences are usually present separate from each other in exonic/intronic sequences. The Composite Exonic Splicing Regulatory Elements (CERES) represent an extreme physical overlap of enhancer/silencer activity. As a result, when CERES elements are mutated the consequences on the splicing process are difficult to predict. Here, we show that the functional activity of the CERES2 sequence in CFTR exon 12 is regulated by the binding, in very close proximity to each other, of several SR and hnRNP proteins. Moreover, our results show that practically the entire exon 12 sequence context participate in its definition. The consequences of this situation can be observed at the evolutionary level by comparing changes in conservation of different splicing elements in different species. In conclusion, our study highlights how it is increasingly difficult to define many exonic sequences by simply breaking them down in isolated enhancer/silencer or even neutral elements. The real picture is close to one of continuous competition between positive and negative factors where affinity for the target sequences and other dynamic factors decide the inclusion or exclusion of the exon.

"1Avian influenza (AI) viruses primarily circulate in wild waterfowl populations and are occasionally transmitted to domestic poultry flocks. However, the possible roles of other wildlife species, such as wild mammals, in AI virus ecology have not been adequately addressed.2Due to their habitat and behaviour, many wild mammals may be capable of transmitting pathogens among wild and domestic populations. Exposure to AI viruses has been reported in an array of wild and domestic animals. The presence of wild mammals on farms has been identified as a risk factor for at least one poultry AI outbreak in North America. These reports suggest the need for seroprevalence studies examining the exposure of wild mammals to AI viruses.3Serological tests are routinely used to assess domestic poultry, domestic swine and human exposure to influenza A viruses, but these tests have not been validated for use in wild mammals. As such, some of these protocols may require adjustments or may be inappropriate for use in serology testing of wild mammals. Herein, we review these serological techniques and evaluate their potential usefulness in AI surveillance of wild mammals. We call for care to be taken when applying serological tests outside their original area of validation, and for continued assay verification for multiple species and virus strains.

"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is the first enzyme in the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenines formed in this pathway chemically modify proteins and cause apoptosis in cells. Evidence suggests that kynurenines and their protein modifications are involved in cataract formation, but this has yet to be directly demonstrated. We generated transgenic (Tg) mouse lines that overexpress human IDO in the lens. Homozygous Tg (homTg) lenses had higher IDO immunoreactivity, approximately 4.5 times greater IDO mRNA, and approximately 8 times higher IDO activity compared to lenses from hemizygous Tg (hemTg) animals. The kynurenine content was threefold higher in homTg than in hemTg but was not detected in wild-type (Wt) lenses. Kynurenine modifications were approximately 2.6 times greater in homTg than in hemTg or Wt. HomTg lenses had vacuoles in the epithelium and cortical fiber cells. Kynurenine modifications coincided with apoptosis in the secondary fiber cells of homTg lenses. Caspase-3 and caspase-9 activities were markedly higher in homTg than in hemTg and Wt. The glutathione content was approximately 36% lower in homTg compared to hemTg and Wt lenses. HomTg animals also developed bilateral cataracts within 3 months of birth. Together these data demonstrate that IDO-mediated production of kynurenines results in defects in fiber cell differentiation and their apoptosis and suggest that IDO activity is kept low in the lens to prevent deleterious effects by kynurenines.

"BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing and polyadenylation are important mechanisms for creating the proteomic diversity necessary for the nervous system to fulfill its specialized functions. The contribution of alternative splicing to proteomic diversity in the nervous system has been well documented, whereas the role of alternative polyadenylation in this process is less well understood. Since the CstF-64 polyadenylation protein is known to be an important regulator of tissue-specific polyadenylation, we examined its expression in brain and other organs. RESULTS: We discovered several closely related splice variants of CstF-64 - collectively called betaCstF-64 - that could potentially contribute to proteomic diversity in the nervous system. The betaCstF-64 splice variants are found predominantly in the brains of several vertebrate species including mice and humans. The major betaCstF-64 variant mRNA is generated by inclusion of two alternate exons (that we call exons 8.1 and 8.2) found between exons 8 and 9 of the CstF-64 gene, and contains an additional 147 nucleotides, encoding 49 additional amino acids. Some variants of betaCstF-64 contain only the first alternate exon (exon 8.1) while other variants contain both alternate exons (8.1 and 8.2). In mice, the predominant form of betaCstF-64 also contains a deletion of 78 nucleotides from exon 9, although that variant is not seen in any other species examined, including rats. Immunoblot and 2D-PAGE analyses of mouse nuclear extracts indicate that a protein corresponding to betaCstF-64 is expressed in brain at approximately equal levels to CstF-64. Since betaCstF-64 splice variant family members were found in the brains of all vertebrate species examined (including turtles and fish), this suggests that betaCstF-64 has an evolutionarily conserved function in these animals. betaCstF-64 was present in both pre- and post-natal mice and in different regions of the nervous system, suggesting an important role for betaCstF-64 in neural gene expression throughout development. Finally, experiments in representative cell lines suggest that betaCstF-64 is expressed in neurons but not glia. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a family of splice variants encoding a key polyadenylation protein that is expressed in a nervous system-specific manner. We propose that betaCstF-64 contributes to proteomic diversity by regulating alternative polyadenylation of neural mRNAs.

"Inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exhibit stereotyped traits that are variably expressed in each person. In experimental mouse models of chronic lung disease, these individual disease traits can be genetically segregated and thereby linked to distinct determinants. Functional genomic analysis indicates that at least one of these traits, mucous cell metaplasia, depends on members of the calcium-activated chloride channel (CLCA) gene family. Here we review advances in the biochemistry of the CLCA family and the evidence of a role for CLCA family members in the development of mucous cell metaplasia and possibly airway hyperreactivity in experimental models and in humans. On the basis of this information, we develop the model that CLCA proteins are not integral membrane proteins with ion channel function but instead are secreted signaling molecules that specifically regulate airway target cells in healthy and disease conditions.

"The KCNMB3 gene encodes one of a family of four auxiliary beta subunits found in the mammalian genome that associate with Slo1 alpha subunits and regulate BK channel function. In humans, the KCNMB3 gene contains four N-terminal alternative exons that produce four functionally distinct beta3 subunits, beta3a-d. Three variants, beta3a-c, exhibit kinetically distinct inactivation behaviors. Since investigation of the physiological roles of BK auxiliary subunits will depend on studies in rodents, here we have determined the identity and functional properties of mouse beta3 variants. Whereas beta1, beta2, and beta4 subunits exhibit 83.2%, 95.3%, and 93.8% identity between mouse and human, the mouse beta3 subunit, excluding N-terminal splice variants, shares only 62.8% amino acid identity with its human counterpart. Based on an examination of the mouse genome and screening of mouse cDNA libraries, here we have identified only two N-terminal candidates, beta3a and beta3b, of the four found in humans. Both human and mouse beta3a subunits produce a characteristic use-dependent inactivation. Surprisingly, whereas the hbeta3b exhibits rapid inactivation, the putative mbeta3b does not inactivate. Furthermore, unlike hbeta3, the mbeta3 subunit, irrespective of the N terminus, mediates a shift in gating to more negative potentials at a given Ca(2+) concentration. The shift in gating gradually is lost following patch excision, suggesting that the gating shift involves some regulatory process dependent on the cytosolic milieu. Examination of additional genomes to assess conservation among splice variants suggests that the putative mbeta3b N terminus may not be a true orthologue of the hbeta3b N terminus and that both beta3c and beta3d appear likely to be primate-specific N-terminal variants. These results have three key implications: first, functional properties of homologous beta3 subunits may differ among mammalian species; second, the specific physiological roles of homologous beta3 subunits may differ among mammalian species; and, third, some beta3 variants may be primate-specific ion channel subunits.

"Human mast cell tryptases vary strikingly in secretion, catalytic competence, and inheritance. To explore the basis of variation, we compared genes from a range of primates, including humans, great apes (chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan), Old- and New-World monkeys (macaque and marmoset), and a prosimian (galago), tracking key changes. Our analysis reveals that extant soluble tryptase-like proteins, including alpha- and beta-like tryptases, mastins, and implantation serine proteases, likely evolved from membrane-anchored ancestors because their more deeply rooted relatives (gamma tryptases, pancreasins, prostasins) are type I transmembrane peptidases. Function-altering mutations appeared at widely separated times during primate speciation, with tryptases evolving by duplication, gene conversion, and point mutation. The alpha-tryptase Gly(216)Asp catalytic domain mutation, which diminishes activity, is present in macaque tryptases, and thus arose before great apes and Old World monkeys shared an ancestor, and before the alphabeta split. However, the Arg(-3)Gln processing mutation appeared recently, affecting only human alpha. By comparison, the transmembrane gamma-tryptase gene, which anchors the telomeric end of the multigene tryptase locus, changed little during primate evolution. Related transmembrane peptidase genes were found in reptiles, amphibians, and fish. We identified soluble tryptase-like genes in the full spectrum of mammals, including marsupial (opossum) and monotreme (platypus), but not in nonmammalian vertebrates. Overall, our analysis suggests that soluble tryptases evolved rapidly from membrane-anchored, two-chain peptidases in ancestral vertebrates into soluble, single-chain, self-compartmentalizing, inhibitor-resistant oligomers expressed primarily by mast cells, and that much of present numerical, behavioral, and genetic diversity of alpha- and beta-like tryptases was acquired during primate evolution.

"Hibernation is a unique phenotype displayed by a phylogenetically diverse group of organisms including several species of mammals and one species of primate. Here we review evidence for blood and tissue borne signaling molecules in hibernating animals, achievements in isolating and characterizing these molecules, and potential medicinal applications.

"The growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein, GADD34, was identified by its interaction with human inhibitor 1 (I-1), a protein kinase A (PKA)-activated inhibitor of type 1 protein serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1), in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library. Recombinant GADD34 (amino acids 233 to 674) bound both PKA-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated I-1(1-171). Serial truncations mapped the C terminus of I-1 (amino acids 142 to 171) as essential for GADD34 binding. In contrast, PKA phosphorylation was required for PP1 binding and inhibition by the N-terminal I-1(1-80) fragment. Pulldowns of GADD34 proteins expressed in HEK293T cells showed that I-1 bound the central domain of GADD34 (amino acids 180 to 483). By comparison, affinity isolation of cellular GADD34/PP1 complexes showed that PP1 bound near the C terminus of GADD34 (amino acids 483 to 619), a region that shows sequence homology with the virulence factors ICP34.5 of herpes simplex virus and NL-S of avian sarcoma virus. While GADD34 inhibited PP1-catalyzed dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a, the GADD34-bound PP1 was an active eIF-2alpha phosphatase. In brain extracts from active ground squirrels, GADD34 bound both I-1 and PP1 and eIF-2alpha was largely dephosphorylated. In contrast, the I-1/GADD34 and PP1/GADD34 interactions were disrupted in brain from hibernating animals, in which eIF-2alpha was highly phosphorylated at serine-51 and protein synthesis was inhibited. These studies suggested that modification of the I-1/GADD34/PP1 signaling complex regulates the initiation of protein translation in mammalian tissues.

"Here we present the first complete genomic sequence, with analysis, of a very virulent strain of Marek's disease virus serotype 1 (MDV1), Md5. The genome is 177,874 bp and is predicted to encode 103 proteins. MDV1 is colinear with the prototypic alphaherpesvirus herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) within the unique long (UL) region, and it is most similar at the amino acid level to MDV2, herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT), and nonavian herpesviruses equine herpesviruses 1 and 4. MDV1 encodes 55 HSV-1 UL homologues together with 6 additional UL proteins that are absent in nonavian herpesviruses. The unique short (US) region is colinear with and has greater than 99% nucleotide identity to that of MDV1 strain GA; however, an extra nucleotide sequence at the Md5 US/short terminal repeat boundary results in a shorter US region and the presence of a second gene (encoding MDV097) similar to the SORF2 gene. MD5, like HVT, encodes an ICP4 homologue that contains a 900-amino-acid amino-terminal extension not found in other herpesviruses. Putative virulence and host range gene products include the oncoprotein MEQ, oncogenicity-associated phosphoproteins pp38 and pp24, a lipase homologue, a CxC chemokine, and unique proteins of unknown function MDV087 and MDV097 (SORF2 homologues) and MDV093 (SORF4). Consistent with its virulent phenotype, Md5 contains only two copies of the 132-bp repeat which has previously been associated with viral attenuation and loss of oncogenicity.

"BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial function involves the interplay between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Such mitonuclear interactions can be disrupted by the introgression of mitochondrial DNA between taxa or divergent populations. Previous studies of several model systems (e.g. Drosophila) indicate that the disruption of mitonuclear interactions, termed mitonuclear mismatch, can alter nuclear gene expression, yet few studies have focused on natural populations. RESULTS: Here we study a naturally introgressed population in the secondary contact zone of two subspecies of the intermediate horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis), in which individuals possess either mitonuclear matched or mismatched genotypes. We generated transcriptome data for six tissue types from five mitonuclear matched and five mismatched individuals. Our results revealed strong tissue-specific effects of mitonuclear mismatch on nuclear gene expression with the largest effect seen in pectoral muscle. Moreover, consistent with the hypothesis that genes associated with the response to oxidative stress may be upregulated in mitonuclear mismatched individuals, we identified several such gene candidates, including DNASE1L3, GPx3 and HSPB6 in muscle, and ISG15 and IFI6 in heart. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals how mitonuclear mismatch arising from introgression in natural populations is likely to have fitness consequences. Underlying the processes that maintain mitonuclear discordance is a step forward to understand the role of mitonuclear interactions in population divergence and speciation.

"Natural history museum collections worldwide represent a tremendous resource of information on past and present biodiversity. Fish, reptiles, amphibians and many invertebrate collections have often been preserved in ethanol for decades or centuries and our knowledge on the genomic and metagenomic research potential of such material is limited. Here, we use ancient DNA protocols, combined with shotgun sequencing to test the molecular preservation in liver, skin and bone tissue from five old (1842 to 1964) museum specimens of the common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis). When mapping reads to a T. sirtalis reference genome, we find that the DNA molecules are highly damaged with short average sequence lengths (38-64 bp) and high C-T deamination, ranging from 9% to 21% at the first position. Despite this, the samples displayed relatively high endogenous DNA content, ranging from 26% to 56%, revealing that genome-scale analyses are indeed possible from all specimens and tissues included here. Of the three tested types of tissue, bone shows marginally but significantly higher DNA quality in these metrics. Though at least one of the snakes had been exposed to formalin, neither the concentration nor the quality of the obtained DNA was affected. Lastly, we demonstrate that these specimens display a diverse and tissue-specific microbial genetic profile, thus offering authentic metagenomic data despite being submerged in ethanol for many years. Our results emphasize that historical museum collections continue to offer an invaluable source of information in the era of genomics.

"There is growing interest in the study of avian endoparasite communities, and metabarcoding is a promising approach to complement more conventional or targeted methods. In the case of eukaryotic endoparasites, phylogenetic diversity is extreme, with parasites from 4 kingdoms and 11 phyla documented in birds. We addressed this challenge by comparing different primer sets across 16 samples from 5 bird species. Samples consisted of blood, feces, and controlled mixes with known proportions of bird and nematode DNA. Illumina sequencing revealed that a 28S primer set used in combination with a custom blocking primer allowed detection of various plasmodiid parasites and filarioid nematodes in the blood, coccidia in the feces, as well as two potentially pathogenic fungal groups. When tested on the controlled DNA mixes, these primers also increased the proportion of nematode DNA by over an order of magnitude. An 18S primer set, originally designed to exclude metazoan sequences, was the most effective at reducing the relative number of avian DNA sequences and was the only one to detect Trypanosoma in the blood. Expectedly, however, it did not allow nematode detection and also failed to detect avian malaria parasites. This study shows that a 28S set including a blocking primer allows detection of several major and very diverse bird parasite clades, while reliable amplification of all major parasite groups may require a combination of markers. It helps clarify options for bird parasite metabarcoding, according to priorities in terms of the endoparasite clades and the ecological questions researchers wish to focus on.

"Human granulocytic anaplasmosis, a tickborne disease caused by the bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum, was first identified during 1994 and is now an emerging public health threat in the United States. New York state (NYS) has experienced a recent increase in the incidence of anaplasmosis. We analyzed human case surveillance and tick surveillance data collected by the NYS Department of Health for spatiotemporal patterns of disease emergence. We describe the epidemiology and growing incidence of anaplasmosis cases reported during 2010-2018. Spatial analysis showed an expanding hot spot of anaplasmosis in the Capital Region, where incidence increased >8-fold. The prevalence of A. phagocytophilum increased greatly within tick populations in the Capital Region over the same period, and entomologic risk factors were correlated with disease incidence at a local level. These results indicate that anaplasmosis is rapidly emerging in a geographically focused area of NYS, likely driven by localized changes in exposure risk.

"Humans and wildlife are at risk from certain vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and West Nile and yellow fevers. Factors linked to global change, including habitat alteration, land-use intensification, the spread of alien species, and climate change, are operating on a global scale and affect both the incidence and distribution of many vector-borne diseases. Hence, understanding the drivers that regulate the transmission of pathogens in the wild is of great importance for ecological, evolutionary, health, and economic reasons. In this literature review, we discuss the ecological factors potentially affecting the transmission of two mosquito-borne pathogens circulating naturally between birds and mosquitoes, namely, West Nile virus (WNV) and the avian malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium. Traditionally, the study of pathogen transmission has focused only on vectors or hosts and the interactions between them, while the role of landscape has largely been ignored. However, from an ecological point of view, it is essential not only to study the interaction between each of these organisms but also to understand the environmental scenarios in which these processes take place. We describe here some of the similarities and differences in the transmission of these two pathogens and how research into both systems may facilitate a greater understanding of the dynamics of vector-borne pathogens in the wild.

"Muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), a taxonomically unique Arctic species, are increasingly exposed to climate and other anthropogenic changes. It is critical to develop and validate reliable tools to monitor their physiological stress response in order to assess the impacts of these changes. Here, we measured fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) levels in response to the administration of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the winter (1 IU/kg) and summer (2 IU/kg) using two enzyme immunoassays, one targeting primarily cortisol and the other targeting primarily corticosterone. Fecal cortisol levels varied substantially within and among individuals, and none of the animals in either challenge showed an increase in fecal cortisol following the injection of ACTH. By contrast, two of six (winter) and two of five (summer) muskoxen showed a clear response in fecal corticosterone levels (i.e., maximal percentage increase as compared to time 0 levels > 100%). Increases in fecal corticosterone post-ACTH injection occurred earlier and were of shorter duration in the summer than in the winter and fecal corticosterone levels were, in general, lower during the summer. These seasonal differences in FGM responses may be related to the use of different individuals (i.e., influence of sex, age, social status, etc.) and to seasonal variations in the metabolism and excretion of glucocorticoids, intestinal transit time, voluntary food intake, and fecal output and moisture content. Results from this study support using FGMs as a biomarker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in muskoxen, advance our understanding of the physiological adaptations of mammals living in highly seasonal and extreme environments such as the Arctic, and emphasize the importance of considering seasonality in other species when interpreting FGM levels.

"BACKGROUND: The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. METHODS: Over a 15-year period (2004-2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2 years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). RESULTS: We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2 years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. CONCLUSIONS: Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis.

"Caudal autotomy in rodents is an evolutionarily acquired phenomenon enabling escape from predators, by discarding the tail skin after traumatic injuries. The histological mechanisms underlying caudal autotomy seem to differ among species. Cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), which are important laboratory rodents for human infectious diseases, possess a fragile tail. In this study, we compared the tail histology of cotton rats with that of laboratory rats (Rattus norvegicus), which have no fragility on their tail, to elucidate the process of rodent caudal autotomy. First, the cotton rats developed a false autotomy characterized by loss of the tail sheath with the caudal vertebrae remaining without tail regeneration. Second, we found the fracture plane was continuous from the interscale of the tail epidermis to the dermis, which was lined with an alignment of E-cadherin(+) cells. Third, we found an obvious cleavage plane between the dermis and subjacent tissues of the cotton-rat tail, where the subcutis was composed of looser, finer, and fragmented collagen fibers compared with those of the rat. Additionally, the cotton-rat tail was easily torn, with minimum bleeding. The median coccygeal artery of the cotton rat had a thick smooth muscle layer, and its lumen was filled with the peeled intima with fibrin coagulation, which might be associated with reduced bleeding following caudal autotomy. Taken together, we reveal the unique histological features of the tail relating to the caudal autotomy process in the cotton rat, and provide novel insights to help clarify the rodent caudal autotomy mechanism.

"The ecology and host feeding patterns of many soft ticks (Ixodida: Argasidae) remain poorly understood. To address soft tick-host feeding associations, we fed Ornithodoros turicata Dugès on multiple host species and evaluated quantitative PCR (qPCR) and stable isotope analyses to identify the vertebrate species used for the bloodmeal. The results showed that a qPCR with host-specific probes for the cytochrome b gene successfully identified bloodmeals from chicken (Gallus gallus L.), goat (Capra aegagrus hircus L), and swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) beyond 330 days post-feeding and through multiple molting. Also, qPCR-based bloodmeal analyses could detect multiple host species within individual ticks that fed upon more than one species. The stable isotope bloodmeal analyses were based on variation in the natural abundance of carbon ((13)C/(12)C) and nitrogen ((15)N/(14)N) isotopes in ticks fed on different hosts. When compared to reference isotope signatures, this method discerned unique δ(13)C and δ(15)N signatures in the ticks fed on each host taxa yet could not discern multiple host species from O. turicata that fed on more than one host species. Given the significance of soft tick-borne zoonoses and animal diseases, elucidating host feeding patterns from field-collected ticks using these methods may provide insight for an ecological basis to disease management.

"BACKGROUND: Small mammals are important maintenance hosts of ectoparasites as well as reservoir hosts for many arthropod-borne pathogens. In Germany, only a few studies have investigated ectoparasite communities on small mammals in their natural habitats. The aim of this study was to assess the species diversity and parameters influencing the mean intensity and prevalence of macroscopically visible ectoparasites, such as fleas, predatory mites and ticks. METHODS: A total of 779 small mammals and 3383 ticks were available from earlier investigations for the data analysis of the current study from three differently structured study sites. In addition, fleas and predatory mites were collected from the captured rodents and taxonomically identified. Regression analyses were conducted on the group (ticks/mites/fleas) and species levels using hurdle models for the abundance of ectoparasite groups and a negative binomial model for the abundance of species. RESULTS: Nearly 90% of the small mammals analyzed were infested with ectoparasites, with an average of 7.3 specimens per host. Hosts were infested with up to six species of ectoparasites simultaneously. In total, 12 flea, 11 mite and three tick species were detected. Ticks were more prevalent than fleas or mites, with > 80% of the hosts in urban and forest areas hosting ticks and around 60% of hosts presenting fleas, and only 20-40% of hosts presenting mites. Polyparasitism had a statistically significant influence on the prevalence of the investigated tick, mite and flea species, with odds ratios of > 1.0. Trapping location, season and host characteristics had significant influences on some-but not all-of the investigated species. CONCLUSIONS: The diversity of flea species was unexpectedly high and higher than that reported in comparable studies, which can be explained by the differently structured habitats and regions examined in this study. Polyparasitism was a key influencing factor and had a positive effect on the prevalence and/or abundance of the predominant tick, flea and mite species occurring on small mammals. Season, trapping location, host species and sex of the host species also had an influence on the prevalence and mean intensity of certain, but not all, ectoparasite species.

"Mosquito-borne viruses are well recognized as a global public health burden amongst humans, but the effects on non-human vertebrates is rarely reported. Australia, houses a number of endemic mosquito-borne viruses, such as Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. In this review, we synthesize the current state of mosquito-borne viruses impacting non-human vertebrates in Australia, including diseases that could be introduced due to local mosquito distribution. Given the unique island biogeography of Australia and the endemism of vertebrate species (including macropods and monotremes), Australia is highly susceptible to foreign mosquito species becoming established, and mosquito-borne viruses becoming endemic alongside novel reservoirs. For each virus, we summarize the known geographic distribution, mosquito vectors, vertebrate hosts, clinical signs and treatments, and highlight the importance of including non-human vertebrates in the assessment of future disease outbreaks. The mosquito-borne viruses discussed can impact wildlife, livestock, and companion animals, causing significant changes to Australian ecology and economy. The complex nature of mosquito-borne disease, and challenges in assessing the impacts to non-human vertebrate species, makes this an important topic to periodically review.

"Hormesis is any kind of biphasic dose-response when low doses of some agents are beneficial while higher doses are detrimental. Radiation hormesis is the most thoroughly investigated among all hormesis-like phenomena, in particular in biogerontology. In this review, we aimed to summarize research evidence supporting hormesis through exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR). Radiation-induced longevity hormesis has been repeatedly reported in invertebrate models such as C. elegans, Drosophila and flour beetles and in vertebrate models including guinea pigs, mice and rabbits. On the contrary, suppressing natural background radiation was repeatedly found to cause detrimental effects in protozoa, bacteria and flies. We also discussed here the possibility of clinical use of LDIR, predominantly for age-related disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's disease, for which no remedies are available. There is accumulating evidence that LDIR, such as those commonly used in X-ray imaging including computer tomography, might act as a hormetin. Of course, caution should be exercised when introducing new medical practices, and LDIR therapy is no exception. However, due to the low average residual life expectancy in old patients, the short-term benefits of such interventions (e.g., potential therapeutic effect against dementia) may outweigh their hypothetical delayed risks (e.g., cancer). We argue here that assessment and clinical trials of LDIR treatments should be given priority bearing in mind the enormous economic, social and ethical implications of potentially-treatable, age-related disorders.

"Deer tick-transmitted Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Lyme disease) and Babesia microti (babesiosis) increasingly burden public health across eastern North America. The white-footed mouse is considered the primary host for subadult deer ticks and the most important reservoir host for these and other disease agents. Local transmission is thought to be modulated by less reservoir-competent hosts, such as deer, diverting ticks from feeding on mice. We measured the proportion of mouse-fed or deer-fed host-seeking nymphs from 4 sites during 2 transmission seasons by blood meal remnant analysis using a new retrotransposon-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. We then determined the host that was associated with the infection status of the tick. During the first year, the proportion of mouse-fed ticks ranged from 17% on mainland sites to 100% on an island, while deer-fed ticks ranged from 4% to 24%. The proportion of ticks feeding on mice and deer was greater from island sites than mainland sites (on average, 92% versus 43%). Mouse-fed ticks decreased significantly during year 2 in 3 of 4 sites (most were <20%), while deer-fed ticks increased for all sites (75% at one site). Overall, ticks were more likely to be infected when they had fed on mice (odds ratio [OR] of 2.4 and 1.6 for Borrelia and Babesia, respectively) and were less likely to be infected if they had fed on deer (OR, 0.8 and 0.4). We conclude that host utilization by deer ticks is characterized by significant spatiotemporal diversity, which may confound efficacy tests of interventions targeting reservoir hosts.IMPORTANCE White-footed mice are thought to be the most important reservoir host for the deer tick-transmitted pathogens that cause Lyme disease and human babesiosis because they are the primary host for immature ticks. Transmission would be reduced, however, if ticks feed on deer, which are not capable of infecting ticks with either pathogen. By directly measuring whether ticks had fed on either mice or deer using a new quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect remnants of host DNA leftover from the larval blood meal, we demonstrate that host utilization by ticks varies significantly over time and space and that mice often feed fewer ticks than expected. This finding has implications for our understanding of the ecology of these diseases and for the efficacy of control measures.

"Keeping exotic pets has become a popular habit in the UK in recent decades. Yet, information on the current scale of the trade and the diversity of animals involved is lacking. Here, we review the licensed sale of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals as exotic pets in the UK, identifying current geographical hotspots of trader activity, data gaps, and compliance issues related to this trade. In terms of trade volume, records showed large numbers of individual wild animals, across a wide range of species groups, are being legally sold in the UK. Maximum numbers of exotic pets permitted for sale included 54,634 amphibians, 64,810 reptiles, 23,507 birds, and 6,479 mammals. Moreover, nearly 2000 pet traders located in 283 different local authority areas had permission to sell exotic pets. The scope and scale of the trade draws additional attention to the substantial animal welfare challenges associated with it, and our review serves to highlight several shortcomings associated with the licensed exotic pet trade in the UK. Pet shop licences often lacked detailed information about the specific type and number of animals permitted for sale, which raises compliance concerns and hinders efforts to carry out adequate inspection and monitoring. Ninety-five pet traders in England had been given a one star rating, indicating 'minor failings' in animal welfare, and some local authorities in England were still operating under the old Pet Animals Act (1951). We recommend that resources should be prioritised and focused towards local authorities in England that are not operating under the new Animal Welfare (Licensing of Activities Involving Animals) (England) Regulations (2018), and that local authorities should improve data reporting on all licenses issued to aid inspection and monitoring.

"Lyme disease (LD) is an emerging zoonotic infection that is increasing in incidence in North America, Europe, and Asia. With the development of safe and efficacious vaccines, LD can potentially be prevented. Vaccination offers a cost-effective and safe approach for decreasing the risk of infection. While LD vaccines have been widely used in veterinary medicine, they are not available as a preventive tool for humans. Central to the development of effective vaccines is an understanding of the enzootic cycle of LD, differential gene expression of Borrelia burgdorferi in response to environmental variables, and the genetic and antigenic diversity of the unique bacteria that cause this debilitating disease. Here we review these areas as they pertain to past and present efforts to develop human, veterinary, and reservoir targeting LD vaccines. In addition, we offer a brief overview of additional preventative measures that should employed in conjunction with vaccination.

"The field distribution of the oral rabies vaccine is effective in controlling the spread of rabies. The present study aimed to investigate efficient distribution locations based on the environment, contact rate, and consumption by target wildlife species in South Korea. The target species (Korean raccoon dogs, domestic dogs, and feral cats) accounted for 945 contacts (52.2%), in total 1,808 contacts. There were 863 (47.8%) contacts by non-target species. Raccoon dogs, a main reservoir of rabies in South Korea, had the highest contact rate (34.1%) among all species. The contact rate by target species was highest at riparian sites and bushy mountainous vegetation, where raccoon dogs are abundant. There was remarkable contact by raccoon dogs in mountainous areas below 150 m with bushy vegetation. Our results indicate that these locations are efficient areas for vaccine distribution, especially targeting the raccoon dog. Vaccines were continuously contacted with intervals ranging from one hour to one day. Vaccines at 94.4% of the distribution points were completely consumed within two weeks. The mean consumption rate was 95.2 ± 1.93% during the overall study period. These findings suggest that the oral rabies vaccine attracts wildlife including domestic dogs and feral cats. Our results suggest that low sections of mountainous areas with bushy vegetation and/or neighboring riparian areas are rich in target wildlife species (especially raccoon dogs) and are efficient locations for vaccine distribution to control rabies in South Korea.

"Host behaviour can affect host-pathogen dynamics and theory predicts that certain individuals disproportionately infect conspecifics during an epidemic. Consistent individual differences in behaviour, or personality, could influence this variation with the most exploratory or sociable individuals most likely to spread pathogens. We quantified exploration and sociability in little brown bats (Myotis lucifugus) and then experimentally manipulated exposure to a proxy pathogen (i.e. ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent powder) to test two related hypotheses: (i) more sociable and more exploratory individuals would be more likely to transmit infections to other individuals, and (ii) more sociable and more exploratory individuals uninfected with an invading pathogen would be more likely to acquire infections. We captured 10 groups of 16 bats at a time and held each group in an outdoor flight tent equipped with roosting-boxes. We used hole-board and Y-maze tests to quantify exploration and sociability of each bat and randomly selected one individual from each group for 'infection' with non-toxic, UV fluorescent powder. Each group of 10 bats was released into the flight tent for 24 h, which represented an experimental infection trial. After 24 h, we removed bats from the trial, photographed each individual under UV light and quantified infection intensity from digital photographs. As predicted, the exploratory behaviour of the experimentally infected individual was positively correlated with infection intensity in their group-mates, while more exploratory females had higher pathogen acquisition. Our results highlight the potential influence of host personality and sex on pathogen dynamics in wildlife populations.

"Human-wildlife conflict is difficult to measure, but the analysis of records from wildlife rehabilitation facilities has shown potential as a technique for characterizing human impacts on wildlife. To examine the value of wildlife rehabilitation records for characterizing local human-wildlife conflicts and prevalence of select wildlife diseases, we reviewed 45,668 records representing over 280 species admitted to a wildlife rehabilitation facility over a 10-year period (2005-2014). We identified the most frequently recorded causes of admission for commonly admitted species, and evaluated how causes of admission may vary across taxa throughout the year. Our analyses support the value of wildlife rehabilitation facility data for characterizing some pressures from human-wildlife conflict and select disease trends for certain taxa, as well as utility for informing topics to emphasize in local conservation education efforts. For example, orphaned neonatal wildlife accounted for the largest proportion of admissions to this facility, and highlights a opportunity for conservation education regarding when wildlife is truly orphaned and requires professional intervention. Additionally, domestic dog attack cases accounted for a proportion of admissions comparable to that of domestic cat attacks, demonstrating a need for the conversation surrounding the impact of domestic pets on local wildlife to expand to include dogs in addition to cats.

"At any moment, there are millions of cats housed in foster care facilities for abandoned and stray animals for various reasons worldwide. Care, management and regulation among these facilities differ. Moreover, shelters can never substitute the full comfort of a good home for the animal, and the welfare of cats in shelters is a subject of discussion in many respects. Cats are animals sensitive to changes; for most of them, placement in a shelter is a stressful experience because of changes in routine, environment and the presence of other animals. Stress is reflected in changes in behaviour, causes fluctuations in physiological values and disrupts the immune system, which is a predisposition to the development or reactivation of disease. Evaluation of the presence and intensity of negative impacts is possible through the use of evaluation tools based on indicators that help set the environment and management of keeping so as to disrupt the quality of life as little as possible. Although a comprehensive and valid welfare tool that would evaluate animal-based and at the same time resource-based (or management-based) indicators of cats in shelters is not currently available, it is possible to use partial evaluation of individual welfare indicators to assess welfare. This review aims to provide the readers with an insight into current options of assessment of the welfare of cats in shelters with an emphasis on behavioural, physiological and health indicators with an application in both practical and scientific contexts.

"A fundamental question of current ecological research concerns the drives and limits of species responses to human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC). Behavioural responses to HIREC are a key component because behaviour links individual responses to population and community changes. Ongoing fast urbanization provides an ideal setting to test the functional role of behaviour for responses to HIREC. Consistent behavioural differences between conspecifics (animal personality) may be important determinants or constraints of animals' adaptation to urban habitats. We tested whether urban and rural populations of small mammals differ in mean trait expression, flexibility and repeatability of behaviours associated to risk-taking and exploratory tendencies. Using a standardized behavioural test in the field, we quantified spatial exploration and boldness of striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius, n = 96) from nine sub-populations, presenting different levels of urbanisation and anthropogenic disturbance. The level of urbanisation positively correlated with boldness, spatial exploration and behavioural flexibility, with urban dwellers being bolder, more explorative and more flexible in some traits than rural conspecifics. Thus, individuals seem to distribute in a non-random way in response to human disturbance based on their behavioural characteristics. Animal personality might therefore play a key role in successful coping with the challenges of HIREC.

"Stress physiology is commonly employed in studies of wildlife ecology and conservation. Accordingly, we need robust and suitable methods to measure stress physiology in the field. Fecal cortisol/corticosterone metabolites (FCMs) are now increasingly being used to non-invasively evaluate adrenocortical activity; a measure of stress physiology. However, immunoassays that measure FCMs must be appropriately validated prior to their use and factors that can influence FCMs, such as trap-induced stress, must be considered. Deermice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are widely used in scientific studies so that developing methods that appropriately measure their adrenocortical activity is critical. In the laboratory, we tested the suitability of two enzyme immunoassays (EIAs; a corticosterone EIA, and a group-specific 5α-pregnane-3β,11β,21-triol-20-one EIA) in deermice by challenging individuals with dexamethasone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). We found that dexamethasone suppressed FCM levels within ~10 h post injection whereas ACTH increased FCM levels within ~2&nbsp;h post injection. In the field, we found that FCM levels generally increased with more time in trap confinement when using both EIAs. Although we acknowledge low sample sizes (N = 4), our results validated the two EIAs for use with FCMs from deermice.

"Consistent among-individual variation in behavior, or animal personality, is present in a wide variety of species. This behavioral variation is maintained by both genetic and environmental factors. Parental effects are a special case of environmental variation and are expected to evolve in populations experiencing large fluctuations in their environment. They represent a non-genetic pathway by which parents can transmit information to their offspring, by modulating their personality. While it is expected that parental effects contribute to the observed personality variation, this has rarely been studied in wild populations. We used the multimammate mouse Mastomys natalensis as a model system to investigate the potential effects of maternal personality on offspring behavior. We did this by repeatedly recording the behavior of individually housed juveniles which were born and raised in the lab from wild caught females. A linear correlation, between mother and offspring in behavior, would be expected when the personality is only affected by additive genetic variation, while a more complex relationship would suggests the presence of maternal effects. We found that the personality of the mother predicted the behavior of their offspring in a non-linear pattern. Exploration behavior of mother and offspring was positively correlated, but only for slow and average exploring mothers, while this correlation became negative for fast exploring mothers. This may suggests that early maternal effects could affect personality in juvenile M. natalensis, potentially due to density-dependent and negative frequency-dependent mechanisms, and therefore contribute to the maintenance of personality variation.

"The mammalian diving response (DR) is a remarkable behavior that was first formally studied by Laurence Irving and Per Scholander in the late 1930s. The DR is called such because it is most prominent in marine mammals such as seals, whales, and dolphins, but nevertheless is found in all mammals studied. It consists generally of breathing cessation (apnea), a dramatic slowing of heart rate (bradycardia), and an increase in peripheral vasoconstriction. The DR is thought to conserve vital oxygen stores and thus maintain life by directing perfusion to the two organs most essential for life-the heart and the brain. The DR is important, not only for its dramatic power over autonomic function, but also because it alters normal homeostatic reflexes such as the baroreceptor reflex and respiratory chemoreceptor reflex. The neurons driving the reflex circuits for the DR are contained within the medulla and spinal cord since the response remains after the brainstem transection at the pontomedullary junction. Neuroanatomical and physiological data suggesting brainstem areas important for the apnea, bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction induced by underwater submersion are reviewed. Defining the brainstem circuit for the DR may open broad avenues for understanding the mechanisms of suprabulbar control of autonomic function in general, as well as implicate its role in some clinical states. Knowledge of the proposed diving circuit should facilitate studies on elite human divers performing breath-holding dives as well as investigations on sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), stroke, migraine headache, and arrhythmias. We have speculated that the DR is the most powerful autonomic reflex known.

"Mosquito-borne arboviruses are increasing due to human disturbances of natural ecosystems and globalization of trade and travel. These anthropic changes may affect mosquito communities by modulating ecological traits that influence the ""spill-over"" dynamics of zoonotic pathogens, especially at the interface between natural and human environments. Particularly, the global invasion of Aedes albopictus is observed not only across urban and peri-urban settings, but also in newly invaded areas in natural settings. This could foster the interaction of Ae. albopictus with wildlife, including local reservoirs of enzootic arboviruses, with implications for the potential zoonotic transfer of pathogens. To evaluate the potential of Ae. albopictus as a bridge vector of arboviruses between wildlife and humans, we performed a bibliographic search and analysis focusing on three components: (1) The capacity of Ae. albopictus to exploit natural larval breeding sites, (2) the blood-feeding behaviour of Ae. albopictus, and (3) Ae. albopictus' vector competence for arboviruses. Our analysis confirms the potential of Ae. albopictus as a bridge vector based on its colonization of natural breeding sites in newly invaded areas, its opportunistic feeding behaviour together with the preference for human blood, and the competence to transmit 14 arboviruses.

"Tickborne diseases are rare in Washington, USA, and the ecology of these pathogens is poorly understood. We integrated surveillance data from humans and ticks to better describe their epidemiology and ecology. During 2011-2016, a total of 202 tickborne disease cases were reported in Washington residents. Of these, 68 (34%) were autochthonous, including cases of Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tickborne relapsing fever, and tularemia. During May 2011-December 2016, we collected 977 host-seeking ticks, including Ixodes pacificus, I. angustus, I. spinipalpis, I. auritulus, Dermacentor andersoni, and D. variabilis ticks. The prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in I. pacificus ticks was 4.0%; of B. burgdorferi sensu lato, 3.8%; of B. miyamotoi, 4.4%; and of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, 1.9%. We did not detect Rickettsia rickettsii in either Dermacentor species. Case-patient histories and detection of pathogens in field-collected ticks indicate that several tickborne pathogens are endemic to Washington.

"We updated the Illinois historical (1905-December 2017) distribution and status (not reported, reported or established) maps for Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae), and Ixodes scapularis (Say) (Acari: Ixodidae) by compiling publicly available, previously unexplored or newly identified published and unpublished data (untapped data). Primary data sources offered specific tick-level information, followed by secondary and tertiary data sources. For A. americanum, D. variabilis, and I. scapularis, primary data contributed to 90% (4,045/4,482), 80% (2,124/2,640), and 32% (3,490/10,898) tick records vs 10%, 20%, and 68%, respectively from secondary data; primary data updated status in 95% (62/65), 94% (51/54) and in 90% (9/10) of the updated counties for each of these tick species; by 1985 there were tick records in 6%, 68%, and 0% of the counties, compared to 20%, 72%, and 58% by 2004, and 77%, 96%, and 75% of the counties by 2017, respectively for A. americanum, D. variabilis, and I. scapularis. We document the loss of tick records due to unidentified, not cataloged tick collections, unidentified ticks in tick collections, unpublished data or manuscripts without specific county location, and tick-level information, to determine distribution and status. In light of the increase in tick-borne illnesses, updates in historical distributions and status maps help researchers and health officials to identify risk areas for a tick encounter and suggest targeted areas for public outreach and surveillance efforts for ticks and tick-borne diseases. There is a need for a systematic, national vector surveillance program to support research and public health responses to tick expansions and tick-borne diseases.

"Lyme disease and human babesiosis are the most common tick-borne zoonoses in the Temperate Zone of North America. The number of infected patients has continued to rise globally, and these zoonoses pose a major healthcare threat. This tick-host-pathogen study was conducted to test for infectious microbes associated with Lyme disease and human babesiosis in Canada. Using the flagellin (flaB) gene, three members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) complex were detected, namely a Borrelia lanei-like spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss), and a distinct strain that may represent a separate Bbsl genospecies. This novel Bbsl strain was detected in a mouse tick, Ixodes muris, collected from a House Wren, Troglodytes aedon, in Quebec during the southward fall migration. The presence of Bbsl in bird-feeding larvae of I. muris suggests reservoir competency in three passerines (i.e., Common Yellowthroat, House Wren, Magnolia Warbler). Based on the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, three Babesia species (i.e., Babesia divergens-like, Babesia microti, Babesia odocoilei) were detected in field-collected ticks. Not only was B. odocoilei found in songbird-derived ticks, this piroplasm was apparent in adult questing blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, in southern Canada. By allowing live, engorged ticks to molt, we confirm the transstadial passage of Bbsl in I. muris and B. odocoilei in I. scapularis. Bbss and Babesia microti were detected concurrently in a groundhog tick, Ixodes cookei, in Western Ontario. In Alberta, a winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus, which was collected from a moose, Alces alces, tested positive for Bbss. Notably, a B. divergens-like piroplasm was detected in a rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, collected from an eastern cottontail in southern Manitoba; this Babesia species is a first-time discovery in Canada. This rabbit tick was also co-infected with Borrelia lanei-like spirochetes, which constitutes a first in Canada. Overall, five ticks were concurrently infected with Babesia and Bbsl pathogens and, after the molt, could potentially co-infect humans. Notably, we provide the first authentic report of I. scapularis ticks co-infected with Bbsl and B. odocoilei in Canada. The full extent of infectious microorganisms transmitted to humans by ticks is not fully elucidated, and clinicians need to be aware of the complexity of these tick-transmitted enzootic agents on human health. Diagnosis and treatment must be administered by those with accredited medical training in tick-borne zoonosis.

"Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is an important and neglected vector-borne zoonotic disease with an expanding known distribution. The ecology of the disease is complex and poorly understood, impairing discussion of public health interventions. To highlight what we know and the themes of our ignorance, we conducted a systematic review of all studies investigating the pathogen in vectors and non-human hosts. A total of 276 articles in 7 languages were included, with 793 study sites across 30 countries. There was no time restriction for article inclusion, with the oldest published in 1924. Seventy-six potential vector species and 234 vertebrate host species were tested, accounting for over one million trombiculid mites ('chiggers') and 83,000 vertebrates. The proportion of O. tsutsugamushi positivity was recorded for different categories of laboratory test and host species. Vector and host collection sites were geocoded and mapped. Ecological data associated with these sites were summarised. A further 145 articles encompassing general themes of scrub typhus ecology were reviewed. These topics range from the life-cycle to transmission, habitats, seasonality and human risks. Important gaps in our understanding are highlighted together with possible tools to begin to unravel these. Many of the data reported are highly variable and inconsistent and minimum data reporting standards are proposed. With more recent reports of human Orientia sp. infection in the Middle East and South America and enormous advances in research technology over recent decades, this comprehensive review provides a detailed summary of work investigating this pathogen in vectors and non-human hosts and updates current understanding of the complex ecology of scrub typhus. A better understanding of scrub typhus ecology has important relevance to ongoing research into improving diagnostics, developing vaccines and identifying useful public health interventions to reduce the burden of the disease.

"Individual variability is evident in behavior and physiology of animals. Determining whether behavior at intake may predict subsequent illness in the animal shelter may influence the management of dogs housed at animal shelters and reduce overall disease. While normally associated with mild disease and low mortality rates, respiratory disease nevertheless poses significant challenges to the management of dogs in the stressful environment of animal shelters due to its highly infectious nature. Therefore, the aim of the study was to explore whether behavior at intake can predict subsequent occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease in dogs at animal shelters. In a correlational study, 84 dogs were assessed throughout their stay at a city animal shelter. The dogs were subjected to a behavioral assessment, 1 min in-kennel behavioral observations across two observation periods, and the collection of urinary cortisol:creatinine (C:C) ratio. The occurrence and progression of upper respiratory disease was monitored through repeated clinical exams (rectal temperature and the occurrence of nasal and ocular discharge, and presence of coughing and sneezing). A basic PLS Path regression model revealed that time in the shelter (estimate = .53, p < .001), and sociability (estimate = .24, p < .001) and curiosity scores (estimate = .09, p = .026) were associated with increased illness. Activity and anxiety scores, however, were not associated with illness. Urinary C:C, taken on the first full day, did not predict subsequent illness when accounting for time. Limitations included attrition of dogs, a small percentage receiving vaccinations, and continuous and non-systematic rotation of dogs in the kennels. Understanding if behavior can predict subsequent illness may improve shelter management practices, and in turn, result in improved live-release outcomes.

"The invasive, human-biting Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, was detected in New Jersey in the eastern United States in August of 2017 and by November of 2018 this tick had been recorded from 45 counties across 9 states, primarily along the Eastern Seaboard. The establishment of H. longicornis in the United States has raised the questions of how commonly it will bite humans and which native pathogens may naturally infect this tick. There also is a need for experimental vector competence studies with native pathogens to determine if H. longicornis can acquire a given pathogen while feeding, pass it transstadially, and then transmit the pathogen in the next life stage. In this experimental study, we evaluated the vector competence of a population of H. longicornis originating from the United States (New York) for a native isolate (B31) of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). In agreement with a previous experimental study on the vector competence of H. longicornis for Borrelia garinii, we found that uninfected H. longicornis larvae could acquire B. burgdorferi s.s. while feeding on infected Mus musculus mice (infection prevalence >50% in freshly fed larvae) but that the infection was lost during the molt to the nymphal stage. None of 520 tested molted nymphs were found to be infected, indicating that transstadial passage of B. burgdorferi s.s. is absent or rare in H. longicornis; and based on the potential error associated with the number of nymphs testing negative in this study, we estimate that the upper 95% limit for infection prevalence was 0.73%. An Ixodes scapularis process control showed both effective acquisition of B. burgdorferi s.s. from infected mice by uninfected larvae and transstadial passage to the nymphal stage (infection prevalence of 80-82% for both freshly fed larvae and molted nymphs). We also observed that although H. longicornis larvae could be compelled to feed on mice by placing the ticks within feeding capsules, attachment and feeding success was minimal (<0.5%) when larvae were placed freely on the fur of the mice. We conclude that H. longicornis is unlikely to contribute more than minimally, if at all, to transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes in the United States.

"Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), caused by the bacteria Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is transmitted to humans by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) in eastern North America. To assess the emergence of A. phagocytophilum in Ontario, we analyzed patient serological and clinical data in combination with pathogen detection in blacklegged ticks from 2011 to 2017. Our sample population included all patients who had Anaplasma serological testing ordered by their physicians (n = 851). Eighty-three patients (10.8%) were A. phagocytophilum seropositive (IgG titers ≥ 1:64) and 686 (89.2%) were seronegative (IgG titers < 1:64). Applying published surveillance case definitions, we classified zero as confirmed, five as probable, and 78 as suspected cases. The percentage of seropositive patients remained generally stable at 13.6%. Seropositive patients were most often adult females, 40-59 years of age, and reported nonspecific signs and symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, and fever. Higher seropositivity rates (≥ 1.5 patients per 100,000 population) occurred in eastern and northwestern Ontario. The percentage of A. phagocytophilum-positive blacklegged ticks, through passive and active surveillance, was 0.4 and 1.1%, respectively, and increased over time. Serological and entomological indicators of A. phagocytophilum activity increased in areas of the province with established blacklegged tick populations. The risk of HGA is presently low in Ontario; however, further research is required to document the epidemiology of HGA in the province. To minimize the impact of HGA emergence in Ontario, increased awareness and education of the public and health-care providers is recommended, with consideration to making HGA a reportable infection in Ontario.

"BACKGROUND: Human granulocytic anaplasmosis, a tick-borne infection caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, has received scant attention, while scrub typhus, a mite-transmitted disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is the most common rickettsiosis in Taiwan. The clinical presentations of both diseases are characterized by undifferentiated fever, headache and malaise. Moreover, both pathogens have been detected in small mammals that serve as hosts for chiggers and ticks in the wild. The objective of the present study was to investigate whether human granulocytic anaplasmosis occurs in Taiwan. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Blood samples from 274 patients suspected of having scrub typhus in Kinmen, an offshore island of Taiwan, in 2011 and 2012 were retrospectively examined by immunofluorescence assays. IgG antibodies reactive with Anaplasma phagocytophilum was found in 31.8% (87/274) of the patients. Paired serology identified 3 patients with human granulocytic anaplasmosis and 8 patients with coinfection with O. tsutsugamushi and A. phagocytophilum. Laboratory tests showed that elevated serum ALT/AST, creatinine, and BUN levels were observed in patients with anaplasmosis and coinfection, but elevated serum CRP levels, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were only observed in coinfected patients. PCR detected A. phagocytophilum 16S rDNA and p44/msp2 in 2 patients. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the replicons of the 16S rDNA shared high sequence similarity with the reference sequences in the Korea, USA, Japan, and China. The amplicons of p44/msp2 were close to those of the human variants identified in the USA and Japan. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicated that A. phagocytophilum infection was prevalent but unrecognized in Taiwan.

"Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) are the vector for pathogens that cause more cases of human disease than any other arthropod. Lyme disease is the most common, caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner) in the northeastern United States. Further knowledge of seasonal effects on survival is important for management and modeling of both blacklegged ticks and tick-borne diseases. The focus of our study was on the impact of environmental factors on overwintering success of nymphal blacklegged ticks. In a three-year field study conducted in Connecticut and Maine, we determined that ground-level conditions play an important role in unfed nymphal overwintering survival. Ticks in plots where leaf litter and snow accumulation were unmanipulated had significantly greater survival compared to those where leaf litter was removed (p = 0.045) and where both leaf litter and snow were removed (p = 0.008). Additionally, we determined that the key overwintering predictors for nymphal blacklegged tick survival were the mean and mean minimum temperatures within a year. The findings of this research can be utilized in both small- and large-scale management of blacklegged ticks to potentially reduce the risk and occurrence of tick-borne diseases.

"Wild mustelids and canids are definitive hosts of Taenia and Versteria spp. while rodents act as natural intermediate hosts. Rarely, larval stages of these parasites can cause serious zoonoses. In Europe, four cases of Taenia martis cysticercosis have been diagnosed in immunocompetent women, and two cases in zoo primates since 2013. In North America, a zoonotic genotype related but distinct from Versteria mustelae has been identified in 2014, which had caused a fatal infection in an orangutan and liver- and disseminated cysticercoses in two severely immune deficient human patients in 2018, respectively. Additionally, we could attribute a historic human case from the USA to this Versteria sp. by reanalysing a published nucleotide sequence. In the last decades, sporadic zoonotic infections by cysticerci of the canid tapeworm Taenia crassiceps have been described (4 in North America, 8 in Europe). Besides, 3 ocular cases from North America and one neural infection from Europe, all in immunocompetent patients, 6 cutaneous infections were described in severely immunocompromised European patients. Correspondingly, besides oral infections with taeniid eggs, accidental subcutaneous oncosphere establishment after egg-contamination of open wounds was suggested, especially in cases with a history of cutaneous injuries at the infection site. Taenia multiceps is mainly transmitted in a domestic cycle. Only five human coenurosis cases are published since 2000. In contrast, T. serialis coenurosis (1 human case since 2000) is primarily transmitted by wild canids. The etiological diagnosis of exotic cysticercoses is challenging. Usually, clinical material does not allow for a morphological identification, and serological tests are not available. These limitations have partly been overcome by molecular tools. Without claiming any dramatic emergence of cysticercoses and coenuroses transmitted by wild carnivores, further sporadic cases of such 'exotic' infections have to be expected.

"Haemaphysalis longicornis, an invasive Ixodid tick, was recently reported in the eastern United States.

"Lyme borreliosis is the most common vector-borne zoonosis in the northern hemisphere, and the pathogens causing Lyme borreliosis have distinct, incompletely described transmission cycles involving multiple host groups. The mammal community in Fennoscandia differs from continental Europe, and we have limited data on potential competent and incompetent hosts of the different genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) at the northern distribution ranges where Lyme borreliosis is emerging. We used qPCR to determine presence of B. burgdorferi sl in tissue samples (ear) from 16 mammalian species and questing ticks from Norway, and we sequenced the 5S-23 S rDNA intergenic spacer region to determine genospecies from 1449 qPCR-positive isolates obtaining 423 sequences. All infections coming from small rodents and shrews were linked to the genospecies B. afzelii, while B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) was only found in red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris). Red squirrels were also infected with B. afzelii and B. garinii. There was no evidence of B. burgdorferi sl infection in moose (Alces alces), red deer (Cervus elaphus) or roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), confirming the role of cervids as incompetent hosts. In infected questing ticks in the two western counties, B. afzelii (67% and 75%) dominated over B. garinii (27% and 21%) and with only a few recorded B. burgdorferi ss and B. valaisiana. B. burgdorferi ss were more common in adult ticks than in nymphs, consistent with a reservoir in squirrels. Our study identifies potential competent hosts for the different genospecies, which is key to understand transmission cycles at high latitudes of Europe.

"Bioremediation is the degradation potential of microorganisms to dissimilate the complex chemical compounds from the surrounding environment. The genetics and biochemistry of biodegradation processes in datasets opened the way of systems biology. Systemic biology aid the study of interacting parts involved in the system. The significant keys of system biology are biodegradation network, computational biology, and omics approaches. Biodegradation network consists of all the databases and datasets which aid in assisting the degradation and deterioration potential of microorganisms for bioremediation processes. This review deciphers the bio-degradation network, i.e., the databases and datasets (UM-BBD, PAN, PTID, etc.) aiding in assisting the degradation and deterioration potential of microorganisms for bioremediation processes, computational biology and multi omics approaches like metagenomics, genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics for the efficient functional gene mining and their validation for bioremediation experiments. Besides, the present review also describes the gene editing tools like CRISPR Cas, TALEN, and ZFNs which can possibly make design microbe with functional gene of interest for degradation of particular recalcitrant for improved bioremediation.

"There are 17 human-biting ticks known in Australia. The bites of Ixodes holocyclus, Ornithodoros capensis, and Ornithodoros gurneyi can cause paralysis, inflammation, and severe local and systemic reactions in humans, respectively. Six ticks, including Amblyomma triguttatum, Bothriocroton hydrosauri, Haemaphysalis novaeguineae, Ixodes cornuatus, Ixodes holocyclus, and Ixodes tasmani may transmit Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia australis, Rickettsia honei, or Rickettsia honei subsp. marmionii. These bacterial pathogens cause Q fever, Queensland tick typhus (QTT), Flinders Island spotted fever (FISF), and Australian spotted fever (ASF). It is also believed that babesiosis can be transmitted by ticks to humans in Australia. In addition, Argas robertsi, Haemaphysalis bancrofti, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ixodes hirsti, Rhipicephalus australis, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks may play active roles in transmission of other pathogens that already exist or could potentially be introduced into Australia. These pathogens include Anaplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Burkholderia spp., Francisella spp., Dera Ghazi Khan virus (DGKV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Lake Clarendon virus (LCV), Saumarez Reef virus (SREV), Upolu virus (UPOV), or Vinegar Hill virus (VINHV). It is important to regularly update clinicians' knowledge about tick-borne infections because these bacteria and arboviruses are pathogens of humans that may cause fatal illness. An increase in the incidence of tick-borne infections of human may be observed in the future due to changes in demography, climate change, and increase in travel and shipments and even migratory patterns of birds or other animals. Moreover, the geographical conditions of Australia are favorable for many exotic ticks, which may become endemic to Australia given an opportunity. There are some human pathogens, such as Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia rickettsii that are not currently present in Australia, but can be transmitted by some human-biting ticks found in Australia, such as Rhipicephalus sanguineus, if they enter and establish in this country. Despite these threats, our knowledge of Australian ticks and tick-borne diseases is in its infancy.

"BACKGROUND: The emergence of different viral infections during the last decades like dengue, West Nile, SARS, chikungunya, MERS-CoV, Ebola, Zika and Yellow Fever raised some questions on quickness and reliability of laboratory diagnostic tests for verification of suspected cases. Since sampling of blood requires medically trained personal and comprises some risks for the patient as well as for the health care personal, the sampling by non-invasive methods (e.g. saliva and/ or urine) might be a very valuable alternative for investigating a diseased patient. MAIN BODY: To analyse the usefulness of alternative non-invasive samples for the diagnosis of emerging infectious viral diseases, a literature search was performed on PubMed for alternative sampling for these viral infections. In total, 711 papers of potential relevance were found, of which we have included 128 in this review. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the experience using non-invasive sampling for the diagnostic of emerging viral diseases, it seems important to perform an investigation using alternative samples for routine diagnostics. Moreover, during an outbreak situation, evaluation of appropriate sampling and further processing for laboratory analysis on various diagnostic platforms are very crucial. This will help to achieve optimal diagnostic results for a good and reliable case identification.

"Urbanisation and climate change are altering the pattern of California serogroup viruses in North America. As La Crosse virus (LACV) is the most pathogenic of the California serogroup, it is important to identify changes in distribution, transmission and pathogenesis. A scoping review (ScR) was prioritised to summarise the global evidence on LACV. A comprehensive search strategy was used, identified references were screened for relevance and relevant articles were characterised. Each step was conducted by two independent reviewers using pre-tested forms. Analysis identified areas of research saturation and gaps. The ScR included 481 research articles that were mostly journal articles (78.2%) conducted in North America (90.9%) from 1969 to 2016. Most evidence focused on epidemiology (44.9%), virus characteristics (25.8%), transmission conditions (18.7%) and pathogenesis of LACV in hosts (18.3%). Fewer studies evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic tests (8.7%), the efficacy of treatments (3.5%), prevention and control strategies (3.1%), the economic burden of infection (0.6%) and social impact (0.2%) of LACV. None of the literature predicted the impact of climate change on LACV, nor were any cases reported in Canada. These findings are intended to guide research to close knowledge gaps and inform evidence-based decisions surrounding activities for the prevention and control of LACV.

"Natural history museums and the specimen collections they curate are vital scientific infrastructure, a fact as true today as it was when biologists began collecting and preserving specimens over 200 years ago. The importance of museum specimens in studies of taxonomy, systematics, ecology and evolutionary biology is evidenced by a rich and abundant literature, yet creative and novel uses of specimens are constantly broadening the impact of natural history collections on biodiversity science and global sustainability. Excellent examples of the critical importance of specimens come from their use in documenting the consequences of environmental change, which is particularly relevant considering the alarming rate at which we now modify our planet in the Anthropocene. In this review, we highlight the important role of bird, mammal and amphibian specimens in documenting the Anthropocene and provide examples that underscore the need for continued collection of museum specimens.This article is part of the theme issue 'Biological collections for understanding biodiversity in the Anthropocene'.

"An inverse relationship between biodiversity and human health has been termed the 'dilution effect' paradigm. In the case of tick-borne infections such as Lyme disease, the key assumption is that Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato abundance is increased by the loss of less competent (dilution) hosts as biodiversity declines. White-tailed deer play a dual role in the pathogen cycle, as key reproductive hosts for adult ticks and incompetent hosts for the pathogen. While the role of deer as hosts of adult ticks is well established, the extent to which deer also feed immature ticks and reduce the proportion infected is unknown because of logistic constraints in measuring this empirically. We estimated the proportion of larvae that fed on deer in an extremely species-poor community on Block Island, RI, where tick nymphal infection prevalence was found to be lower than expected. In 2014, we measured the density, larval tick burdens, and realized reservoir competence of small mammal and bird hosts on Block Island, RI. In 2015, we measured the infection prevalence of host-seeking Ixodes scapularis nymphs resulting from larvae fed on available hosts in 2014. We back-estimated the proportion of larvae expected to have fed on deer in 2014 (the only unknown parameter) to result in the nymphal infection prevalence observed in 2015. Back-estimation predicted that 29% of larval ticks must have fed on deer to yield the observed 30% nymphal infection prevalence. In comparison, the proportion of larvae feeding on mice was 44% and 27% on birds. Our study identified an influential role of deer in reducing nymphal tick infection prevalence and a potential role as dilution hosts if the reduction in nymphal infection prevalence outweighs the role of deer as tick population amplifiers. Because both deer and competent hosts may increase in anthropogenic, fragmented habitats, the links between fragmentation, biodiversity, and Lyme disease risk may be complex and difficult to predict. Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship between deer abundance and Lyme disease risk would reduce the efficacy of deer population reduction efforts to control Lyme disease.

"The impact of a pathogen on the fitness and behaviour of its natural host depends upon the host-parasite relationship in a given set of environmental conditions. Here, we experimentally investigated the effects of Borrelia afzelii, one of the aetiological agents of Lyme disease in humans, on the fitness of its natural rodent host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), in semi-natural conditions with two contrasting host population densities. Our results show that B. afzelii can modify the reproductive success and spacing behaviour of its rodent host, whereas host survival was not affected. Infection impaired the breeding probability of large bank voles. Reproduction was hastened in infected females without alteration of the offspring size at birth. At low density, infected males produced fewer offspring, fertilized fewer females and had lower mobility than uninfected individuals. Meanwhile, the infection did not affect the proportion of offspring produced or the proportion of mating partner in female bank voles. Our study is the first to show that B. afzelii infection alters the reproductive success of the natural host. The effects observed could reflect the sickness behaviour due to the infection or they could be a consequence of a manipulation of the host behaviour by the bacteria.

"BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium spp. and Enterocytozoon bieneusi are prevalent zoonotic pathogens responsible for the high burden of diarrheal diseases worldwide. Rodents are globally overpopulated and are known as reservoirs or carriers of a variety of zoonotic pathogens including Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi. However, few data are available on genetic characterizations of both pathogens in rodents in China. The aim of the present work was to determine the prevalence and genetic characterizations of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi in brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) from Heilongjiang, China. METHODS: A total of 242 wild brown rats were captured in Heilongjiang Province of China. A fresh fecal specimen was collected directly from the intestinal and rectal content of each brown rat. All the fecal specimens were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi by PCR and sequencing of the partial small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene of the two pathogens, respectively. RESULTS: The infection rate was 9.1% (22/242) for Cryptosporidium spp. and 7.9% (19/242) for E. bieneusi. Sequence analysis confirmed the presence of C. ubiquitum (1/22, 4.5%) and three genotypes of Cryptosporidium, including Cryptosporidium rat genotype I (14/22, 63.6%), Cryptosporidium rat genotype IV (6/22, 27.3%) and Cryptosporidium suis-like genotype (1/22, 4.5%). Meanwhile, two E. bieneusi genotypes were identified, including D (17/19, 89.5%) and Peru6 (2/19, 10.5%). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotype Peru6 was identified in rodents for the first time globally and Cryptosporidium rat genotype I and Cryptosporidium rat genotype IV were found in rats in China for the first time. The finding of zoonotic C. ubiquitum and C. suis-like genotype, as well as E. bieneusi genotypes, suggests that brown rats pose a threat to human health. It is necessary to control brown rat population in the investigated areas and improve local people's awareness of the transmission risk of the two pathogens from brown rats to humans.

"Most emerging infectious diseases of humans are transmitted to humans from other animals. The transmission of these ""zoonotic"" pathogens is affected by the abundance and behavior of their wildlife hosts. However, the effects of infection with zoonotic pathogens on behavior of wildlife hosts, particularly those that might propagate through ecological communities, are not well understood. Borrelia burgdorferi is a bacterium that causes Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne disease in the USA and Europe. In its North American range, the pathogen is most frequently transmitted among hosts through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). Using sham and true vaccines, we experimentally manipulated infection load with this zoonotic pathogen in its most competent wildlife reservoir host, the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, and quantified the effects of infection on mouse foraging behavior, as well as levels of mouse infestation with ticks. Mice treated with the true vaccine had 20% fewer larval blacklegged ticks infesting them compared to mice treated with the sham vaccine, a significant difference. We observed a nonsignificant trend for mice treated with the true vaccine to be more likely to visit experimental foraging trays (20%-30% effect size) and to prey on gypsy moth pupae (5%-20% effect size) compared to mice treated with the sham vaccine. We observed no difference between mice on true- versus sham-vaccinated grids in risk-averse foraging. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen appears to elicit behavioral changes that might reduce self-grooming, but other behaviors were affected subtly or not at all. High titers of B. burgdorferi in mice could elicit a self-reinforcing feedback loop in which reduced grooming increases tick burdens and hence exposure to tick-borne pathogens.

"The effects of light on cognitive function have been well-documented in human studies, with brighter illumination improving cognitive performance in school children, healthy adults, and patients in early stages of dementia. However, the underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. The present study examined how ambient light affects hippocampal function using the diurnal Nile grass rats (Arvicanthis niloticus) as the animal model. Grass rats were housed in either a 12:12 h bright light-dark (brLD, 1,000 lux) or dim light-dark (dimLD, 50 lux) cycle. After 4 weeks, the dimLD group showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. The impairment in their MWM performance were reversed when the dimLD group were transferred to the brLD condition for another 4 weeks. The results suggest that lighting conditions influence cognitive function of grass rats in a way similar to that observed in humans, such that bright light is beneficial over dim light for cognitive performance. In addition to the behavioral changes, grass rats in the dimLD condition exhibited reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus, most notably in the CA1 subregion. There was also a reduction in dendritic spine density in CA1 apical dendrites in dimLD as compared to the brLD group, and the reduction was mostly in the number of mushroom and stubby spines. When dimLD animals were transferred to the brLD condition for 4 weeks, the hippocampal BDNF and dendritic spine density significantly increased. The results illustrate that not only does light intensity affect cognitive performance, but that it also impacts hippocampal structural plasticity. These studies serve as a starting point to further understand how ambient light modulates neuronal and cognitive functions in diurnal species. A mechanistic understanding of the effects of light on cognition can help to identify risk factors for cognitive decline and contribute to the development of more effective prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment in clinical populations.

"Anopheles female mosquitoes can transmit Plasmodium, the malaria parasite. During their aquatic life, wild Anopheles mosquito larvae are exposed to a huge diversity of microbes present in their breeding sites. Later, adult females often take successive blood meals that might also carry different micro-organisms, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. Therefore, prior to Plasmodium ingestion, the mosquito biology could be modulated at different life stages by a suite of microbes present in larval breeding sites, as well as in the adult environment. In this article, we highlight several naturally relevant scenarios of Anopheles microbial pre-exposure that we assume might impact mosquito vectorial competence for the malaria parasite: (i) larval microbial exposures; (ii) protist co-infections; (iii) virus co-infections; and (iv) pathogenic bacteria co-infections. In addition, significant behavioral changes in African Anopheles vectors have been associated with increasing insecticide resistance. We discuss how these ethological modifications may also increase the repertoire of microbes to which mosquitoes could be exposed, and that might also influence their vectorial competence. Studying Plasmodium-Anopheles interactions in natural microbial environments would efficiently contribute to refining the transmission risks.

"Tick-borne relapsing fever in western North America is a zoonosis caused by the spirochete bacterium, Borrelia hermsii, which is transmitted by the bite of infected Ornithodoros hermsi ticks. The pathogen is maintained in natural cycles involving small rodent hosts such as chipmunks and tree squirrels, as well as the tick vector. In order for these ticks to establish sustained and viable populations, a narrow set of environmental parameters must exist, primarily moderate temperatures and moderate to high amounts of precipitation. Maximum Entropy Species Distribution Modeling (Maxent) was used to predict the species distribution of O. hermsi and B. hermsii through time and space based on current climatic trends and future projected climate changes. From this modeling process, we found that the projected current distributions of both the tick and spirochete align with known endemic foci for the disease. Further, global climate models predict a shift in the distribution of suitable habitat for the tick vector to higher elevations. Our predictions are useful for targeting surveillance efforts in areas of high risk in western North America, increasing the efficiency and accuracy of public health investigations and vector control efforts.

"Coping styles in response to stressors have been described both in humans and in other animal species. Because coping styles are directly related to individual fitness they are part of the life history strategy. Behavioral styles trade off with other life-history traits through the acquisition and allocation of resources. Domestication and subsequent artificial selection for production traits specifically focused on selection of individuals with energy sparing mechanisms for non-production traits. Domestication resulted in animals with low levels of aggression and activity, and a low hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity. In the present work, we propose that, vice versa, selection for improved production efficiency may to some extent continue to favor docile domesticated phenotypes. It is hypothesized that both domestication and selection for improved production efficiency may result in the selection of reactive style animals. Both domesticated and reactive style animals are characterized by low levels of aggression and activity, and increased serotonin neurotransmitter levels. However, whereas domestication quite consistently results in a decrease in the functional state of the HPA axis, the reactive coping style is often found to be dominated by a high HPA response. This may suggest that fearfulness and coping behavior are two independent underlying dimensions to the coping response. Although it is generally proposed that animal welfare improves with selection for calmer animals that are less fearful and reactive to novelty, animals bred to be less sensitive with fewer desires may be undesirable from an ethical point of view.

"Exploration and activity are often described as trade-offs between the fitness benefits of gathering information and resources, and the potential costs of increasing exposure to predators and parasites. More exploratory individuals are predicted to have higher rates of parasitism, but this relationship has rarely been examined for virus infections in wild populations. Here, we used the multimammate mouse Mastomys natalensis to investigate the relationship between exploration, activity, and infection with Morogoro virus (MORV). We characterized individual exploratory behavior (open field and novel object tests) and activity (trap diversity), and quantified the relationship between these traits and infection status using linear regression. We found that M. natalensis expresses consistent individual differences, or personality types, in exploratory behavior (repeatability of 0.30, 95% CI: 0.21-0.36). In addition, we found a significant contrasting effect of age on exploration and activity where juveniles display higher exploration levels than adults, but lower field-activity. There was however no statistical evidence for a behavioral syndrome between these 2 traits. Contrary to our expectations, we found no correlation between MORV infection status and exploratory behavior or activity, which suggests that these behaviors may not increase exposure probability to MORV infection. This would further imply that variation in viral infection between individuals is not affected by between-individual variation in exploration and activity.

"West Nile fever (WNF) has been assessed according to the criteria of the Animal Health Law (AHL), in particular criteria of Article 7 on disease profile and impacts, Article 5 on the eligibility of WNF to be listed, Article 9 for the categorisation of WNF according to disease prevention and control rules as in Annex IV and Article 8 on the list of animal species related to WNF. The assessment has been performed following a methodology composed of information collection and compilation, expert judgement on each criterion at individual and, if no consensus was reached before, also at collective level. The output is composed of the categorical answer, and for the questions where no consensus was reached, the different supporting views are reported. Details on the methodology used for this assessment are explained in a separate opinion. According to the assessment performed, WNF can be considered eligible to be listed for Union intervention as laid down in Article 5(3) of the AHL. The disease would comply with the criteria as in Sections 2 and 5 of Annex IV of the AHL, for the application of the disease prevention and control rules referred to in points (b) and (e) of Article 9(1). The animal species to be listed for WNF according to Article 8(3) criteria are several orders of birds and mammals as susceptible species and several families of birds as reservoir. Different mosquito species can serve as vectors.

"Powassan virus (POWV, Flaviviridae) is the only North American member of the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses. It is transmitted to small- and medium-sized mammals by Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes cookei, and several other Ixodes tick species. Humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50% of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958 when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, and POWV was isolated from the brain autopsy of this case. Two distinct genetic lineages of POWV are now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and deer tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. In the past 5 years, both basic and applied research for POWV disease has intensified, including phylogenetic studies, field surveillance, case studies, and animal model development. This review provides an overview of POWV, including the epidemiology, transmission, clinical disease, and diagnosis of POWV infection. Recent research developments and future priorities with regard to the disease are emphasized.

"Landscape change and altered host abundance are major drivers of zoonotic pathogen emergence. Conservation and biodiversity management of landscapes and vertebrate communities can have secondary effects on vector-borne pathogen transmission that are important to assess. Here we review the potential implications of these activities on the risk of Lyme borreliosis in the United Kingdom. Conservation management activities include woodland expansion, management and restoration, deer management, urban greening and the release and culling of non-native species. Available evidence suggests that increasing woodland extent, implementing biodiversity policies that encourage ecotonal habitat and urban greening can increase the risk of Lyme borreliosis by increasing suitable habitat for hosts and the tick vectors. However, this can depend on whether deer population management is carried out as part of these conservation activities. Exclusion fencing or culling deer to low densities can decrease tick abundance and Lyme borreliosis risk. As management actions often constitute large-scale perturbation experiments, these hold great potential to understand underlying drivers of tick and pathogen dynamics. We recommend integrating monitoring of ticks and the risk of tick-borne pathogens with conservation management activities. This would help fill knowledge gaps and the production of best practice guidelines to reduce risks.This article is part of the themed issue 'Conservation, biodiversity and infectious disease: scientific evidence and policy implications'.

"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne pathogens pose an increasing threat to human and veterinary health across the northern hemisphere. While the seasonal activity of ticks is largely determined by climatic conditions, host-population dynamics are also likely to affect tick abundance. Consequently, abundance fluctuations of rodents in northern Europe are expected to be translated into tick dynamics, and can hence potentially affect the circulation of tick-borne pathogens. We quantified and explained the temporal dynamics of the tick Ixodes ricinus in the northernmost part of its European geographical range, by estimating (i) abundance in vegetation and (ii) infestation load in the most common rodent species in the study area, the bank vole Myodes glareolus. RESULTS: Ixodes ricinus nymphs and adult females, the life stages responsible for the most of tick bites in humans, peaked in May-June and August-September. Larvae and nymphs were simultaneously active in June and abundance of questing larvae and nymphs in the vegetation showed a positive association with bank vole abundance. Moreover, infesting larvae and nymphs were aggregated on bank voles, and the infestation of bank voles with I. ricinus larvae and nymphs was positively associated with bank vole abundance. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate early summer and early autumn as periods of increased risk for humans to encounter I. ricinus ticks in boreal urban forests and suggest a 2 years life-cycle for I. ricinus with two cohorts of ticks during the same year. Moreover, we identified a simultaneous activity of larvae and nymphs which allows co-feeding on the rodent host, which in turn supports the transmission of several important zoonotic tick-borne pathogens. Finally, we showed that a high density of the rodent host may enhance the risk that ticks and, potentially, tick-borne pathogens pose to human health.

"The Old World bollworm Helicoverpa armigera is now established in Brazil but efforts to identify incursion origin(s) and pathway(s) have met with limited success due to the patchiness of available data. Using international agricultural/horticultural commodity trade data and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene markers, we inferred the origins and incursion pathways into Brazil. We detected 20 mtDNA haplotypes from six Brazilian states, eight of which were new to our 97 global COI-Cyt b haplotype database. Direct sequence matches indicated five Brazilian haplotypes had Asian, African, and European origins. We identified 45 parsimoniously informative sites and multiple substitutions per site within the concatenated (945 bp) nucleotide dataset, implying that probabilistic phylogenetic analysis methods are needed. High diversity and signatures of uniquely shared haplotypes with diverse localities combined with the trade data suggested multiple incursions and introduction origins in Brazil. Increasing agricultural/horticultural trade activities between the Old and New Worlds represents a significant biosecurity risk factor. Identifying pest origins will enable resistance profiling that reflects countries of origin to be included when developing a resistance management strategy, while identifying incursion pathways will improve biosecurity protocols and risk analysis at biosecurity hotspots including national ports.

"Research on deep hibernators almost exclusively uses species captured from the wild or from local breeding. An exception is Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus), the only standard laboratory animal showing deep hibernation. In deep hibernators, several factors influence hibernation quality, including body mass, sex and diet. We examined hibernation quality in commercially obtained Syrian hamsters in relation to body mass, sex and a diet enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids. Animals (M/F:30/30, 12 weeks of age) were obtained from Harlan (IN, USA) and individually housed at 21 °C and L:D 14:10 until 20 weeks of age, followed by L:D 8:16 until 27 weeks. Then conditions were changed to 5 °C and L:D 0:24 for 9 weeks to induce hibernation. Movement was continuously monitored with passive infrared detectors. Hamsters were randomized to control diet or a diet 3× enriched in linoleic acid from 16 weeks of age. Hamsters showed a high rate of premature death (n = 24, 40%), both in animals that did and did not initiate torpor, which was unrelated to body weight, sex and diet. Time to death (31.7 ± 3.1 days, n = 12) or time to first torpor bout (36.6 ± 1.6 days, n = 12) was similar in prematurely deceased hamsters. Timing of induction of hibernation and duration of torpor and arousal was unaffected by body weight, sex or diet. Thus, commercially obtained Syrian hamsters subjected to winter conditions showed poor survival, irrespective of body weight, sex and diet. These factors also did not affect hibernation parameters. Possibly, long-term commercial breeding from a confined genetic background has selected against the hibernation trait.

"Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex is capable of establishing persistent infections in a wide variety of species, particularly rodents. Infection is asymptomatic or mild in most reservoir host species, indicating successful co-evolution of the pathogen with its natural hosts. However, infected humans and other incidental hosts can develop Lyme disease, a serious inflammatory syndrome characterized by tissue inflammation of joints, heart, muscles, skin, and CNS. Although B. burgdorferi infection induces both innate and adaptive immune responses, they are ultimately ineffective in clearing the infection from reservoir hosts, leading to bacterial persistence. Here, we review some mechanisms by which B. burgdorferi evades the immune system of the rodent host, focusing in particular on the effects of innate immune mechanisms and recent findings suggesting that T-dependent B cell responses are subverted during infection. A better understanding of the mechanisms causing persistence in rodents may help to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and ultimately aid in the development of therapies that support effective clearance of the bacterial infection by the host's immune system.

"We document the presence of blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, in the Grand River valley, Centre Wellington, Ontario. Overall, 15 (36%) of 42 I. scapularis adults collected from 41 mammalian hosts (dogs, cats, humans) were positive for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.). Using real-time PCR testing and DNA sequencing of the flagellin (fla) gene, we determined that Borrelia amplicons extracted from I. scapularis adults belonged to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), which is pathogenic to humans and certain domestic animals. Based on the distribution of I. scapularis adults within the river basin, it appears likely that migratory birds provide an annual influx of I. scapularis immatures during northward spring migration. Health-care providers need to be aware that local residents can present with Lyme disease symptoms anytime during the year.

"BACKGROUND: The Ehrlichia muris-like agent (EMLA) is a newly recognized human pathogen in the North Central United States. Although blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) have been identified as capable vectors, wild reservoirs have not yet been established for EMLA. As key hosts for I. scapularis, white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) are important reservoirs for various tick-borne pathogens, and potentially, for EMLA. The objective of this study was to evaluate reservoir competence in P. leucopus using a natural vector. RESULTS: Mice acquired EMLA infection from feeding ticks and were able to transmit infection to naïve ticks. Transmission between simultaneously feeding tick life stages was also demonstrated. Infections in mice were acute and severe, with systemic dissemination. Limited host survival and clearance of infection among survivors resulted in a narrow interval where EMLA could be acquired by feeding ticks. CONCLUSIONS: Peromyscus leucopus is a competent reservoir of EMLA and likely to play a role in its enzootic transmission cycle. The duration and severity of EMLA infection in these hosts suggests that tick phenology is a critical factor determining the geographic distribution of EMLA in North America.

"Lyme disease is a major vector-borne bacterial disease in the USA. The disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, and transmitted among hosts and humans, primarily by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). The ~25 B. burgdorferi genotypes, based on genotypic variation of their outer surface protein C (ospC), can be phenotypically separated as strains that primarily cause human diseases-human invasive strains (HIS)-or those that rarely do. Additionally, the genotypes are non-randomly associated with host species. The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which phenotypic outcomes of B. burgdorferi could be explained by the host communities fed upon by blacklegged ticks. In 2006 and 2009, we determined the host community composition based on abundance estimates of the vertebrate hosts, and collected host-seeking nymphal ticks in 2007 and 2010 to determine the ospC genotypes within infected ticks. We regressed instances of B. burgdorferi phenotypes on site-specific characteristics of host communities by constructing Bayesian hierarchical models that properly handled missing data. The models provided quantitative support for the relevance of host composition on Lyme disease risk pertaining to B. burgdorferi prevalence (i.e. overall nymphal infection prevalence, or NIPAll) and HIS prevalence among the infected ticks (NIPHIS). In each year, NIPAll and NIPHIS was found to be associated with host relative abundances and diversity. For mice and chipmunks, the association with NIPAll was positive, but tended to be negative with NIPHIS in both years. However, the direction of association between shrew relative abundance with NIPAll or NIPHIS differed across the two years. And, diversity (H') had a negative association with NIPAll, but positive association with NIPHIS in both years. Our analyses highlight that the relationships between the relative abundances of three primary hosts and the community diversity with NIPAll, and NIPHIS, are variable in time and space, and that disease risk inference, based on the role of host community, changes when we examine risk overall or at the phenotypic level. Our discussion focuses on the observed relationships between prevalence and host community characteristics and how they substantiate the ecological understanding of phenotypic Lyme disease risk.

"Numerous studies have demonstrated earlier timing of spring migration and egg-laying in small passerines, but documentation of such responses to recent climate change in the life histories of higher trophic feeding birds such as raptors is relatively scarce. Raptors may be particularly susceptible to possible adverse effects of climate change due to their longer generation turnover times and lower reproductive capacity, which could lead to population declines because of an inability to match reproductive timing with optimal brood rearing conditions. Conversely adaptively favorable outcomes due to the influence of changing climate may occur. In general, birds that seasonally nest earlier typically have higher reproductive output compared to conspecifics that nest later in the season. Given the strong seasonal decline in reproductive output, and the heritability of nesting phenology, it is possible that nesting seasons would (adaptively) advance over time. Recent climate warming may release prior ecological constraints on birds that depend on food availability at the time of egg production, as do various raptors including Cooper's Hawks (Accipiter cooperii). Under this scenario, productivity, especially clutch size, might increase because it is likely that this reproductive demographic may be the most immediate response to the earlier seasonal presence of food resources. We demonstrated a statistically significant shift of about 4-5 days to an earlier timing of egg-hatching in spring across 36 years during 1980-2015 for a partially migratory population of Cooper's Hawks in Wisconsin, United States, which is consistent with a recent study that showed that Cooper's Hawks had advanced their timing of spring migration during 1979-2012. Both studies occurred in the Great Lakes region, an area that compared to global averages is experiencing earlier and increased warming particularly in the spring in Wisconsin. The nesting period did not lengthen. We suggest that the gradual shift of six consecutive generations of hawks was likely in response to recent climate change or warming. We did not detect any long-term temporal change in average clutch or brood sizes. However, such indices of reproduction are among the highest known for the species and thus may be at their physio-ecological maximum for this population. Our study population appears to show resilience to and does not appear to be adversely influenced by the recent rate of changing climate at this time.

"Stress hormones (glucocorticoids), incorporated into hair/fur and faeces, have been proposed as biomarkers of overall health in wildlife. Although such biomarkers may be helpful for wildlife conservation and management, their use has rarely been validated. There is a paucity of studies examining the variation of stress hormones in mammals and how they relate to other health measures, such as parasitism. Parasites are ubiquitous in wildlife and can influence the fitness of individual animals and populations. Through a longitudinal experiment using captive reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), we tested whether animals infected with Ostertagia gruehneri, a gastrointestinal nematode with negative impacts on fitness of the host, had higher stress levels compared with those that had been treated to remove infection. Faecal samples were collected weekly for 12 weeks (June-September) and hair was collected at the start and end of the study; glucocorticoids were quantified using enzyme immunoassays. Contrary to what was expected, infected reindeer had similar levels of cortisol in hair and slightly lower glucocorticoid metabolites in faeces compared with uninfected reindeer. Faecal corticosterone levels were higher than faecal cortisol levels, and only corticosterone increased significantly after a handling event. These results suggest that reindeer may use a tolerance strategy to cope with gastrointestinal nematodes and raise the question as to whether moderate infection intensities with nematodes are beneficial to the host. By removing nematodes we may have altered the gut microbiota, leading to the observed elevated faecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels in the treated reindeer. These findings demonstrate the importance of considering both cortisol and corticosterone in physiological studies, as there is mounting evidence that they may have different functionalities.

"A field trial was conducted on residential properties in a Lyme disease endemic area of New Jersey to determine the efficacy of Maxforce Tick Management System (TMS) bait boxes modified with doxycycline hyclate-laden bait to reduce the acarological risk of Lyme disease and the utility of galvanized steel shrouds to protect the bait boxes from squirrel depredation and ability to routinely service these devices. The strategy began with a 9-wk deployment against larvae followed by a 17-wk deployment against nymphs and larvae the second year. Passive application of fipronil reduced nymphal and larval tick burdens on small mammals by 76 and 77%, respectively, and nymphal tick abundance by 81% on treated properties. In addition, the percentage of infected small mammals recovered from intervention areas following treatment was reduced by 96% for Borrelia burgdorferi and 93% for Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Infection prevalence in host-seeking nymphal ticks for both B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum were reduced by 93 and 61%, respectively. Results indicate that Maxforce TMS bait boxes fitted with doxycycline-impregnated bait is an effective means of reducing ticks and infection prevalence for B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in both rodent reservoirs and questing Ixodes scapularis Say ticks. The protective shroud allows the device to be routinely serviced and protect against squirrel depredation.

"In August 2015, plague was diagnosed for 2 persons who had visited Yosemite National Park in California, USA. One case was septicemic and the other bubonic. Subsequent environmental investigation identified probable locations of exposure for each patient and evidence of epizootic plague in other areas of the park. Transmission of Yersinia pestis was detected by testing rodent serum, fleas, and rodent carcasses. The environmental investigation and whole-genome multilocus sequence typing of Y. pestis isolates from the patients and environmental samples indicated that the patients had been exposed in different locations and that at least 2 distinct strains of Y. pestis were circulating among vector-host populations in the area. Public education efforts and insecticide applications in select areas to control rodent fleas probably reduced the risk for plague transmission to park visitors and staff.

"West Nile fever (WNF) is a zoonotic disease, occurring nearly globally. In Madagascar, West Nile virus (WNV) was first detected in 1978 from wild birds and the virus is currently distributed across the island, but no epidemic or epizootic period has been recorded. One fatal human case of WNV infection was reported in 2011, suggesting a ""tip of the iceberg"" phenomenon of a possible WNF epidemic/epizootic on the island. The main objective of this literature-based survey is to review patterns of WNV circulation in Madagascar from the entomological and ornithological points of view. Among the 235 mosquito species described from Madagascar, 29 species are widely associated with WNV infection; 16 of them are found naturally infected with WNV on the island and categorized into major, candidate, and potential vectors of WNV according to their vector capacity. This study upholds the hypothesis that WNV enzooticity is independent of annual movements of migratory birds passing through Madagascar. Moreover, the lack of regular migratory bird flux between Africa and Madagascar would reduce the probability of transmission and the subsequent reintroduction of the virus into locally occurring mosquito species. Given that Palearctic migratory birds are strongly implicated in the transmission of WNV, we highlight notable differences in the movements and species diversity of these birds in Madagascar as compared to eastern and northern Africa. Risk factors from this two-pronged approach are presented for the emergence of WNF outbreak.

"La Crosse encephalitis is a viral disease that has emerged in new locations across the Appalachian region of the United States. Conventional wisdom suggests that ongoing emergence of La Crosse virus (LACV) could stem from the invasive Asian tiger (Aedes albopictus) mosquito. Efforts to prove this, however, are complicated by the numerous transmission routes and species interactions involved in LACV dynamics. To analyze LACV transmission by Asian tiger mosquitoes, we constructed epidemiologic models. These models accurately predict empirical infection rates. They do not, however, support the hypothesis that Asian tiger mosquitoes are responsible for the recent emergence of LACV at new foci. Consequently, we conclude that other factors, including different invasive mosquitoes, changes in climate variables, or changes in wildlife densities, should be considered as alternative explanations for recent increases in La Crosse encephalitis.

"We document an established population of blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, on Corkscrew Island, Kenora District, Ontario, Canada. Primers of the outer surface protein A (OspA) gene, the flagellin (fla) gene, and the flagellin B (flaB) gene were used in the PCR assays to detect Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), the Lyme disease bacterium. In all, 60 (73%) of 82 adult I. scapularis, were infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. As well, 6 (43%) of 14 unfed I. scapularis nymphs were positive for B. burgdorferi s.l. An I. scapularis larva was also collected from a deer mouse, and several unfed larvae were gathered by flagging leaf litter. Based on DNA sequencing of randomly selected Borrelia amplicons from six nymphal and adult I. scapularis ticks, primers for the flagellin (fla) and flagellin B (flaB) genes reveal the presence of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), a genospecies pathogenic to humans and certain domestic animals. We collected all 3 host-feeding life stages of I. scapularis in a single year, and report the northernmost established population of I. scapularis in Ontario. Corkscrew Island is hyperendemic for Lyme disease and has the highest prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. for any established population in Canada. Because of this very high infection prevalence, this population of I. scapularis has likely been established for decades. Of epidemiological significance, cottage owners, island visitors, outdoors enthusiasts, and medical professionals must be vigilant that B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected I. scapularis on Corkscrew Island pose a serious public health risk.

"Among-individual differences in behavior are now a widely studied research-focus within the field of behavioral ecology. Furthermore, elements of an animal's internal state, such as energy or fat reserves, and infection status can have large impacts on behaviors. Despite this, we still know little regarding how state may affect behavioral variation. Recent exposure to pathogens may have a particularly large impact on behavioral expression given that it likely activates costly immune pathways, potentially forcing organism to make behavioral tradeoffs. In this study we investigate how recent exposure to a common bacterial pathogen, Serratia marcescens, affects both the mean behavioral expression and the among-individual differences (i.e. variation) in boldness behavior in the field cricket, Gryllus integer. We find that recent pathogen exposure does not affect mean behavioral expression of the treatment groups, but instead affects behavioral variation and repeatability. Specifically, bacterial exposure drove large among-individual variation, resulting in high levels of repeatability in some aspects of boldness (willingness to emerge into a novel environment), but not others (latency to become active in novel environment), compared to non-infected crickets. Interestingly, sham injection resulted in a universal lack of among-individual differences. Our results highlight the sensitivity of among-individual variance and repeatability estimates to ecological and environmental factors that individuals face throughout their lives.

"Immunity is at the core of major theories related to invasion biology. Among them, the evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) and EICA-refined hypotheses have been used as a reference work. They postulate that the release from pathogens often experienced during invasion should favour a reallocation of resources from (costly) immune defences to beneficial life-history traits associated with invasive potential. We review studies documenting immune changes during animal invasions. We describe the designs and approaches that have been applied and discuss some reasons that prevent drawing generalized conclusions regarding EICA hypotheses. We detail why a better assessment of invasion history and immune costs, including immunopathologies and parasite communities, could improve our understanding of the relationships between immunity and invasion success. Finally, we propose new perspectives to revisit the EICA hypotheses. We first emphasize the neutral and adaptive mechanisms involved in immune changes, as well as timing of the later. Such investigation will help decipher whether immune changes are a consequence of pre-adaptation, or the result of postintroduction adaptations to invasion front conditions. We next bring attention to new avenues of research that remain unexplored, namely age-dependent immunity and gut microbiota, potential key factors underlying adaptation to invasion front environment and modulating invasion success.

"One hundred and fifty years ago Max Schultze first proposed the duplex theory of vision, that vertebrate eyes have two types of photoreceptor cells with differing sensitivity: rods for dim light and cones for bright light and colour detection. We now know that this division is fundamental not only to the photoreceptors themselves but to the whole of retinal and visual processing. But why are rods more sensitive, and how did the duplex retina first evolve? Cells resembling cones are very old, first appearing among cnidarians; the emergence of rods was a key step in the evolution of the vertebrate eye. Many transduction proteins have different isoforms in rods and cones, and others are expressed at different levels. Moreover rods and cones have a different anatomy, with only rods containing membranous discs enclosed by the plasma membrane. These differences must be responsible for the difference in absolute sensitivity, but which are essential? Recent research particularly expressing cone proteins in rods or changing the level of expression seem to show that many of the molecular differences in the activation and decay of the response may have each made a small contribution as evolution proceeded stepwise with incremental increases in sensitivity. Rod outer-segment discs were not essential and developed after single-photon detection. These experiments collectively provide a new understanding of the two kinds of photoreceptors and help to explain how gene duplication and the formation of rod-specific proteins produced the duplex retina, which has remained remarkably constant in physiology from amphibians to man.

"BACKGROUND: The host represents a heterogeneous ecosystem where multiple parasite species co-occur and interact with each other for space and resources. Although these interactions may rule the features of an infracommunity and may shape the infracommunity response to external perturbations, the resilience of ectoparasite communities to new infestations remains poorly explored. METHODS: We analysed the composition of the ectoparasite communities found on 214 individual Iberian ibexes (Capra pyrenaica) inhabiting the Sierra Nevada Natural Space, southern Spain. Using classification and regression trees, we explored how the presence of Sarcoptes scabiei (a highly contagious mite), the off-host environment and the host sex govern the prevalence and abundance of lice and ticks. Null model analysis was applied to assess the impact of S. scabiei on the structure of the ectoparasite communities. RESULTS: Our results suggest that S. scabiei infestation acts in tandem with off-host environment and host sex to define the prevalence and abundance of lice and ticks. We also provided evidence for differences in species co-occurrence only at the early stages of S. scabiei infestation. Regarding species diversity, we recorded that ectoparasite communities in scabietic ibexes reached a high richness faster than those in healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Even though we show that ectoparasite burden is correlated with S. scabiei infestation, off-host environment and host sex, the species response to S. scabiei infestation and climate seem to be highly variable and influenced by ectoparasite life-history traits. Ectoparasite communities also appear resilient to perturbations which is in agreement with what was previously reported for endoparasites. Future refinement of sample collection and the incorporation of ecological and epidemiological-related variables may allow us to establish causal effects and deepen the knowledge about the mechanisms and consequences of ectoparasite interactions.

"Global environmental changes are causing Lyme disease to emerge in Europe. The life cycle of Ixodes ricinus, the tick vector of Lyme disease, involves an ontogenetic niche shift, from the larval and nymphal stages utilizing a wide range of hosts, picking up the pathogens causing Lyme disease from small vertebrates, to the adult stage depending on larger (non-transmission) hosts, typically deer. Because of this complexity the role of different host species for emergence of Lyme disease remains controversial. Here, by analysing long-term data on incidence in humans over a broad geographical scale in Norway, we show that both high spatial and temporal deer population density increase Lyme disease incidence. However, the trajectories of deer population sizes play an overall limited role for the recent emergence of the disease. Our study suggests that managing deer populations will have some effect on disease incidence, but that Lyme disease may nevertheless increase as multiple drivers are involved.

"Despite the importance of host attributes for the likelihood of associated microbial transmission, individual variation is seldom considered in studies of wildlife disease. Here, we test the influence of host phenotypes on social network structure and the likelihood of cuticular bacterial transmission from exposed individuals to susceptible group-mates using female social spiders (Stegodyphus dumicola). Based on the interactions of resting individuals of known behavioural types, we assessed whether individuals assorted according to their behavioural traits. We found that individuals preferentially interacted with individuals of unlike behavioural phenotypes. We next applied a green fluorescent protein-transformed cuticular bacterium,Pantoeasp., to individuals and allowed them to interact with an unexposed colony-mate for 24 h. We found evidence for transmission of bacteria in 55% of cases. The likelihood of transmission was influenced jointly by the behavioural phenotypes of both the exposed and susceptible individuals: transmission was more likely when exposed spiders exhibited higher 'boldness' relative to their colony-mate, and when unexposed individuals were in better body condition. Indirect transmission via shared silk took place in only 15% of cases. Thus, bodily contact appears key to transmission in this system. These data represent a fundamental step towards understanding how individual traits influence larger-scale social and epidemiological dynamics.

"Animal behaviour and the ecology and evolution of parasites are inextricably linked. For this reason, animal behaviourists and disease ecologists have been interested in the intersection of their respective fields for decades. Despite this interest, most research at the behaviour-disease interface focuses either on how host behaviour affects parasites or how parasites affect behaviour, with little overlap between the two. Yet, the majority of interactions between hosts and parasites are probably reciprocal, such that host behaviour feeds back on parasites and vice versa. Explicitly considering these feedbacks is essential for understanding the complex connections between animal behaviour and parasite ecology and evolution. To illustrate this point, we discuss how host behaviour-parasite feedbacks might operate and explore the consequences of feedback for studies of animal behaviour and parasites. For example, ignoring the feedback of host social structure on parasite dynamics can limit the accuracy of predictions about parasite spread. Likewise, considering feedback in studies of parasites and animal personalities may provide unique insight about the maintenance of variation in personality types. Finally, applying the feedback concept to links between host behaviour and beneficial, rather than pathogenic, microbes may shed new light on transitions between mutualism and parasitism. More generally, accounting for host behaviour-parasite feedbacks can help identify critical gaps in our understanding of how key host behaviours and parasite traits evolve and are maintained.

"Lyme disease has emerged as a major health concern in Canada, where the etiological agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), a spirochetal bacterium, is typically spread by the bite of certain ticks. This study explores the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, collected at Dundas, Ontario (a locality within the region of Hamilton-Wentworth). Using passive surveillance, veterinarians and pet groomers were asked to collect blacklegged ticks from dogs and cats with no history of travel. Additionally, I. scapularis specimens were submitted from local residents and collected by flagging. Overall, 12 (41%) of 29 blacklegged ticks were infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, two borrelial amplicons were characterized as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), a genospecies pathogenic to humans and certain domestic animals. Notably, three different vertebrate hosts each had two engorged I. scapularis females removed on the same day and, likewise, one cat had three repeat occurrences of this tick species. These multiple infestations suggest that a population of I. scapularis may be established in this area. The local public health unit has been underreporting the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected I. scapularis in the area encompassing Dundas. Our findings raise concerns about the need to erect tick warning signs in parkland areas. Veterinarians, medical professionals, public health officials, and the general public must be vigilant that Lyme disease-carrying blacklegged ticks pose a public health risk in the Dundas area and the surrounding Hamilton-Wentworth region.

"Emerging zoonoses have had a serious impact on human and animal health in recent decades. More often than not, these disease outbreaks have taken public health by surprise because we have failed to shift the epidemiological curve to the far left and detect zoonoses in animal populations prior to spillover to people. Not only can animals serve as valuable sentinels for emerging zoonoses but also much can be gained by the study of the animals themselves.

"BACKGROUND: Understanding aggregation of ticks on hosts and attachment of life stages to different host species, are central components for understanding tick-borne disease epidemiology. The generalist tick, Ixodes ricinus, is a well-known vector of Lyme borrelioses, while the specialist tick, Ixodes trianguliceps, feeding only on small mammals, may play a role in maintaining infection levels in hosts. In a northern forest in Norway, we aimed to quantify the role of different small mammal species in feeding ticks, to determine the extent to which body mass, even among small mammals, plays a role for tick load, and to determine the seasonal pattern of the two tick species. METHODS: Small mammals were captured along transects in two nearby areas along the west coast of Norway. All life stages of ticks were counted. Tick load, including both prevalence and intensity, was analysed with negative binomial models. RESULTS: A total of 359 rodents and shrews were captured with a total of 1106 I. ricinus (60.0 %) and 737 I. trianguliceps (40.4 %), consisting of 98.2 % larvae and 1.8 % nymphs of I. ricinus and 91.2 % larvae, 8.7 % nymphs and 0.1 % adult females of I. trianguliceps. Due to high abundance, Sorex araneus fed most of the larvae of both tick species (I. ricinus 61.9 %, I. trianguliceps 64.9 %) with Apodemus sylvaticus (I. ricinus 20.4 %, I. trianguliceps 10.0 %) and Myodes glareolus (I. ricinus 10.9 %, I. trianguliceps 9.5 %) as the next most important hosts. Individual A. sylvaticus and M. glareolus had higher infestation intensity than S. araneus, while Sorex minutus had markedly lower infestation intensity. The load of I. ricinus larvae and nymphs was related to body mass mainly up to ~10 g, while the load of I. trianguliceps was less dependent of body mass. The load of I. trianguliceps was higher in spring than in fall, while the seasonal pattern was reversed for I. ricinus with higher loads in fall. CONCLUSIONS: Body mass was important for explaining load of I. ricinus mainly up to a body mass of ~10 g across a range of smaller mammalian hosts. Consistent with earlier work elsewhere in Europe, we found the highest tick infestation intensity on the wood mouse A. sylvaticus. However, this rodent species fed only 20.4 % of all I. ricinus larvae, while the much more abundant S. araneus fed 61.9 %. Our study emphasizes an important quantitative role of the common shrew S. araneus as a main host to I. ricinus larvae and to both I. trianguliceps larvae and nymphs. The partly seasonal distinct attachment pattern of I. ricinus and I. trianguliceps is evidence for niche separation.

"Cryptosporidium is an enteric parasite that is transmitted via the faecal-oral route, water and food. Humans, wildlife and domestic livestock all potentially contribute Cryptosporidium to surface waters. Human encroachment into natural ecosystems has led to an increase in interactions between humans, domestic animals and wildlife populations. Increasing numbers of zoonotic diseases and spill over/back of zoonotic pathogens is a consequence of this anthropogenic disturbance. Drinking water catchments and water reservoir areas have been at the front line of this conflict as they can be easily contaminated by zoonotic waterborne pathogens. Therefore, the epidemiology of zoonotic species of Cryptosporidium in free-ranging and captive wildlife is of increasing importance. This review focuses on zoonotic Cryptosporidium species reported in global wildlife populations to date, and highlights their significance for public health and the water industry.

"Given the relatively recent recognition of Lyme disease (LD) by CDC in 1990 as a nationally notifiable infectious condition, the rise of reported human cases every year argues for a better understanding of its geographic scope. The aim of this inquiry was to explore research conducted on spatiotemporal patterns of Lyme disease in order to identify strategies for implementing vector and reservoir-targeted interventions. The focus of this review is on the use of GIS-based methods to study populations of the reservoir hosts, vectors and humans in addition to the spatiotemporal interactions between these populations. New GIS-based studies are monitoring occurrence at the macro-level, and helping pinpoint areas of occurrence at the micro-level, where spread within populations of reservoir hosts, clusters of infected ticks and tick to human transmission may be better understood.

"Specimens and associated data in natural history collections (NHCs) foster substantial scientific progress. In this paper, we explore recent contributions of NHCs to the study of systematics and biogeography, genomics, morphology, stable isotope ecology, and parasites and pathogens of mammals. To begin to assess the magnitude and scope of these contributions, we analyzed publications in the Journal of Mammalogy over the last decade, as well as recent research supported by a single university mammal collection (Museum of Southwestern Biology, Division of Mammals). Using these datasets, we also identify weak links that may be hindering the development of crucial NHC infrastructure. Maintaining the vitality and growth of this foundation of mammalogy depends on broader engagement and support from across the scientific community and is both an ethical and scientific imperative given the rapidly changing environmental conditions on our planet.

"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne relapsing fevers of humans are caused by spirochetes that must adapt to both warm-blooded vertebrates and cold-blooded ticks. In western North America, most human cases of relapsing fever are caused by Borrelia hermsii, which cycles in nature between its tick vector Ornithodoros hermsi and small mammals such as tree squirrels and chipmunks. These spirochetes alter their outer surface by switching off one of the bloodstream-associated variable major proteins (Vmps) they produce in mammals, and replacing it with the variable tick protein (Vtp) following their acquisition by ticks. Based on this reversion to Vtp in ticks, we produced experimental vaccines comprised on this protein and tested them in mice challenged by infected ticks. METHODS: The vtp gene from two isolates of B. hermsii that encoded antigenically distinct types of proteins were cloned, expressed, and the recombinant Vtp proteins were purified and used to vaccinate mice. Ornithodoros hermsi ticks that were infected with one of the two strains of B. hermsii from which the vtp gene originated were used to challenge mice that received one of the two Vtp vaccines or only adjuvant. Mice were then followed for infection and seroconversion. RESULTS: The Vtp vaccines produced protective immune responses in mice challenged with O. hermsi ticks infected with B. hermsii. However, polymorphism in Vtp resulted in mice being protected only from the spirochete strain that produced the same Vtp used in the vaccine; mice challenged with spirochetes producing the antigenically different Vtp than the vaccine succumbed to infection. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that by having knowledge of the phenotypic changes made by B. hermsii as the spirochetes are acquired by ticks from infected mammals, an effective vaccine was developed that protected mice when challenged with infected ticks. However, the Vtp vaccines only protected mice from infection when challenged with that strain producing the identical Vtp. A vaccine containing multiple Vtp types may have promise as an oral vaccine for wild mammals if applied to geographic settings such as small islands where the mammal diversity is low and the Vtp types in the B. hermsii population are defined.

"Many vector-borne pathogens consist of multiple strains that circulate in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector. Characterization of the community of pathogen strains in the arthropod vector is therefore important for understanding the epidemiology of mixed vector-borne infections. Borrelia afzelii and B. garinii are two species of tick-borne bacteria that cause Lyme disease in humans. These two sympatric pathogens use the same tick, Ixodes ricinus, but are adapted to different classes of vertebrate hosts. Both Borrelia species consist of multiple strains that are classified using the highly polymorphic ospC gene. Vertebrate cross-immunity against the OspC antigen is predicted to structure the community of multiple-strain Borrelia pathogens. Borrelia isolates were cultured from field-collected I. ricinus ticks over a period spanning 11 years. The Borrelia species of each isolate was identified using a reverse line blot (RLB) assay. Deep sequencing was used to characterize the ospC communities of 190 B. afzelii isolates and 193 B. garinii isolates. Infections with multiple ospC strains were common in ticks, but vertebrate cross-immunity did not influence the strain structure in the tick vector. The pattern of genetic variation at the ospC locus suggested that vertebrate cross-immunity exerts strong selection against intermediately divergent ospC alleles. Deep sequencing found that more than 50% of our isolates contained exotic ospC alleles derived from other Borrelia species. Two alternative explanations for these exotic ospC alleles are cryptic coinfections that were not detected by the RLB assay or horizontal transfer of the ospC gene between Borrelia species.

"In a recent article, we described a conceptual and analytical model to identify the key host species for parasite transmission in multi-host communities and used data from 11 gastro-intestinal parasites infecting up to five small mammal host species as an illustrative example of how the framework could be applied. A limitation of these empirical data was uncertainty in the identification of parasite species using egg/oocyst morphology, which could overestimate parasite sharing between host species. Here, we show that the key results of the original analysis, namely that (1) parasites naturally infect multiple host species, but typically rely on a small subset of infected host species for long-term maintenance, (2) that different mechanisms underlie how particular host species dominate transmission and (3) that these different mechanisms influence the predicted efficiency of disease control measures, are robust to analysis of a smaller subset of host-parasite combinations that we have greatest confidence in identifying. We further comment briefly on the need for accurate parasite identification, ideally using molecular techniques to quantify cross-species transmission and differentiate covert host specificity from true host generalism.

"In North America, Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne zoonosis caused by the spirochete bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is maintained by wildlife. Tick vectors and bacteria are currently spreading into Canada and causing increasing numbers of cases of LD in humans and raising a pressing need for public health responses. There is no vaccine, and LD prevention depends on knowing who is at risk and informing them how to protect themselves from infection. Recently, it was found in the United States that some strains of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto cause severe disease, whereas others cause mild, self-limiting disease. While many strains occurring in the United States also occur in Canada, strains in some parts of Canada are different from those in the United States. We therefore recognize a need to identify which strains specific to Canada can cause severe disease and to characterize their geographic distribution to determine which Canadians are particularly at risk. In this review, we summarize the history of emergence of LD in North America, our current knowledge of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto diversity, its intriguing origins in the ecology and evolution of the bacterium, and its importance for the epidemiology and clinical and laboratory diagnosis of LD. We propose methods for investigating associations between B. burgdorferi sensu stricto diversity, ecology, and pathogenicity and for developing predictive tools to guide public health interventions. We also highlight the emergence of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in Canada as a unique opportunity for exploring the evolutionary aspects of tick-borne pathogen emergence.

"BACKGROUND: Ectoparasites rely on blood-feeding to sustain activity, support development and produce offspring. Blood-feeding is also a route for transmission of diverse vector-borne pathogens. The likelihood of successfully feeding is thus an important aspect of ectoparasite population dynamics and pathogen transmission. Factors that affect blood-feeding include ectoparasite density, host defenses, and ages of the host and ectoparasite. How these factors interact to affect feeding success is not well understood. METHODS: We monitored blood-feeding success of larval Rocky Mountain wood ticks (RMWTs; Dermacentor andersoni) on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in several experiments to determine how tick density, host defense, and ages of mice and ticks interact to influence feeding success. In the first experiment, tick-naive deer mice were infested with one of several densities of RMWT larvae, while a second cohort of mice were infested with 50 larvae each. Two weeks after ticks dropped off, mice in the first cohort were re-exposed to 50 larvae each and mice in the second cohort were re-exposed to varying densities of larvae. In the second experiment mice of different ages (45-374 days old) were exposed to 50 larvae each. Two weeks later mice were re-exposed to 50 larvae each. We combined data from these and several similar experiments to test the generality of the patterns we observed. Lastly, we tested whether tick feeding success was consistent on individual mice that were challenged on four occasions. RESULTS: Mice acquired resistance such that feeding success declined dramatically from the first to the second infestation. Feeding success also declined with tick density and tick age. Mice, however, became more permissive with age. The sizes of these effects were similar and additive. Surprisingly, over successive infestations the relative resistance among mice changed among hosts within a cohort. CONCLUSIONS: We predict that larval blood-feeding success, and thus development to the nymph stage, will change due to variation in tick age and density, as well as the age and history of the host. Incorporating these biotic factors into modeling of tick population dynamics may improve predictions of tick-borne pathogen transmission.

"Despite the expression of homologous phototransduction components, the molecular basis for differences in light-evoked responses between rod and cone photoreceptors remains unclear. We examined the role of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE6) in this difference by expressing cone PDE6 (PDE6C) in rd1/rd1 rods lacking rod PDE6 (PDE6AB) using transgenic mice. The expression of PDE6C rescues retinal degeneration observed in rd1/rd1 rods. Double-transgenic rods (PDE6C++) were compared with rd1/+ rods based on similar PDE6 expression. PDE6C increased the basal PDE activity and speeded the rate-limiting step for phototransduction deactivation, causing rod photoresponses to appear light adapted, with reduced dark current and sensitivity and faster response kinetics. When PDE6C++ and rd1/+ rods were exposed to similar background light, rd1/+ rods displayed greater desensitization. These results indicate an increased spontaneous activity and faster deactivation of PDE6C compared with PDE6AB in darkness, but that background light increases steady PDE6C activity to a lesser extent. In addition to accelerating the recovery of the photoresponse, faster PDE6C deactivation may blunt the rise in background-induced steady PDE6C activity. Therefore, higher basal PDE6C activity and faster deactivation together partially account for faster and less sensitive cone photoresponses in darkness, whereas a reduced rise of steady PDE6C activity in background light may allow cones to avoid saturation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Cones are the primary photoreceptors responsible for most of our visual experience. Cone light responses are less sensitive and display speeded responses compared with rods. Despite the fact that rods and cones use a G-protein signaling cascade with similar organization, the mechanistic basis for these differences remains unclear. Here, we examined the role of distinct isoforms of PDE6, the effector enzyme in phototransduction, in these differences. We developed a transgenic mouse model that expresses cone PDE6 in rods and show that the cone PDE6 isoform is partially responsible for the difference in sensitivity and response kinetics between rods and cones.

"Invasive vertebrate species can act as hosts for endemic pathogens and may alter pathogen community composition and dynamics. For the zoonotic pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, recent work shows invasive rodent species can be of high epidemiological importance and may support host-specific strains. This study examined the role of gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) (n = 679), an invasive species in the United Kingdom, as B. burgdorferi sensu lato hosts. We found that gray squirrels were frequently infested with Ixodes ricinus, the main vector of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the United Kingdom, and 11.9% were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato. All four genospecies that occur in the United Kingdom were detected in gray squirrels, and unexpectedly, the bird-associated genospecies Borrelia garinii was most common. The second most frequent infection was with Borrelia afzelii. Genotyping of B. garinii and B. afzelii produced no evidence for strains associated with gray squirrels. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) identified tick infestation and date of capture as significant factors associated with B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection in gray squirrels, with infection elevated in early summer in squirrels infested with ticks. Invasive gray squirrels appear to become infected with locally circulating strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato, and further studies are required to determine their role in community disease dynamics. Our findings highlight the fact that the role of introduced host species in B. burgdorferi sensu lato epidemiology can be highly variable and thus difficult to predict.

"Small mammal dispersal is strongly affected by geographical barriers. However, commensal small mammals may be passively transported over large distances and strong barriers by humans (often with agricultural products). This pattern should be especially apparent in topographically complex landscapes, such as mountain ranges, where valleys and/or peaks can limit dispersal of less vagile species. We predict that commensal species would have lower genetic differentiation and higher migration rates than related non-commensals in such landscapes. We contrasted population genetic differentiation in two sympatric Rattus species (R. satarae and R. rattus) in the Western Ghats mountains in southern India. We sampled rats from villages and adjacent forests in seven locations (20-640 km apart). Capture-based statistics confirmed that R. rattus is abundant in human settlements in this region, whereas R. satarae is non-commensal and found mostly in forests. Population structure analyses using ~970-bp mitochondrial control region and 17 microsatellite loci revealed higher differentiation for the non-commensal species (R. satarae F-statistics=0.420, 0.065, R. rattus F-statistics=0.195, 0.034; mitochondrial DNA, microsatellites, respectively). Genetic clustering analyses confirm that clusters in R. satarae are more distinct and less admixed than those in R. rattus. R. satarae shows higher slope for isolation-by-distance compared with R. rattus. Although mode of migration estimates do not strongly suggest higher rates in R. rattus than in R. satarae, they indicate that migration over long distances could still be higher in R. rattus. We suggest that association with humans could drive the observed pattern of differentiation in the commensal R. rattus, consequently impacting not only their dispersal abilities, but also their evolutionary trajectories.
"
"The phenology of tick emergence has important implications for the transmission of tick-borne pathogens. A long lag between the emergence of tick nymphs in spring and larvae in summer should increase transmission of persistent pathogens by allowing infected nymphs to inoculate the population of naive hosts that can subsequently transmit the pathogen to larvae to complete the transmission cycle. In contrast, greater synchrony between nymphs and larvae should facilitate transmission of pathogens that do not produce long-lasting infections in hosts. Here, we use 19 years of data on blacklegged ticks attached to small-mammal hosts to quantify the relationship between climate warming and tick phenology. Warmer years through May and August were associated with a nearly three-week advance in the phenology of nymphal and larval ticks relative to colder years, with little evidence of increased synchrony. Warmer Octobers were associated with fewer larvae feeding concurrently with nymphs during the following spring. Projected warming by the 2050s is expected to advance the timing of average nymph and larva activity by 8-11 and 10-14 days, respectively. If these trends continue, climate warming should maintain or increase transmission of persistent pathogens, while it might inhibit pathogens that do not produce long-lasting infections.

"Since its initial isolation in Uganda in 1937 through the present, West Nile virus (WNV) has become an important cause of human and animal disease worldwide. WNV, an enveloped virus of the genus Flavivirus, is naturally maintained in an enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes, with occasional epizootic spillover causing disease in humans and horses. The mosquito vectors for WNV are widely distributed worldwide, and the known geographic range of WNV transmission and disease has continued to increase over the past 77 years. While most human infections with WNV are asymptomatic, severe neurological disease may develop resulting in long-term sequelae or death. Surveillance and preventive measures are an ongoing need to reduce the public health impact of WNV in areas with the potential for transmission.

"Zoonotic pathogens that cause devastating morbidity and mortality in humans may be relatively harmless in their natural reservoir hosts. The tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease in humans but few studies have investigated whether this pathogen reduces the fitness of its reservoir hosts under natural conditions. We analyzed four years of capture-mark-recapture (CMR) data on a population of white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, to test whether B. burgdorferi and its tick vector affect the survival of this important reservoir host. We used a multi-state CMR approach to model mouse survival and mouse infection rates as a function of a variety of ecologically relevant explanatory factors. We found no effect of B. burgdorferi infection or tick burden on the survival of P. leucopus. Our estimates of the probability of infection varied by an order of magnitude (0.051 to 0.535) and were consistent with our understanding of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States. B. burgdorferi establishes a chronic avirulent infection in their rodent reservoir hosts because this pathogen depends on rodent mobility to achieve transmission to its sedentary tick vector. The estimates of B. burgdorferi infection risk will facilitate future theoretical studies on the epidemiology of Lyme disease.

"Culturally transmitted traits are observed in a wide array of animal species, yet we understand little about the costs of the behavioural patterns that underlie culture, such as innovation and social learning. We propose that infectious diseases are a significant cost associated with cultural transmission. We investigated two hypotheses that may explain such a connection: that social learning and exploratory behaviours (specifically, innovation and extractive foraging) either compensate for existing infection or increase exposure to infectious agents. We used Bayesian comparative methods, controlling for sampling effort, body mass, group size, geographical range size, terrestriality, latitude and phylogenetic uncertainty. Across 127 primate species, we found a positive association between pathogen richness and rates of innovation, extractive foraging and social learning. This relationship was driven by two independent phenomena: socially contagious diseases were positively associated with rates of social learning, and environmentally transmitted diseases were positively associated with rates of exploration. Because higher pathogen burdens can contribute to morbidity and mortality, we propose that parasitism is a significant cost associated with the behavioural patterns that underpin culture, and that increased pathogen exposure is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of culture in both non-human primates and humans.

"Tick-borne diseases represent major public and animal health issues worldwide. Ixodes ricinus, primarily associated with deciduous and mixed forests, is the principal vector of causative agents of viral, bacterial, and protozoan zoonotic diseases in Europe. Recently, abundant tick populations have been observed in European urban green areas, which are of public health relevance due to the exposure of humans and domesticated animals to potentially infected ticks. In urban habitats, small and medium-sized mammals, birds, companion animals (dogs and cats), and larger mammals (roe deer and wild boar) play a role in maintenance of tick populations and as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens. Presence of ticks infected with tick-borne encephalitis virus and high prevalence of ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., causing Lyme borreliosis, have been reported from urbanized areas in Europe. Emerging pathogens, including bacteria of the order Rickettsiales (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis,"" Rickettsia helvetica, and R. monacensis), Borrelia miyamotoi, and protozoans (Babesia divergens, B. venatorum, and B. microti) have also been detected in urban tick populations. Understanding the ecology of ticks and their associations with hosts in a European urbanized environment is crucial to quantify parameters necessary for risk pre-assessment and identification of public health strategies for control and prevention of tick-borne diseases.

"Lyme disease imposes increasing global public health challenges. To better understand the joint effects of seasonal temperature variation and host community composition on the pathogen transmission, a stage-structured periodic model is proposed by integrating seasonal tick development and activity, multiple host species and complex pathogen transmission routes between ticks and reservoirs. Two thresholds, one for tick population dynamics and the other for Lyme-pathogen transmission dynamics, are identified and shown to fully classify the long-term outcomes of the tick invasion and disease persistence. Seeding with the realistic parameters, the tick reproduction threshold and Lyme disease spread threshold are estimated to illustrate the joint effects of the climate change and host community diversity on the pattern of Lyme disease risk. It is shown that climate warming can amplify the disease risk and slightly change the seasonality of disease risk. Both the ""dilution effect"" and ""amplification effect"" are observed by feeding the model with different possible alternative hosts. Therefore, the relationship between the host community biodiversity and disease risk varies, calling for more accurate measurements on the local environment, both biotic and abiotic such as the temperature and the host community composition.

"Adult mortality can be a major driver of population decline in species whose productivity is relatively low. Yet, little is known about the factors influencing adult survival rates in migratory bird species, nor do we know much about the longer-term effects of habitat disturbance on the fitness of individuals. The Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) is one of the vertebrate species most sensitive to forest management, yet it is still common and widespread. We monitored the fate of 330 colour-banded Ovenbird males in four pairs of 25-ha plots during 9 successive breeding seasons. One plot of each pair was treated through selection harvesting (30-40% basal area removed) during the first winter. We tested the following hypotheses: (1) higher physiological costs in harvested plots as a result of lower food abundance will reduce apparent survival rate (ASR) relative to controls; (2) lower ASR following years with low nest survival and higher probability of renesting; (3) fluctuations in ASR reflecting El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO); and (4) higher ASR in returning males than in recruits (unbanded immigrants) owing to greater site familiarity in the former. We tested the relative importance of these hypotheses, or combinations thereof, by generating 23 models explaining variation in ASR. The year-dependent model received the most support, showing a 41% decrease in ASR from 2007 to 2014. The important year-to-year variation we observed in ASR (Σw(i) = 0.99) was not explained by variation in nest predation risk nor by ENSO. There was also little evidence for an effect of selection harvesting on ASR of Ovenbird males, despite a slight reduction in lifespan relative to males from control plots (2.7 vs 2.9 years). An avenue worth exploring to explain this intriguing pattern would be to determine whether conditions at migratory stopover sites or in the wintering area of our focal population have gradually worsened over the past decade.

"This review examines the phenomenon of co-feeding transmission in tick-borne pathogens. This mode of transmission is critical for the epidemiology of several tick-borne viruses but its importance for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, is still controversial. The molecular mechanisms and ecological factors that facilitate co-feeding transmission are therefore examined with particular emphasis on Borrelia pathogens. Comparison of climate, tick ecology and experimental infection work suggests that co-feeding transmission is more important in European than North American systems of Lyme borreliosis, which potentially explains why this topic has gained more traction in the former continent than the latter. While new theory shows that co-feeding transmission makes a modest contribution to Borrelia fitness, recent experimental work has revealed new ecological contexts where natural selection might favour co-feeding transmission. In particular, co-feeding transmission might confer a fitness advantage in the Darwinian competition among strains in mixed infections. Future studies should investigate the ecological conditions that favour the evolution of this fascinating mode of transmission in tick-borne pathogens.

"Animal and plant species differ dramatically in their quality as hosts for multi-host pathogens, but the causes of this variation are poorly understood. A group of small mammals, including small rodents and shrews, are among the most competent natural reservoirs for three tick-borne zoonotic pathogens, Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, in eastern North America. For a group of nine commonly-infected mammals spanning >2 orders of magnitude in body mass, we asked whether life history features or surrogates for (unknown) encounter rates with ticks, predicted reservoir competence for each pathogen. Life history features associated with a fast pace of life generally were positively correlated with reservoir competence. However, a model comparison approach revealed that host population density, as a proxy for encounter rates between hosts and pathogens, generally received more support than did life history features. The specific life history features and the importance of host population density differed somewhat between the different pathogens. We interpret these results as supporting two alternative but non-exclusive hypotheses for why ecologically widespread, synanthropic species are often the most competent reservoirs for multi-host pathogens. First, multi-host pathogens might adapt to those hosts they are most likely to experience, which are likely to be the most abundant and/or frequently bitten by tick vectors. Second, species with fast life histories might allocate less to certain immune defenses, which could increase their reservoir competence. Results suggest that of the host species that might potentially be exposed, those with comparatively high population densities, small bodies, and fast pace of life will often be keystone reservoirs that should be targeted for surveillance or management.

"Many human viral infections have a zoonotic, i.e., wild or domestic animal, origin. Several zoonotic viruses are transmitted to humans directly via contact with an animal or indirectly via exposure to the urine or feces of infected animals or the bite of a bloodsucking arthropod. If a virus is able to adapt and replicate in its new human host, human-to-human transmissions may occur, possibly resulting in an epidemic, such as the A/H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009. Thus, predicting emerging zoonotic infections is an important challenge for public health officials in the coming decades. The recent development of viral metagenomics, i.e., the characterization of the complete viral diversity isolated from an organism or an environment using high-throughput sequencing technologies, is promising for the surveillance of such diseases and can be accomplished by analyzing the viromes of selected animals and arthropods that are closely in contact with humans. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of viral diversity within such animals (in particular blood-feeding arthropods, wildlife and domestic animals) using metagenomics and present its possible future application for the surveillance of zoonotic and arboviral diseases.

"Predicting the geographic spread of wildlife epidemics requires knowledge about the movement patterns of disease hosts or vectors. The field of landscape genetics provides valuable approaches to study dispersal indirectly, which in turn may be used to understand patterns of disease spread. Here, we applied landscape genetic analyses and spatially explicit models to identify the potential path of raccoon rabies spread in a mesocarnivore community. We used relatedness estimates derived from microsatellite genotypes of raccoons and striped skunks to investigate their dispersal patterns in a heterogeneous landscape composed predominantly of agricultural, forested and residential areas. Samples were collected in an area covering 22 000 km(2) in southern Québec, where the raccoon rabies variant (RRV) was first detected in 2006. Multiple regressions on distance matrices revealed that genetic distance among male raccoons was strictly a function of geographic distance, while dispersal in female raccoons was significantly reduced by the presence of agricultural fields. In skunks, our results suggested that dispersal is increased in edge habitats between fields and forest fragments in both males and females. Resistance modelling allowed us to identify likely dispersal corridors used by these two rabies hosts, which may prove especially helpful for surveillance and control (e.g. oral vaccination) activities.

"Mitochondria play a fundamental role in cellular metabolism, being responsible for most of the energy production of the cell in the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for key components of this process, but its direct role in adaptation remains far from understood. Hares (Lepus spp.) are privileged models to study the impact of natural selection on mitogenomic evolution because 1) species are adapted to contrasting environments, including arctic, with different metabolic pressures, and 2) mtDNA introgression from arctic into temperate species is widespread. Here, we analyzed the sequences of 11 complete mitogenomes (ten newly obtained) of hares of temperate and arctic origins (including two of arctic origin introgressed into temperate species). The analysis of patterns of codon substitutions along the reconstructed phylogeny showed evidence for positive selection in several codons in genes of the OXPHOS complexes, most notably affecting the arctic lineage. However, using theoretical models, no predictable effect of these differences was found on the structure and physicochemical properties of the encoded proteins, suggesting that the focus of selection may lie on complex interactions with nuclear encoded peptides. Also, a cloverleaf structure was detected in the control region only from the arctic mtDNA lineage, which may influence mtDNA replication and transcription. These results suggest that adaptation impacted the evolution of hare mtDNA and may have influenced the occurrence and consequences of the many reported cases of massive mtDNA introgression. However, the origin of adaptation remains elusive.

"Cryptosporidium ubiquitum is an emerging zoonotic pathogen. In the past, it was not possible to identify an association between cases of human and animal infection. We conducted a genomic survey of the species, developed a subtyping tool targeting the 60-kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene, and identified 6 subtype families (XIIa-XIIf) of C. ubiquitum. Host adaptation was apparent at the gp60 locus; subtype XIIa was found in ruminants worldwide, subtype families XIIb-XIId were found in rodents in the United States, and XIIe and XIIf were found in rodents in the Slovak Republic. Humans in the United States were infected with isolates of subtypes XIIb-XIId, whereas those in other areas were infected primarily with subtype XIIa isolates. In addition, subtype families XIIb and XIId were detected in drinking source water in the United States. Contact with C. ubiquitum-infected sheep and drinking water contaminated by infected wildlife could be sources of human infections.

"West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus; Flaviviridae) is the cause of the most widespread arthropod-borne viral disease in the world and the largest outbreak of neuroinvasive disease ever observed. Mosquito-borne outbreaks are influenced by intrinsic (e.g., vector and viral genetics, vector and host competence, vector life-history traits) and extrinsic (e.g., temperature, rainfall, human land use) factors that affect virus activity and mosquito biology in complex ways. The concept of vectorial capacity integrates these factors to address interactions of the virus with the arthropod host, leading to a clearer understanding of their complex interrelationships, how they affect transmission of vector-borne disease, and how they impact human health. Vertebrate factors including host competence, population dynamics, and immune status also affect transmission dynamics. The complexity of these interactions are further exacerbated by the fact that not only can divergent hosts differentially alter the virus, but the virus also can affect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts in ways that significantly alter patterns of virus transmission. This chapter concentrates on selected components of the virus-vector-vertebrate interrelationship, focusing specifically on how interactions between vector, virus, and environment shape the patterns and intensity of WNV transmission.

"Mixed infections have important consequences for the ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions. In vector-borne diseases, interactions between pathogens occur in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector. Spirochete bacteria belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies complex are transmitted by Ixodes ticks and cause Lyme borreliosis in humans. In Europe, there is a high diversity of Borrelia pathogens, and the main tick vector, Ixodes ricinus, is often infected with multiple Borrelia genospecies. In the present study, we characterized the pairwise interactions between five B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies in a large data set of I. ricinus ticks collected from the same field site in Switzerland. We measured two types of pairwise interactions: (i) co-occurrence, whether double infections occurred more or less often than expected, and (ii) spirochete load additivity, whether the total spirochete load in double infections was greater or less than the sum of the single infections. Mixed infections of Borrelia genospecies specialized on different vertebrate reservoir hosts occurred less frequently than expected (negative co-occurrence) and had joint spirochete loads that were lower than the additive expectation (inhibition). In contrast, mixed infections of genospecies that share the same reservoir hosts were more common than expected (positive co-occurrence) and had joint spirochete loads that were similar to or greater than the additive expectation (facilitation). Our study suggests that the vertebrate host plays an important role in structuring the community of B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies inside the tick vector.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Ticks are highly susceptible to global environmental and socio-economical changes. Several tick-borne pathogens have been reported in new geographical regions while new species, strains or genetic variants of tick-borne microorganisms are continually being detected. However, tick-borne pathogens are still poorly understood, and it is estimated that half of all human tick-borne disease has an unknown origin. Therefore in order to prevent these diseases, more effort is required to identify unknown or unexpected tick-borne pathogens. Ixodes ricinus is the vector for a broad range of bacterial pathogens and the most prevalent tick in Europe. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the capability of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to extend the inventory of pathogenic bacteria carried by this species of tick in France. METHODS: RNA and DNA were extracted from 1450 I. ricinus questing nymphs collected by flagging in Alsace, France. RNA was pooled and used for NGS. Following de novo assembly, bacterial contigs were assigned to the closest known taxonomy. DNA was used for real time PCR to confirm taxonomic species assignment of NGS-derived contigs for the doubtful cases, and for determination of prevalence. RESULTS: We have generated a global in-depth picture of tick-borne bacteria. We identified RNA from the main pathogenic bacterial species known to be transmitted by I. ricinus. In addition we also identified unanticipated bacterial species for which we have estimated the prevalence within those ticks inhabiting the studied areas. CONCLUSIONS: The data obtained from this study has proven that NGS has an enormous potential to detect the unexpected and provides the means to monitor pathogen occurrence.

"The mammalian diving response is a remarkable behavior that overrides basic homeostatic reflexes. It is most studied in large aquatic mammals but is seen in all vertebrates. Pelagic mammals have developed several physiological adaptations to conserve intrinsic oxygen stores, but the apnea, bradycardia, and vasoconstriction is shared with those terrestrial and is neurally mediated. The adaptations of aquatic mammals are reviewed here as well as the neural control of cardiorespiratory physiology during diving in rodents.

"Recent epidemic activity and its introduction into the Western Hemisphere have drawn attention to West Nile virus (WNV) as an international public health problem. Of particular concern has been the ability for the virus to cause outbreaks of disease in highly populated urban centers. Incrimination of Australian mosquito species is an essential component in determining the receptivity of Australia to the introduction and/or establishment of an exotic strain of WNV and can guide potential management strategies. Based on vector competence experiments and ecological studies, we suggest candidate Australian mosquito species that would most likely be involved in urban transmission of WNV, along with consideration of the endemic WNV subtype, Kunjin. We then examine the interaction of entomological factors with virological and vertebrate host factors, as well as likely mode of introduction, which may influence the potential for exotic WNV to become established and be maintained in urban transmission cycles in Australia.

"Phosphodiesterase-6 (PDE6) is the key effector enzyme of the vertebrate phototransduction pathway in rods and cones. Rod PDE6 catalytic core is composed of two distinct subunits, PDE6α and PDE6β, whereas two identical PDE6α' subunits form the cone PDE6 catalytic core. It is not known whether this difference in PDE6 catalytic subunit identity contributes to the functional differences between rods and cones. To address this question, we expressed cone PDE6α' in the photoreceptor cells of the retinal degeneration 10 (rd10) mouse that carries a mutation in rod PDEβ subunit. We show that adeno-associated virus-mediated subretinal delivery of PDE6α' rescues rod electroretinogram responses and preserves retinal structure, indicating that cone PDE6α' can couple effectively to the rod phototransduction pathway. We also show that restoration of light sensitivity in rd10 rods is attributable to assembly of PDE6α' with rod PDE6γ. Single-cell recordings revealed that, surprisingly, rods expressing cone PDE6α' are twofold more sensitive to light than wild-type rods, most likely because of the slower shutoff of their light responses. Unlike in wild-type rods, the response kinetics in PDE6α'-treated rd10 rods accelerated with increasing flash intensity, indicating a possible direct feedback modulation of cone PDE6α' activity. Together, these results demonstrate that cone PDE6α' can functionally substitute for rod PDEαβ in vivo, conferring treated rods with distinct physiological properties.

"The interactions between host individual, host population, and environmental factors modulate parasite abundance in a given host population. Since adult exophilic ticks are highly aggregated in red deer (Cervus elaphus) and this ungulate exhibits significant sexual size dimorphism, life history traits and segregation, we hypothesized that tick parasitism on males and hinds would be differentially influenced by each of these factors. To test the hypothesis, ticks from 306 red deer-182 males and 124 females-were collected during 7 years in a red deer population in south-central Spain. By using generalized linear models, with a negative binomial error distribution and a logarithmic link function, we modeled tick abundance on deer with 20 potential predictors. Three models were developed: one for red deer males, another for hinds, and one combining data for males and females and including ""sex"" as factor. Our rationale was that if tick burdens on males and hinds relate to the explanatory factors in a differential way, it is not possible to precisely and accurately predict the tick burden on one sex using the model fitted on the other sex, or with the model that combines data from both sexes. Our results showed that deer males were the primary target for ticks, the weight of each factor differed between sexes, and each sex specific model was not able to accurately predict burdens on the animals of the other sex. That is, results support for sex-biased differences. The higher weight of host individual and population factors in the model for males show that intrinsic deer factors more strongly explain tick burden than environmental host-seeking tick abundance. In contrast, environmental variables predominated in the models explaining tick burdens in hinds.

"BACKGROUND: In natural populations, individuals are infected more often by several pathogens than by just one. In such a context, pathogens can interact. This interaction could modify the probability of infection by subsequent pathogens. Identifying when pathogen associations correspond to biological interactions is a challenge in cross-sectional studies where the sequence of infection cannot be demonstrated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we modelled the probability of an individual being infected by one and then another pathogen, using a probabilistic model and maximum likelihood statistics. Our model was developed to apply to cross-sectional data, vector-borne and persistent pathogens, and to take into account confounding factors. Our modelling approach was more powerful than the commonly used Chi-square test of independence. Our model was applied to detect potential interaction between Borrelia afzelii and Bartonella spp. that infected a bank vole population at 11% and 57% respectively. No interaction was identified. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The modelling approach we proposed is powerful and can identify the direction of potential interaction. Such an approach can be adapted to other types of pathogens, such as non-persistents. The model can be used to identify when co-occurrence patterns correspond to pathogen interactions, which will contribute to understanding how organism communities are assembled and structured. In the long term, the model's capacity to better identify pathogen interactions will improve understanding of infectious risk.

"Controlling parasites that infect multiple host species often requires targeting single species that dominate transmission. Yet, it is rarely recognised that such 'key hosts' can arise through disparate mechanisms, potentially requiring different approaches for control. We identify three distinct, but not mutually exclusive, processes that underlie host species heterogeneity: infection prevalence, population abundance and infectiousness. We construct a theoretical framework to isolate the role of each process from ecological data and to explore the outcome of different control approaches. Applying this framework to data on 11 gastrointestinal parasites in small mammal communities across the eastern United States reveals variation not only in the magnitude of transmission asymmetries among host species but also in the processes driving heterogeneity. These differences influence the efficiency by which different control strategies reduce transmission. Identifying and tailoring interventions to a specific type of key host may therefore enable more effective management of multihost parasites.

"Lyme borreliosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted to humans and domestic animals by the bite of an Ixodes spp. tick (deer tick). Despite improvements in diagnostic tests and public awareness of Lyme disease, the reported cases have increased over the past decade to approximately 30,000 per year. Limitations and failed public acceptance of a human vaccine, comprised of the outer surface A (OspA) lipoprotein of B. burgdorferi, led to its demise, yet current research has opened doors to new strategies for protection against Lyme disease. In this review we discuss the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi, and the unique opportunities it poses to block infection or transmission at different levels. We present the correlates of protection for this infectious disease, the pros and cons of past vaccination strategies, and new paradigms for future vaccine design that would include elements of both the vector and the pathogen.
"
"The variation of the composition in species of host communities can modify the risk of disease transmission. In particular, the introduction of a new host species can increase health threats by adding a new reservoir and/or by amplifying the circulation of either exotic or native pathogens. Lyme borreliosis is a multi-host vector-borne disease caused by bacteria belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. It is transmitted by the bite of hard ticks, especially Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Previous studies showed that the Siberian chipmunk, Tamias sibiricus barberi, an introduced ground squirrel in the Forest of Sénart (near Paris, France) was highly infested by I. ricinus, and consequently infected by B. burgdorferi sl. An index of the contribution of chipmunks to the density of infected questing nymphs on the vegetation (i.e., the acarological risk for humans) was compared to that of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), two known native and sympatric competent reservoir hosts. Chipmunks produced nearly 8.5 times more infected questing nymphs than voles and mice. Furthermore, they contribute to a higher diversity of B. burgdorferi sl genospecies (B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. garinii). The contribution of chipmunks varied between years and seasons, according to tick availability. As T. s. barberi must be a competent reservoir, it should amplify B. burgdorferi sl infection, hence increasing the risk of Lyme borreliosis in humans.

"A prime goal of regenerative medicine is to direct cell fates in a therapeutically useful manner. Retinitis pigmentosa is one of the most common degenerative diseases of the eye and is associated with early rod photoreceptor death followed by secondary cone degeneration. We hypothesized that converting adult rods into cones, via knockdown of the rod photoreceptor determinant Nrl, could make the cells resistant to the effects of mutations in rod-specific genes, thereby preventing secondary cone loss. To test this idea, we engineered a tamoxifen-inducible allele of Nrl to acutely inactivate the gene in adult rods. This manipulation resulted in reprogramming of rods into cells with a variety of cone-like molecular, histologic, and functional properties. Moreover, reprogramming of adult rods achieved cellular and functional rescue of retinal degeneration in a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa. These findings suggest that elimination of Nrl in adult rods may represent a unique therapy for retinal degeneration.

"Rapid and reliable identification of the vertebrate species on which a disease vector previously parasitized is imperative to study ecological factors that affect pathogen distribution and can aid the development of public health programs. Here we describe a proteome profiling technique designed to identify the source of blood meals of haematophagous arthropods. This method employs direct spectral matching and thus does not require a priori knowledge of any genetic or protein sequence information. Using this technology, we detect remnants of blood in blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and correctly determine the vertebrate species from which the blood was derived, even 6 months after the tick had fed. This biological fingerprinting methodology is sensitive, fast, cost-effective and can potentially be adapted for other biological and medical applications when existing genome-based methods are impractical or ineffective.
"
"Heterogeneities in behaviours of individuals may underpin important processes in evolutionary biology and ecology, including the spread of disease. Modelling approaches can sometimes fail to predict disease spread, which may partly be due to the number of unknown sources of variation in host behaviour. The European badger is a wildlife reservoir for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Britain and Ireland, and individual behaviour has been demonstrated to be an important factor in the spread of bTB among badgers and to cattle. Radio-telemetry devices were deployed on 40 badgers from eight groups to investigate patterns of den (sett) use in a high-density population, where each group had one or two main and three to eight outlier setts in their territory. Badgers were located at their setts for 28 days per season for 1 year to investigate how patterns differed between individuals. Denning behaviour may have a strong influence on contact patterns and the transmission of disease. We found significant heterogeneity, influenced by season, sex and age. Also, when controlling for these, bTB infection status interacting with season was highly correlated with sett use. Test-positive badgers spent more time away from their main sett than those that tested negative. We speculate that wider-ranging behaviour of test-positive animals may result in them contacting sources of infection more frequently and/or that their behaviour may be influenced by their disease status. Measures to control infectious diseases might be improved by targeting functional groups, specific areas or times of year that may contribute disproportionately to disease spread.

"Entomologic investigations were conducted during an intense outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) disease in Maricopa County, Arizona during July 31-August 9, 2010. The investigations compared the East Valley outbreak area, and a demographically similar control area in northwestern metropolitan Phoenix where no human cases were reported. Five mosquito species were identified in each area, and species composition was similar in both areas. Significantly more Culex quinquefasciatus females were collected by gravid traps at Outbreak sites (22.2 per trap night) than at control sites (8.9 per trap night), indicating higher Cx. quinquefasciatus abundance in the outbreak area. Twenty-eight WNV TaqMan reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-positive mosquito pools were identified, including 24 of Cx. quinquefasciatus, 3 of Psorophora columbiae, and 1 of Culex sp. However, Cx. quinquefasciatus WNV infection rates did not differ between outbreak and control sites. At outbreak sites, 30 of 39 engorged Cx. quinquefasciatus had fed on birds, 8 of 39 on humans, and 1 of 39 on a lizard. At control sites, 20 of 20 identified blood meals were from birds. Data suggest that Cx. quinquefasciatus was the primary enzootic and epidemic vector of this outbreak. The most important parameters in the outbreak were vector abundance and blood meal analysis, which suggested more frequent contact between Cx. quinquefasciatus and human hosts in the outbreak area compared with the control area.

"Emerging vector-borne diseases are an important issue in global health. Many vector-borne pathogens have appeared in new regions in the past two decades, while many endemic diseases have increased in incidence. Although introductions and emergence of endemic pathogens are often considered to be distinct processes, many endemic pathogens are actually spreading at a local scale coincident with habitat change. We draw attention to key differences between dynamics and disease burden that result from increased pathogen transmission after habitat change and after introduction into new regions. Local emergence is commonly driven by changes in human factors as much as by enhanced enzootic cycles, whereas pathogen invasion results from anthropogenic trade and travel where and when conditions (eg, hosts, vectors, and climate) are suitable for a pathogen. Once a pathogen is established, ecological factors related to vector characteristics can shape the evolutionary selective pressure and result in increased use of people as transmission hosts. We describe challenges inherent in the control of vector-borne zoonotic diseases and some emerging non-traditional strategies that could be effective in the long term.
"
"Evaluating the permeability of potential barriers to movement, dispersal and gene exchanges can help describe spreading patterns of wildlife diseases. Here, we used landscape genetics methods to assess the genetic structure of the striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), which is a frequent vector of rabies, a lethal zoonosis of great concern for public health. Our main objective was to identify landscape elements shaping the genetic structure of this species in Southern Québec, Canada, in an area where the raccoon rabies variant has been detected. We hypothesised that geographic distance and landscape barriers, such as highways and major rivers, would modulate genetic structure. We genotyped a total of 289 individuals sampled across a large area (22,000 km²) at nice microsatellite loci. Genetic structure analyses identified a single genetic cluster in the study area. Major rivers and highways, however, influenced the genetic relatedness among sampled individuals. Sex-specific analyses revealed that rivers significantly limited dispersal only for females while highways only had marginal effects. Rivers and highways did not significantly affect male dispersal. These results support the contention that female skunks are more philopatric than males. Overall, our results suggest that the effects of major rivers and highways on dispersal are sex-specific and rather weak and are thus unlikely to prevent the spread of rabies within and among striped skunk populations.

"To identify Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis infection in northeastern China, we tested blood samples from 622 febrile patients. We identified in 7 infected patients and natural foci for this bacterium. Field surveys showed that 1.6% of ticks and 3.8% of rodents collected from residences of patients were also infected.

"Olfactory communication is an important aspect of the biology of ground squirrels; accordingly, some of their integumentary glands are associated with scent-marking behavior. Although reports of neoplasms in ground squirrels are limited, the literature on tumors in this family of rodents is extensive, with hepatocellular carcinomas in woodchucks and fibromas in squirrels being the 2 most common neoplasms. Apocrine gland tumors occur frequently in domestic animals such as cats and dogs but to our knowledge have not previously been reported in squirrels. Here we describe 2 cases of adenocarcinoma of the dorsal glands in privately owned European ground squirrels (Spermophilus citellus). The skin nodules were characterized histologically by proliferation of epithelial cells, which were arranged in a tubuloacinar pattern with neoplastic emboli within the blood vessels. Adenocarcinoma of the dorsal glands was diagnosed in light of the anatomic localization, immunohistochemistry results, and histochemistry findings.

"Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) cause many diseases worldwide and their transmission is likely to change with land use and climate changes. La Crosse virus (LACV) is historically transmitted by the native mosquito Aedes triseriatus (Say) in the upper Midwestern US, but the invasive congeners Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and A. japonicus (Theobald), which co-occur with A. triseriatus in water-holding containers, may be important accessory vectors in the Appalachian region where La Crosse encephalitis is an emerging disease. This review focuses on evidence for how climate, land use, and biological invasions may have direct abiotic and indirect community-level impacts on immature developmental stages (eggs and larvae) of Aedes mosquitoes. Because vector-borne diseases usually vary in space and time and are related to the ecology of the vector species, we propose that the ecology of its mosquito vectors, particularly at their immature stages, has played an important role in the emergence of La Crosse encephalitis in the Appalachian region and represents a model for investigating the effects of environmental changes on other vector-borne diseases. We summarize the health effects of LACV and associated socioeconomic costs that make it the most important native mosquito-borne disease in the US. We review of the transmission of LACV, and present evidence for the impacts of climate, land use, and biological invasions on Aedes mosquito communities. Finally, we discuss important questions about the ecology of LACV mosquito vectors that may improve our understanding of the impacts of environmental changes on LACV and other arboviruses.

"Parasites are often aggregated on a minority of the individuals in their host populations. Although host characteristics are commonly presumed to explain parasite aggregation on hosts, spatio-temporal aggregation of parasites during their host-seeking stages may have a dominant effect on the aggregation on hosts. We aimed to quantify, using mixed models, repeatability and autocorrelation analyses, the degree to which the aggregation of blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) on white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) is influenced by spatio-temporal distributions of the host-seeking ticks and by heterogeneity among mice. Host-seeking ticks were spatially aggregated at both the larval and nymphal life-stages. However, this spatial aggregation accounted for little of the variation in larval and nymphal burdens observed on mice (3% and 0%, respectively). Conversely, mouse identity accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in tick burdens. Mouse identity was a significant explanatory factor as the majority of ticks parasitized a consistent set of mice throughout the activity seasons. Of the characteristics associated with mouse identity investigated, only gender affected larval burdens, and body mass and home range sizes in males were correlated with nymphal burdens. These analyses suggest that aggregation of ticks on a minority of mice does not result from the distribution of host-seeking ticks but from characteristics of the hosts.
"
"Identifying natural barriers to movements of hosts associated with infectious diseases is essential for developing effective control strategies. Raccoon rabies variant (RRV) is a zoonosis of concern for humans because its main vector, the raccoon (Procyon lotor), is found near residential areas. In Québec, Canada, all cases of RRV found in raccoons since 2006 were detected on the eastern side of the Richelieu River, suggesting that this river acts as a barrier to gene flow and thus the potential for RRV to spread. The objectives of this study were to characterize the genetic structure of raccoon populations and assess the effect of the Richelieu River on the population structure in southern Québec, Canada. We also evaluated whether RRV spread potential differed between sex and at a larger spatial scale. Our analyses revealed a weak signal of genetic differentiation among individuals located on each side of the Richelieu River. At a larger spatial scale, genetic structuring was weak. Our results suggest that rivers might not always efficiently restrain raccoon movements and spread of RRV. We suggest that the difference in genetic structure found between sexes can be partly explained by male movements during the breeding season in winter, when ice bridges allow passage over most rivers in Québec.
"
"It is well known that parasites are often highly aggregated on their hosts such that relatively few individuals host the large majority of parasites. When the parasites are vectors of infectious disease, a key consequence of this aggregation can be increased disease transmission rates. The cause of this aggregation, however, is much less clear, especially for parasites such as arthropod vectors, which generally spend only a short time on their hosts. Regression-based analyses of ticks on various hosts have focused almost exclusively on identifying the intrinsic host characteristics associated with large burdens, but these efforts have had mixed results; most host traits examined have some small influence, but none are key. An alternative approach, the Poisson-gamma mixture distribution, has often been used to describe aggregated parasite distributions in a range of host/macroparasite systems, but lacks a clear mechanistic basis. Here, we extend this framework by linking it to a general model of parasite accumulation. Then, focusing on blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) on mice (Peromyscus leucopus), we fit the extended model to the best currently available larval tick burden datasets via hierarchical Bayesian methods, and use it to explore the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on observed tick burdens. Our results suggest that simple bad luck-inhabiting a home range with high vector density-may play a much larger role in determining parasite burdens than is currently appreciated.

"A tick survey was conducted to determine the relative abundance and distribution of ticks associated with selected mammals in the Republic of Korea (ROK) during 2008-2009. A total of 918 ticks were collected from 76 mammals (6 families, 9 species) captured at 6 provinces and 3 Metropolitan Cities in ROK. Haemaphysalis longicornis (54.4%) was the most frequently collected tick, followed by Haemaphysalis flava (28.5%), Ixodes nipponensis (7.6%), Ixodes pomerantzevi (4.8%), Ixodes persulcatus (4.6%), and Haemaphysalis japonica (0.1%). Adults (57.0%) and nymphs (28.7%) of Ixodes and Haemaphysalis spp. were collected most frequently from medium or large mammals in this survey, while few larvae (14.3%) were collected. Hydropotes inermis was the most frequently captured mammal (52.6%), with a 16.4 tick index and 5 of 6 species of ticks collected during this survey. H. longicornis (69.7%) was the predominant tick collected from H. inermis, followed by H. flava (22.2%), I. persulcatus (6.1%), I. nipponensis (1.8%), and H. japonica (0.2%).

"Although a large body of literature exists for the environmental risk factors for La Crosse virus (LACV) transmission, the demographic and socioeconomic risk factors for developing LACV infection have not been investigated. Therefore, this study investigated the demographic and socioeconomic risk factors for LACV infection in West Virginia from 2003 to 2007, using two forward stepwise discriminant analyses. The discriminant analyses were used to evaluate a number of demographic and socioeconomic factors for their ability to predict: 1) those census tracts with at least one reported case of LACV infection versus those census tracts with no reported cases of LACV infection and 2) to evaluate significantly high-risk clusters for LACV infection versus significantly low-risk clusters for LACV infection. In the first model, a high school education diploma or a general education diploma or less and a lower housing densitywere found to be predictive of those census tracts with at least one case of LACV infection. A high school or a general education diploma or less, lower housing density, and housing built in 1969 and earlier were all found to be predictive of those census tracts displaying high-risk clusters versus census tracts displaying low-risk clusters in the second model. The cluster discriminant analysis was found to be more predictive than the census tract discriminant analysis as indicated by the Eigenvalues, canonical correlation, and grouping accuracy. The results of this study indicate that socioeconomically disadvantaged populations are at the highest risk for LACV infection and should be a focus of LACV infection prevention efforts.

"Most of sequenced West Nile virus (WNV) genomes encode a single N-linked glycosylation site on their envelope (E) proteins. We previously found that WNV lacking the E protein glycan was severely inhibited in its ability to replicate and spread within two important mosquito vector species, Culex pipiens and Cx. tarsalis. However, recent work with a closely related species, Cx. pipiens pallens, found no association between E protein glycosylation and either replication or dissemination. To examine this finding further, we expanded upon our previous studies to include an additional Culex species, Cx. quinquefasciatus. The non-glycosylated WNV-N154I virus replicated less efficiently in mosquito tissues after intrathoracic inoculation, but there was little difference in replication efficiency in the midgut after peroral infection. Interestingly, although infectivity was inhibited when WNV lacked the E protein glycan, there was little difference in viral spread throughout the mosquito. These data indicate that E protein glycosylation affects WNV-vector interactions in a species-specific manner.

"Anaplasma phagocytophilum persists in nature by cycling between mammals and ticks. Human infection by the bite of an infected tick leads to a potentially fatal emerging disease called human granulocytic anaplasmosis. A. phagocytophilum is an obligatory intracellular bacterium that replicates inside mammalian granulocytes and the salivary gland and midgut cells of ticks. A. phagocytophilum evolved the remarkable ability to hijack the regulatory system of host cells. A. phagocytophilum alters vesicular traffic to create an intracellular membrane-bound compartment that allows replication in seclusion from lysosomes. The bacterium downregulates or actively inhibits a number of innate immune responses of mammalian host cells, and it upregulates cellular cholesterol uptake to acquire cholesterol for survival. It also upregulates several genes critical for the infection of ticks, and it prolongs tick survival at freezing temperatures. Several host factors that exacerbate infection have been identified, including interleukin-8 (IL-8) and cholesterol. Host factors that overcome infection include IL-12 and gamma interferon (IFN-γ). Two bacterial type IV secretion effectors and several bacterial proteins that associate with inclusion membranes have been identified. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying A. phagocytophilum infection will foster the development of creative ideas to prevent or treat this emerging tick-borne disease.

"Over the past years, biodiversity has been reduced on an unprecedented scale, while new infectious diseases are emerging at an increasing rate. Greater overall biodiversity could lead to a greater diversity of hosts and thus of pathogens. Yet disease regulation – due to the buffering role of host diversity – is considered to be one of the services provided by biodiversity. In this chapter, we ask how biodiversity is linked to infectious disease. First, we investigate the influence of the biodiversity of pathogens. We highlight that the number of pathogen species is not well known but that new findings are facilitated by the rapid expansion of molecular techniques. We show that, although there is a trend to find higher pathogen richness toward the equator, identifying a global pattern between the richness of all pathogen species and their latitudinal distribution is challenging. We emphasize that pathogen intraspecific diversity is a crucial factor in disease emergence and allows pathogens to adapt to the selective pressures they face. In addition, the selective pressure acting on hosts due to parasite, and reinforced by parasite diversity within hosts seems to be a major evolutionary and ecological force shaping hosts biodiversity. Second, we investigate how the diversity of hosts influences infectious disease ecology. For multi-host diseases, a change in host species richness or abundance can modify the dynamics of local infectious diseases by either reducing (“dilution effect”) or increasing (“amplification effect”) the risk of transmission to the targeted host species. The underlying hypothesis is that, the competence of reservoirs varies according to the host species. The dilution effect has been demonstrated mainly through theoretical work and there have been only few case studies. Regarding the genetic diversity of host, an important issue is: to what extent does a reduction of this diversity impact the ability of the host population to response to infectious diseases? Third, we rapidly examine the role of biodiversity in the treatment of infectious diseases. To conclude, we consider that the consequences of the loss of species biodiversity on infectious diseases is still largely unknown, notably due to the lack of knowledge on the dynamics of host-pathogen relationships, especially at the population and at the community level.. We highlight that work on multi-host/ ulti-pathogen systems should be fostered and that new approaches, such as metagenomic investigations that does not require a priori assumptions, are promising to describe a community of pathogens and their interactions.

"BACKGROUND: La Crosse virus (LACV) is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in the United States. Since the mid-1980s, the number of reported cases of LACV infection in West Virginia has continued to rise and the state currently reports the most cases in the United States. The purpose of this study was to investigate and describe the spatial epidemiology and clinical presentation of LACV infection cases reported in West Virginia, as well as to provide a description of the environmental conditions present at the residences of the LACV infection cases. METHODS: Descriptive and spatial analyses were performed on LACV infection cases reported to the West Virginia Department of Health from 2003 to 2007. Clinical and environmental variables were available for 96 cases and residence data were available for 68 of these cases. Spatial analyses using the global Moran's I and Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic were performed using the population 15 years and younger at both the county and census tract levels to identify those geographic areas at the highest risk of infection. RESULTS: Two statistically significant (p < 0.05) high-risk clusters, involving six counties, were detected at the county level. At the census tract level, one statistically significant high-risk cluster involving 41 census tracts spanning over six counties was identified. The county level cumulative incidence for those counties in the primary high-risk cluster ranged from 100.0 to 189.0 cases per 100,000 persons (median 189.0) and the census tract level cumulative incidence for those counties in the high-risk cluster ranged from 61.7 to 505.9 cases per 100,000 persons (median 99.0). The counties and census tracts within high-risk clusters had a relative risk four to nine times higher when compared to those areas not contained within high-risk clusters. The majority of LACV infection cases were reported during the summer months in children 15 years and younger. Fever, vomiting, photophobia, and nausea were the most commonly reported signs and symptoms. A case fatality rate (CFR) of 3.1% was observed. Wooded areas and containers were present at the majority of case residences. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidences of LACV infection from 2003 to 2007 were considerably higher than previously reported for West Virginia, and statistically significant high-risk clusters for LACV infection were detected at both the county and census tract levels. The finding of a high CFR and the identification of those areas at highest risk for infection will be useful for guiding future research and intervention efforts.

"This introduction to the themed issue on Evolutionary and ecological approaches to the study of personality provides an overview of conceptual, theoretical and methodological progress in research on animal personalities over the last decade, and places the contributions to this volume in context. The issue has three main goals. First, we aimed to bring together theoreticians to contribute to the development of models providing adaptive explanations for animal personality that could guide empiricists, and stimulate exchange of ideas between the two groups of researchers. Second, we aimed to stimulate cross-fertilization between different scientific fields that study personality, namely behavioural ecology, psychology, genomics, quantitative genetics, neuroendocrinology and developmental biology. Third, we aimed to foster the application of an evolutionary framework to the study of personality.

"The ecological factors responsible for the evolution of individual differences in animal personality (consistent individual differences in the same behaviour across time and contexts) are currently the subject of intense debate. A limited number of ecological factors have been investigated to date, with most attention focusing on the roles of resource competition and predation. We suggest here that parasitism may play a potentially important, but largely overlooked, role in the evolution of animal personalities. We identify two major routes by which parasites might influence the evolution of animal personality. First, because the risk of acquiring parasites can be influenced by an individual's behavioural type, local parasite regimes may impose selection on personality traits and behavioural syndromes (correlations between personality traits). Second, because parasite infections have consequences for aspects of host 'state', parasites might induce the evolution of individual differences in certain types of host behaviour in populations with endemic infections. Also, because infection often leads to specific changes in axes of personality, parasite infections have the potential to decouple behavioural syndromes. Host-parasite systems therefore provide researchers with valuable tools to study personality variation and behavioural syndromes from a proximate and ultimate perspective.

"The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), is an important vector of a number of arboviruses, and populations exhibit extreme variation in adaptive traits such as egg diapause, cold hardiness, and autogeny (ability to mature a batch of eggs without blood feeding). The genetic basis of some of these traits has been established, but lack of a high-resolution linkage map has prevented in-depth genetic analyses of the genes underlying these complex traits. We report here on the breeding of 4 F(1) intercross mapping families and the use of these to locate 35 cDNA markers to the A. albopictus linkage map. The present study increases the number of markers on the A. albopictus cDNA linkage map from 38 to 73 and the density of markers from 1 marker/5.7 cM to 1 marker/2.9 cM and adds 9, 16, and 10 markers to the 3 linkage groups, respectively. The overall lengths of the 3 linkage groups are 64.5, 76.5, and 71.6 cM, respectively, for a combined length of 212.6 cM. Despite conservation in the order of most genes among the 4 families and a previous mapping family, we found substantial heterogeneity in the amount of recombination among markers. This was most marked in linkage group I, which varied between 16.7 and 69.3 cM. A map integrating the results from these 4 families with an earlier cDNA linkage map is presented.

"Identifying factors affecting individual vector burdens is essential for understanding infectious disease systems. Drawing upon data of a rodent monitoring programme conducted in nine different forest patches in southern Hesse, Germany, we developed models which predict tick (Ixodes spp. and Dermacentor spp.) burdens on two rodent species Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus. Models for the two rodent species were broadly similar but differed in some aspects. Patterns of Ixodes spp. burdens were influenced by extrinsic factors such as season, unexplained spatial variation (both species), relative humidity and vegetation cover (A. flavicollis). We found support for the 'body mass' (tick burdens increase with body mass/age) and for the 'dilution' hypothesis (tick burdens decline with increasing rodent densities) and little support for the 'sex-bias' hypothesis (both species). Surprisingly, roe deer densities were not correlated with larvae counts on rodents. Factors influencing the mean burden did not significantly explain the observed dispersion of tick counts. Co-feeding aggregations, which are essential for tick-borne disease transmission, were mainly found in A. flavicollis of high body mass trapped in areas with fast increase in spring temperatures. Locally, Dermacentor spp. appears to be an important parasite on A. flavicollis and M. glareolus. Dermacentor spp. was rather confined to areas with higher average temperatures during the vegetation period. Nymphs of Dermacentor spp. mainly fed on M. glareolus and were seldom found on A. flavicollis. Whereas Ixodes spp. is the dominant tick genus in woodlands of our study area, the distribution and epidemiological role of Dermacentor spp. should be monitored closely.

"Cone vision is less sensitive than rod vision. Much of this difference can be attributed to the photoreceptors themselves, but the reason why the cones are less sensitive is still unknown. Recent recordings indicate that one important factor may be a difference in the rate of activation of cone transduction; that is, the rising phase of the cone response per bleached rhodopsin molecule (Rh*) has a smaller slope than the rising phase of the rod response per Rh*, perhaps because some step between Rh* and activation of the phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) effector molecule occurs with less gain. Since rods and cones have different G-protein alpha subunits, and since this subunit (Talpha) plays a key role both in the interaction of G-protein with Rh* and the activation of PDE6, we investigated the mechanism of the amplification difference by expressing cone Talpha in rod Talpha-knockout rods to produce so-called GNAT2C mice. We show that rods in GNAT2C mice have decreased sensitivity and a rate of activation half that of wild-type (WT) mouse rods. Furthermore, GNAT2C responses recover more rapidly than WT responses with kinetic parameters resembling those of native mouse cones. Our results show for the first time that part of the difference in sensitivity and response kinetics between rods and cones may be the result of a difference in the G-protein alpha subunit. They also indicate more generally that the molecular nature of G-protein alpha may play an important role in the kinetics of G-protein cascades for metabotropic receptors throughout the body.
"
"The remarkable ability of our vision to function under ever-changing conditions of ambient illumination is mediated by multiple molecular mechanisms regulating the light sensitivity of rods and cones. One such mechanism involves massive translocation of signaling proteins, including the G-protein transducin, into and out of the light-sensitive photoreceptor outer segment compartment. Transducin translocation extends the operating range of rods, but in cones transducin never translocates, which is puzzling because cones typically function in much brighter light than rods. Using genetically manipulated mice in which the rates of transducin activation and inactivation were altered, we demonstrate that, like in rods, transducin translocation in cones can be triggered when transducin activation exceeds a critical level, essentially saturating the photoresponse. However, this level is never achieved in wild-type cones: their superior ability to tightly control the rates of transducin activation and inactivation, responsible for avoiding saturation by light, also accounts for the prevention of transducin translocation at any light intensity.

"BACKGROUND: Focal arboviral infections affecting a subset of the overall population present an often overlooked set of challenges in the assessment and reporting of risk and the detection of spatial patterns. Our objective was to assess the variation in risk when using different at-risk populations and geographic scales for the calculation of incidence risk and the detection of geographic hot-spots of infection. We explored these variations using a pediatric arbovirus, La Crosse virus (LACV), as our model. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Descriptive and cluster analyses were performed on probable and confirmed cases of LACV infections reported to the Tennessee Department of Health from 1997 to 2006, using three at-risk populations (the total population, the population 18 years and younger, and the population 15 years and younger) and at two geographic levels (county and census tract) to assess the variation in incidence risk and to investigate evidence of clustering using both global and local spatial statistics. We determined that the most appropriate at-risk population to calculate incidence risk and to assess the evidence of clustering was the population 15 years and younger. Based on our findings, the most appropriate geographical level to conduct spatial analyses and report incidence risk is the census tract level. The incidence risk in the population 15 years and younger at the county level ranged from 0 to 226.5 per 100,000 persons (median 41.5) in those counties reporting cases (n = 14) and at the census tract level it ranged from 50.9 to 673.9 per 100,000 persons (median 126.7) in those census tracts reporting cases (n = 51). To our knowledge, this is the highest reported incidence risk for this population at the county level for Tennessee and at the census tract level nationally. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate the possibility of missing disease clusters resulting from performing incidence risk investigations of focal diseases using inappropriate at-risk populations and/or at large geographic scales. Improved disease surveillance and health planning will result through the use of well defined at-risk populations and the use of appropriate geographic scales for the analysis and reporting of diseases. The finding of a high incidence risk of LACV infections in eastern Tennessee demonstrates that the vast majority of these infections continue to be under-diagnosed and/or underreported in this region. Persistent prevention and surveillance efforts will be required to reduce exposure to infectious vectors and to detect new cases of infection in this region. Application of this study's observations in future investigations will enhance the quantification of incidence risk and the identification of high-risk groups within the population.

"Vectors of infectious diseases are generally thought to be regulated by abiotic conditions such as climate or the availability of specific hosts or habitats. In this study we tested whether blacklegged ticks, the vectors of Lyme disease, granulocytic anaplasmosis and babesiosis can be regulated by the species of vertebrate hosts on which they obligately feed. By subjecting field-caught hosts to parasitism by larval blacklegged ticks, we found that some host species (e.g. opossums, squirrels) that are abundantly parasitized in nature kill 83-96% of the ticks that attempt to attach and feed, while other species are more permissive of tick feeding. Given natural tick burdens we document on these hosts, we show that some hosts can kill thousands of ticks per hectare. These results indicate that the abundance of tick vectors can be regulated by the identity of the hosts upon which these vectors feed. By simulating the removal of hosts from intact communities using empirical models, we show that the loss of biodiversity may exacerbate disease risk by increasing both vector numbers and vector infection rates with a zoonotic pathogen.

"The primary cause of tick-borne relapsing fever in western North America is Borrelia hermsii, a rodent-associated spirochete transmitted by the fast-feeding soft tick Ornithodoros hermsi. We describe a patient who had an illness consistent with relapsing fever after exposure in the mountains near Los Angeles, California, USA. The patient's convalescent-phase serum was seropositive for B. hermsii but negative for several other vector-borne bacterial pathogens. Investigations at the exposure site showed the presence of O. hermsi ticks infected with B. hermsii and the presence of rodents that were seropositive for the spirochete. We determined that this tick-borne disease is endemic to the San Gabriel Mountains near the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area.

"West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus (Flaviviridae) transmitted between Culex spp. mosquitoes and avian hosts. The virus has dramatically expanded its geographic range in the past ten years. Increases in global commerce, climate change, ecological factors and the emergence of novel viral genotypes likely play significant roles in the emergence of this virus; however, the exact mechanism and relative importance of each is uncertain. Previously WNV was primarily associated with febrile illness of children in endemic areas, but it was identified as a cause of neurological disease in humans in 1994. This modulation in disease presentation could be the result of the emergence of a more virulent genotype as well as the progression of the virus into areas in which the age structure of immunologically naïve individuals makes them more susceptible to severe neurological disease. Since its introduction to North America in 1999, a novel WNV genotype has been identified that has been demonstrated to disseminate more rapidly and with greater efficiency at elevated temperatures than the originally introduced strain, indicating the potential importance of temperature as a selective criteria for the emergence of WNV genotypes with increased vectorial capacity. Even prior to the North American introduction, a mutation associated with increased replication in avian hosts, identified to be under adaptive evolutionary pressure, has been identified, indicating that adaptation for increased replication within vertebrate hosts could play a role in increased transmission efficiency. Although stable in its evolutionary structure, WNV has demonstrated the capacity for rapidly adapting to both vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors and will likely continue to exploit novel ecological niches as it adapts to novel transmission foci.

"Prevention is the best method for avoiding potentially serious complications of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. In this article, we discuss preventative measures that can be used by individuals or communities. Among the topics discussed are personal protective measures, tick reduction, reservoir reduction, and vaccination. Additionally, new preventative measures that are in development-including new Lyme disease vaccines, antitick vaccines, and reservoir-targeted vaccination-are discussed.
"
"Fevers of unknown origin have been classified as classic, nosocomial, immune-deficient, and HIV-related. More than half of the 1407 human pathogens are zoonotic, making zoonotic infections an important subcategory in each of the classifications. This article describes both common and unusual zoonoses causing fevers of unknown origin. Simian immune virus is considered as a possible emerging infection. For special populations (the homeless, zoophiliacs, those whose occupation or leisure brings them in close contact with oceans or lakes, and veterinarians), zoonotic infection potentials are discussed.
"
"Emerging zoonotic pathogens are a constant threat to human health throughout the world. Control strategies to protect public health regularly fail, due in part to the tendency to focus on a single host species assumed to be the primary reservoir for a pathogen. Here, we present evidence that a diverse set of species can play an important role in determining disease risk to humans using Lyme disease as a model. Host-targeted public health strategies to control the Lyme disease epidemic in North America have focused on interrupting Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) transmission between blacklegged ticks and the putative dominant reservoir species, white-footed mice. However, B. burgdorferi ss infects more than a dozen vertebrate species, any of which could transmit the pathogen to feeding ticks and increase the density of infected ticks and Lyme disease risk. Using genetic and ecological data, we demonstrate that mice are neither the primary host for ticks nor the primary reservoir for B. burgdorferi ss, feeding 10% of all ticks and 25% of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. Inconspicuous shrews feed 35% of all ticks and 55% of infected ticks. Because several important host species influence Lyme disease risk, interventions directed at a multiple host species will be required to control this epidemic.

"In order to investigate the prevalence of tick-borne infectious agents among ticks, ticks comprising five species from two genera (Hemaphysalis spp. and Ixodes spp.) were screened using molecular techniques. Ticks (3,135) were collected from small wild-caught mammals or by dragging/flagging in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and were pooled into a total of 1,638 samples (1 to 27 ticks per pool). From the 1,638 tick samples, species-specific fragments of Anaplasma phagocytophilum (1 sample), Anaplasma platys (52 samples), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (29 samples), Ehrlichia ewingii (2 samples), Ehrlichia canis (18 samples), and Rickettsia rickettsii (28 samples) were amplified by PCR assay. Twenty-one pooled and individual tick samples had mixed infections of two (15 samples) or three (6 samples) pathogens. In addition, 424 spleen samples from small captured mammals (389 rodents, 33 insectivores, and 2 weasels) were screened for selected zoonotic pathogens. Species-specific DNA fragments of A. phagocytophilum (110 samples), A. platys (68 samples), E. chaffeensis (8 samples), E. ewingii (26 samples), E. canis (51 samples), and Rickettsia sp. (22 samples) were amplified by PCR assay. One hundred thirty small mammals had single infections, while 4, 14, and 21 striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) had mixed infections of four, three, and two pathogens, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequence comparison also revealed that Korean strains of E. chaffeensis clustered closely with those from China and the United States, while the Rickettsia (rOmpA) sequences clustered within a clade together with a Chinese strain. These results suggest that these agents should be considered in differential diagnosis while examining cases of acute febrile illnesses in humans as well as animals in the ROK.
"
"Risk of human exposure to vector-borne zoonotic pathogens is a function of the abundance and infection prevalence of vectors. We assessed the determinants of Lyme-disease risk (density and Borrelia burgdorferi-infection prevalence of nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks) over 13 y on several field plots within eastern deciduous forests in the epicenter of US Lyme disease (Dutchess County, New York). We used a model comparison approach to simultaneously test the importance of ambient growing-season temperature, precipitation, two indices of deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance, and densities of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and acorns (Quercus spp.), in both simple and multiple regression models, in predicting entomological risk. Indices of deer abundance had no predictive power, and precipitation in the current year and temperature in the prior year had only weak effects on entomological risk. The strongest predictors of a current year's risk were the prior year's abundance of mice and chipmunks and abundance of acorns 2 y previously. In no case did inclusion of deer or climate variables improve the predictive power of models based on rodents, acorns, or both. We conclude that interannual variation in entomological risk of exposure to Lyme disease is correlated positively with prior abundance of key hosts for the immature stages of the tick vector and with critical food resources for those hosts.
"
"We examined the degree of host specialization of different strains of Borrelia burgdorferi, the tickborne pathogen that causes Lyme borreliosis in the northeastern United States. We first assessed the genetic population structures of B. burgdorferi in ticks obtained from different mammalian host species and in questing ticks sampled in a woodland ecosystem in Connecticut. By comparing the patterns found in our study with data from another cross-sectional study, we demonstrate that B. burgdorferi is a generalist microparasite and conclude that efficient cross-species transmission of B. burgdorferi is a key feature that has allowed the rapid spread of Lyme borreliosis across the northeastern United States.
"
"When a species is introduced into a new location, it may escape, at least temporarily, from its natural enemies. In field surveys, we found that when the exotic, invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, invades new sites, it initially experiences reduced infection by its gut parasite, Ascogregarina taiwanensis. To determine the effect of this escape from parasitism on the competitive ability of A. albopictus, we performed a laboratory competition experiment in which infected and uninfected A. albopictus larvae were reared in microcosms alone and in competition with larvae of the native mosquito, Ochlerotatus triseriatus. We analyzed the effect of parasitism by A. taiwanensis on A. albopictus performance when subjected to intra- and interspecific competition across a range of larval densities, as well as the effect of A. albopictus parasitism by A. taiwanensis on the competitive impact of A. albopictus on O. triseriatus. At a density of 30 O. triseriatus larvae, O. triseriatus survivorship was significantly reduced by the addition of 30 unifected A. albopictus, but not by addition of 30 infected A. albopictus, and not by addition of 15 A. albopictus whether infected or uninfected. Although estimated finite rate of population increase (λ') showed similar trends, and was significantly affected by treatments, no pairwise differences in rate of increase were significant. Infection by A. taiwanensis also significantly prolonged A. albopictus female development time and reduced the intraspecific competitive effect of increased density of A. albopictus, but did not affect A. albopictus survivorship, mass, or estimated finite rate of population increase. Thus, when A. albopictus escapes from this parasite as it colonizes new sites, this escape may give it a small, but significant, added competitive advantage over O. triseriatus, which may facilitate range expansion of A. albopictus and enhance A. albopictus's initial impact on resident species.

"Primers were used to amplify a 561-bp region of the 16S rRNA gene of Ehrlichia phagocytophila from Ixodes scapularis ticks and small mammals collected in Rhode Island and Connecticut. DNA sequences for all 50 E. phagocytophila-positive samples collected from 1996 through 1998 in southwestern Connecticut were identical to the sequence reported for E. phagocytophila DNA from confirmed human cases. In contrast, the sequences from 92 of 123 E. phagocytophila-positive Rhode Island samples collected from 1996 through 1999 included several variants differing by 1-2 nucleotides from that in the agent infecting humans. While 11.9% of 67 E. phagocytophila-positive ticks collected during 1997 in Rhode Island harbored ehrlichiae with sequences identical to that of the human agent, 79.1% had a variant sequence not previously described. The low incidence of human ehrlichiosis in Rhode Island may in part result from interference by these variant ehrlichiae with maintenance and transmission of the true agent of human disease.

"Cryptosporidium, an enteric parasite of humans and a wide range of other mammals, presents numerous challenges to the supply of safe drinking water. We performed a wildlife survey, focusing on white-tailed deer and small mammals, to assess whether they may serve as environmental sources of Cryptosporidium. A PCR-based approach that permitted genetic characterization via sequence analysis was applied to wildlife fecal samples (n = 111) collected from September 1996 to July 1998 from three areas in lower New York State. Southern analysis revealed 22 fecal samples containing Cryptosporidium small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal DNA; these included 10 of 91 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) samples, 3 of 5 chipmunk (Tamias striatus) samples, 1 of 2 white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) samples, 1 of 2 striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis) samples, 1 of 5 racoon (Procyon lotor) samples, and 6 of 6 muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) samples. All of the 15 SSU PCR products sequenced were characterized as Cryptosporidium parvum; two were identical to genotype 2 (bovine), whereas the remainder belonged to two novel SSU sequence groups, designated genotypes 3 and 4. Genotype 3 comprised four deer-derived sequences, whereas genotype 4 included nine sequences from deer, mouse, chipmunk, and muskrat samples. PCR analysis was performed on the SSU-positive fecal samples for three other Cryptosporidium loci (dihydrofolate reductase, polythreonine-rich protein, and beta-tubulin), and 8 of 10 cloned PCR products were consistent with C. parvum genotype 2. These data provide evidence that there is sylvatic transmission of C. parvum involving deer and other small mammals. This study affirmed the importance of wildlife as potential sources of Cryptosporidium in the catchments of public water supplies.

"White-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, were captured in southern Connecticut during 1997 and 1998 to determine the prevalence of infections caused by granulocytic Ehrlichia sp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and Babesia microti. Of the 50 mice captured and recaptured, 25 of 47 (53.2%) and 23 of 48 (47.9%) contained antibodies to the BDS or NCH-1 Ehrlichia strains, respectively, as determined by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) staining methods. The majority (83.3%) of 48 mice also contained antibodies to B. burgdorferi, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, 20 of 26 (76.9%) contained antibodies to B. microti by IFA staining methods. In nested PCR tests using the 16S rRNA gene, the DNA of the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) agent was detected in 17 of 47 mice (36.2%), but only 4 (23.5%) of these 17 mice were PCR positive at each capture. Antibody-positive reactions to granulocytic Ehrlichia sp. organisms were detected in 17 of 23 (73. 9%) of the PCR-positive mice. The sequences from PCR products from nine positive blood samples were identical to the HGE agent. Ehrlichia spp. were cultured from three of five mice captured in April 1998, including one that was PCR positive in April 1997. In addition, 2 of 14 larval Ixodes scapularis pools, which were attached to two PCR-positive mice, contained DNA of the HGE agent. A high percentage of white-footed mice are infected or have been infected naturally by the HGE agent with low-level persistent infection or frequent reinfection in some individual mice. However, the changes noted in the presence of DNA and antibodies in repeated blood and serum samples from individual mice over several months of field collection suggests that infection with granulocytic Ehrlichia is transient in most wild P. leucopus.

"Rickettsia rickettsii, the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, was lethal for the majority of experimentally and transovarially infected Rocky Mountain wood ticks (Dermacentor andersoni). Overall, 94.1% of nymphs infected as larvae by feeding on rickettsemic guinea pigs died during the molt into adults and 88. 3% of adult female ticks infected as nymphs died prior to feeding. In contrast, only 2.8% of uninfected larvae failed to develop into adults over two generations. Infected female ticks incubated at 4 degreesC had a lower mortality (80.9%) than did those held at 21 degreesC (96.8%). Rickettsiae were vertically transmitted to 39.0% of offspring, and significantly fewer larvae developed from infected ticks. The lethal effect of R. rickettsii may explain the low prevalence of infected ticks in nature and affect its enzootic maintenance.

"In late summer and fall 1997, Aedes albopictus mosquitoes were found in Peoria, Illinois, a long recognized focus of La Crosse virus transmission. Larvae were found in tires and other artificial containers, biting adults were recovered, and eggs were collected in oviposition traps within a 25-ha area. One chipmunk trapped < 0.25 km from the infested area tested positive for neutralizing antibodies against La Crosse virus.

"Borrelia spirochetes were isolated from the adult ixodid tick (Ixodes persulcatus) in three areas of far eastern Russia, namely, Khabarovsk, Vladivostok, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Borrelia infective rates of ticks in those areas were 24.5, 41.4, and 25.1%, respectively (total rate was 26.6%). Spirochetes were also isolated from the tissues of small mammals captured at Khabarovsk (infective rate was 20.8%). Samples were classified by rRNA gene restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The isolated spirochetes from ticks were classified mainly RFLP ribotype group IV (B. garinii), followed by groups II (B. garinii), III (B. afzelii), and V (B. garinii), showing that B. garinii is a dominant species among them. Both B. garinii and B. afzelii were also found in rodents, and multiple infections with those two species were observed in some rodents. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (group I) was not isolated from either ticks or rodents.

"La Crosse virus causes a highly cytopathic infection in cultured cells and in the murine central nervous system (CNS), with widespread neuronal destruction. In some viral infections of the CNS, apoptosis, or programmed cell death, has been proposed as a mechanism for cytopathology (Y. Shen and T. E. Shenk, Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 5:105-111, 1995). To determine whether apoptosis plays a role in La Crosse virus-induced cell death, we performed experiments with newborn mice and two neural tissue culture models. Newborn mice infected with La Crosse virus showed evidence of apoptosis with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nicked-end labeling (TUNEL) assay and, concomitantly, histopathological suggestion of neuronal dropout. Infection of tissue culture cells also resulted in DNA fragmentation, TUNEL reactivity, and morphological changes in the nuclei characteristic of apoptotic cells. As in one other system (S. Ubol, P. C. Tucker, D. E. Griffin, and J. M. Hardwick, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91:5202-5206, 1994), expression of the human proto-oncogene bcl-2 was able to protect one neuronal cell line, N18-RE-105, from undergoing apoptosis after La Crosse virus infection and prolonged the survival of infected cells. Nevertheless, expression of bcl-2 did not prevent eventual cytopathicity. However, a human neuronal cell line, NT2N, was resistant to both apoptosis and other types of cytopathicity after infection with La Crosse virus, reaffirming the complexity of cell death. Our results show that apoptosis is an important consequence of La Crosse virus infection in vivo and in vitro.

"Forty-four files of cats diagnosed as having feline leprosy were reviewed. All except one were from along the Pacific coast in the Province of British Columbia. The majority of cats were between one and three years of age and there was an increase in the number of diagnosis during the winter months.Two types of granulomatous responses similar to the tuberculoid and lepromatous phases of human leprosy were recognized. In spite of the overall similarities in the cellular response to human leprosy there were, however, significant differences such as areas of caseous necrosis and constant lack of nerve involvement. Still as there is presently no way to prove that Mycobacterium leprae is not the cause of feline leprosy the public health significance remains uncertainThe treatment of choice would appear to be surgical removal.

"The arthropod-borne encephalitides are an important cause of equine and human morbidity in the Americas. Between 1975 and 1978, 6970 human cases of arboviral encephalitis were reported in the United States of America; however, this represents only a fraction of the true incidence. St Louis encephalitis (4824 cases), California encephalitis (1035 cases), and western equine encephalitis (WEE, 947 cases) accounted for 98.5% of all reported infections. Approximately 1000-4000 cases of equine encephalitis occur annually in the United States, the majority due to WEE. In tropical America, important outbreaks of Venezuelan, eastern, and western equine encephalitis, and of Rocio encephalitis have occurred.In this article, epidemiological aspects of arboviral encephalitis outbreaks occurring within the past 5 years are reviewed. In addition, summaries of current research activities on the ecology and epidemiology of St Louis, western equine, Venezuelan equine, Rocio, and California encephalitis viruses are presented, and the problem of control of these infections is discussed.

"Arsenic (As) toxicity has deleterious effects on human health causing disorder in the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible neuroprotective effect of resveratrol (RSV) on arsenic-induced neurotoxicity in rats. Neurotoxicity in rats was developed by treating As 10 mg/kg/day for 21 days orally. Animals were put into seven groups: control, vehicle, As, As+RSV10, As+RSV20 mg/kg, RSV10, and RSV20 mg/kg. Behavioral assessments such as the social interaction test, novel object recognition test, elevated plus maze, open field, the Morris water maze, in addition to assessment of biomarkers such as ferric reducing ability of plasma assay, glutathione assay, and malondialdehyde assay, were used to evaluate the effects of RSV on cognitive impairment and molecular changes induced by As. The results showed that cognitive performance impaired in As rats. RSV20 mg/kg significantly could ameliorate behavioral changes like spatial learning in days 3 and 4 (p < 0.05), recognition learning and memory (p < 0.01), disabilities in motor coordination and stress (p < 0.05), increased anxiety (p < 0.05), and social interaction deficit (sociability (p < 0.001) and social memory (p < 0.05)). RSV20 mg/kg also attenuated molecular modifications like decreased antioxidant power (p < 0.001), reduced glutathione content (p < 0.05), and increased malondialdehyde level (p < 0.05) induced by As. In addition to oxidative stress assessments, RSV10 mg/kg could significantly increase FRAP (p < 0.01) and GSH (p < 0.05); however, MDA was not significantly increased. Our current behavioral findings suggest that RSV has neuroprotective effects against AS toxicity.

"The co-evolution of gut microbes and the host plays a vital role in the survival and reproduction of the host. The dhole (Cuon alpinus) has been listed as endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; therefore, conservation and effective breeding of dholes are essential. Effective estrus can promote reproduction. However, little is known about the relative contribution of estrus in shaping the structure and the functions of fecal microbiota. Here, we investigated the potential association between estrus and the fecal microbiota in dholes using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that the estrus stages in dholes vary significantly in terms of gut bacterial composition and microbiome metabolism and function. Compared with that of non-estrus, adult dholes, the microbiome of estrus adult dholes had a significantly higher abundance of Bacillus faecalis and Veillonella, which play a key role in the synthesis of sex hormones and nucleic acids, energy production, and reproductive cell division. The insulin and energy metabolism-related pathways are significantly enhanced in the gut microbes and the related gluconeogenic enzymes are significantly enriched during estrus. These findings suggest that the structure and metagenome of the fecal microbiome during estrus have a significant effect in promoting estrus in dholes, thus providing a new perspective for dhole conservation.

"The previous genetic characterization of the honeybee population of Mauritius Island (Indian Ocean) revealed an ongoing process of hybridization between the first established African subspecies Apis mellifera unicolor and recently imported European subspecies (A. m. ligustica, A. m. carnica and A. m. mellifera). This context offers the rare opportunity to explore the influence of hybridization between African and European honeybees on phenotypic traits out of the case largely studied of the Africanized honeybee (hybrid between A. m. scutellata from South Africa and European subspecies). We thus conducted geometric morphometric analyses on forewings of 283 workers genetically characterized at 14 microsatellite loci to evaluate (1) if the morphological variability coincides well with the neutral genetic variability, (2) if hybrids exhibited rather parental, intermediate or transgressive traits, and (3) to test if fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of size and shape, as a measure of developmental stability, was elevated in hybrids (due to genetic stress) and/or European bees (due to unsuitable environment) compared to African bees. A strong concordance was found between morphological variability and neutral genetic variability, especially for wing shape, based on partial least-square analyses (PLS). However, on average, the morphology of hybrids was more similar to the African bees, potentially reflecting the dynamics and direction of introgression. Significant FA for wing size as well as wing shape was detected, suggesting the overall presence of stress during the development of the studied individuals. In contrast, the asymmetry levels do not differ according to the ancestry (African, European or hybrid) of the individuals. Therefore, if ongoing hybridization contributed to increasing the genetic and phenotypic diversity of the populations and influences its adaptive potential, developmental stressors could not be identified and their evolutionary consequences remain uncertain.

"Developmental plasticity refers to the property by which the same genotype produces distinct phenotypes depending on the environmental conditions under which development takes place. By allowing organisms to produce phenotypes adjusted to the conditions that adults will experience, developmental plasticity can provide the means to cope with environmental heterogeneity. Developmental plasticity can be adaptive and its evolution can be shaped by natural selection. It has also been suggested that developmental plasticity can facilitate adaptation and promote diversification. Here, we summarize current knowledge on the evolution of plasticity and on the impact of plasticity on adaptive evolution, and we identify recent advances and important open questions about the genomics of developmental plasticity in animals. We give special attention to studies using transcriptomics to identify genes whose expression changes across developmental environments and studies using genetic mapping to identify loci that contribute to variation in plasticity and can fuel its evolution.

"Diffusion MR tractography permits investigating the 3D structure of cortical pathways as interwoven paths across the entire brain. We use high-resolution scans from diffusion spectrum imaging and high angular resolution diffusion imaging to investigate the evolution of cortical pathways within the euarchontoglire (i.e., primates, rodents) lineage. More specifically, we compare cortical fiber pathways between macaques (Macaca mulatta), marmosets (Callithrix jachus), and rodents (mice, Mus musculus). We integrate these observations with comparative analyses of Neurofilament heavy polypeptide (NEFH) expression across the cortex of mice and primates. We chose these species because their phylogenetic position serves to trace the early evolutionary history of the human brain. Our comparative analysis from diffusion MR tractography, cortical white matter scaling, and NEFH expression demonstrates that the examined primates deviate from mice in possessing increased long-range cross-cortical projections, many of which course across the anterior to posterior axis of the cortex. Our study shows that integrating gene expression data with diffusion MR data is an effective approach in identifying variation in connectivity patterns between species. The expansion of corticocortical pathways and increased anterior to posterior cortical integration can be traced back to an extension of neurogenetic schedules during development in primates.

"Microbial communities play an important role in organismal and ecosystem health. While high-throughput metabarcoding has revolutionized the study of bacterial communities, generating comparable viral communities has proven elusive, particularly in wildlife samples where the diversity of viruses and limited quantities of viral nucleic acid present distinctive challenges. Metagenomic sequencing is a promising solution for studying viral communities, but the lack of standardized methods currently precludes comparisons across host taxa or localities. Here, we developed an untargeted shotgun metagenomic sequencing protocol to generate comparable viral communities from noninvasively collected faecal and oropharyngeal swabs. Using samples from common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus), a key species for virus transmission to humans and domestic animals, we tested how different storage media, nucleic acid extraction procedures and enrichment steps affect viral community detection. Based on finding viral contamination in foetal bovine serum, we recommend storing swabs in RNAlater or another nonbiological medium. We recommend extracting nucleic acid directly from swabs rather than from supernatant or pelleted material, which had undetectable levels of viral RNA. Results from a low-input RNA library preparation protocol suggest that ribosomal RNA depletion and light DNase treatment reduce host and bacterial nucleic acid, and improve virus detection. Finally, applying our approach to twelve pooled samples from seven localities in Peru, we showed that detected viral communities saturated at the attained sequencing depth, allowing unbiased comparisons of viral community composition. Future studies using the methods outlined here will elucidate the determinants of viral communities across host species, environments and time.

"In the north-central United States, the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is currently known to vector seven human pathogens. These include five bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia mayonii, Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia muris eauclairensis), one protozoan (Babesia microti) and one virus (Powassan). We sought to assess the prevalence and distribution of these pathogens in host-seeking nymphs collected throughout Minnesota, a state on the northwestern edge of the tick's expanding range, where reported cases of I. scapularis-borne diseases have increased in incidence and geographic range over the past decade. Among the 1240 host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs that we screened from 64 sites, we detected all seven pathogens at varying frequencies. Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. was the most prevalent and geographically widespread, found in 25.24% of all nymphs tested. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti were also geographically widespread, but they were less prevalent than Bo. burgdorferi s.s. (detected in 6.29% and 4.68% of ticks, respectively). Spatial clusters of sites with high prevalence for these three pathogens were identified in the north-central region of the state. Prevalence was less than 1.29% for each of the remaining pathogens. Two or more pathogens were detected in 90 nymphs (7.26%); coinfections with Bo. burgdorferi s.s. and either A. phagocytophilum (51 nymphs, 4.11%) or Ba. microti (43 nymphs, 3.47%) were the most common combinations. The distribution and density of infected ticks mirrors the distribution of notifiable tick-borne diseases in Minnesota and provides information on the distribution and prevalence of recently described human pathogens.

"In the United States, the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is a vector of seven human pathogens, including those causing Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, Borrelia miyamotoi disease, Powassan virus disease, and ehrlichiosis associated with Ehrlichia muris eauclarensis. In addition to an accelerated rate of discovery of I. scapularis-borne pathogens over the past two decades, the geographic range of the tick, and incidence and range of I. scapularis-borne disease cases, have increased. Despite knowledge of when and where humans are most at risk of exposure to infected ticks, control of I. scapularis-borne diseases remains a challenge. Human vaccines are not available, and we lack solid evidence for other prevention and control methods to reduce human disease. The way forward is discussed.

"Little is known of how the stress response varies when animals confront seasonal life-history processes. Antioxidant defenses and damage caused by oxidative stress and their link with immunocompetence are powerful biomarkers to assess animal´s physiological stress response. The aim of this study was A) to determine redox state and variation in basal (pre-acute stress) immune function during summer, autumn and winter (spring was not assessed due to restrictions in collecting permit) in the fish-eating Myotis (Myotis vivesi; Chiroptera), and B) to determine the effect of acute stress on immunocompetence and redox state during each season. Acute stress was stimulated by restricting animal movement for 6 and 12 h. The magnitude of the cellular immune response was higher during winter whilst that of the humoral response was at its highest during summer. Humoral response increased after 6 h of movement restriction stress and returned to baseline levels after 12 h. Basal redox state was maintained throughout the year, with no significant changes in protein damage, and antioxidant activity was modulated mainly in relation to variation to environment cues, increasing during high temperatures and decreasing during windy nights. Antioxidant activity increased after the 6 h of stressful stimuli especially during summer and autumn, and to a lesser extent in early winter, but redox state did not vary. However, protein damage increased after 12 h of stress during summer. Prolonged stress when the bat is engaged in activities of high energy demand overcame its capacity to maintain homeostasis resulting in oxidative damage.

"The environmental drivers of species distributions and abundances are at the core of ecological research. However, the effects of these drivers on human abundance are not well-known. Here, we report how net primary productivity, biodiversity, and pathogen stress affect human population density using global ethnographic hunter-gatherer data. Our results show that productivity has significant effects on population density globally. The most important direct drivers, however, depend on environmental conditions: biodiversity influences population density exclusively in low-productivity regions, whereas pathogen stress does so in high-productivity regions. Our results also indicate that subtropical and temperate forest biomes provide the highest carrying capacity for hunter-gatherer populations. These findings document that environmental factors play a key role in shaping global population density patterns of preagricultural humans.

"Powassan virus is a neurovirulent flavivirus consisting of two lineages causing meningoencephalitis. It is the only member of the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup which is present in mainland North America. With a total number of 27 cases from 1958 to 1998 and 98 cases from 1999 to 2016, reported cases have increased by 671% over the last 18 years. Powassan infection is transmitted by different tick species in different geographical regions. Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector that transmits the virus on the East Coast of US and Ixodes cookei in the Midwest and Canada, while Hemaphysalis longicornis is the vector in Russia. Powassan has no singular pathognomonic finding and presents with a wide spectrum of symptoms including severe neurological symptoms. The clinical challenge lies within the management of the disease as there is no standard diagnostic protocol and most cases are only diagnosed after a patient goes through an extensive workup for other infectious disease. The diagnosis is established by a combination of imaging and serologic tests. In case of Powassan meningoencephalitis, computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging show vascular insults, which are also seen in cases of tick-borne encephalitis virus, another flavivirus of medical importance. Serologic tests are the gold standard for diagnosis, although testing is not widely available and only state health departments and Center for Disease Control and Prevention can perform Powassan-specific IgM antibody testing utilizing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence antibody. Powassan is also of veterinary medical importance. Wildlife animals act as a reservoir to the pathogens, hence possessing threat to humans and domestic animals. This review highlights Powassan's neurotropic presentation, epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and prevalence. Strong emphasis is placed on establishing diagnostic protocols, widespread Powassan-specific IgM testing, role of the vector in disease presentation, and necessary preventive research.

"Although reproductive strategies can be influenced by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, life history theory provides a rigorous framework for explaining variation in reproductive effort. The terminal investment hypothesis proposes that a decreased expectation of future reproduction (as might arise from a mortality threat) should precipitate increased investment in current reproduction. Terminal investment has been widely studied, and a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic cues that elicit such a response have been identified across an array of taxa. Although terminal investment is often treated as a static strategy, the level at which a cue of decreased future reproduction is sufficient to trigger increased current reproductive effort (i.e., the terminal investment threshold) may depend on context, including the internal state of the organism or its current external environment, independent of the cue that triggers a shift in reproductive investment. Here, we review empirical studies that address the terminal investment hypothesis, exploring both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that mediate its expression. Based on these studies, we propose a novel framework within which to view the strategy of terminal investment, incorporating factors that influence an individual's residual reproductive value beyond a terminal investment trigger - the dynamic terminal investment threshold.

"Most viruses in the genus Flavivirus are horizontally transmitted between hematophagous arthropods and vertebrate hosts, but some are maintained in arthropod- or vertebrate-restricted transmission cycles. Flaviviruses maintained by vertebrate-only transmission are commonly referred to as no known vector (NKV) flaviviruses. Fourteen species and two subtypes of NKV flaviviruses are recognized by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), and Tamana bat virus potentially belongs to this group. NKV flaviviruses have been isolated in nature almost exclusively from bats and rodents; exceptions are the two isolates of Dakar bat virus recovered from febrile humans and the recent isolations of Sokoluk virus from field-collected ticks, which raises questions as to whether it should remain classified as an NKV flavivirus. There is evidence to suggest that two other NKV flaviviruses, Entebbe bat virus and Yokose virus, may also infect arthropods in nature. The best characterized bat- and rodent-associated NKV flaviviruses are Rio Bravo and Modoc viruses, respectively, but both have received limited research attention compared to many of their arthropod-infecting counterparts. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of NKV flaviviruses, placing a particular emphasis on their classification, host range, geographic distribution, replication kinetics, pathogenesis, transmissibility and molecular biology.

"The present study was aimed to evaluate the factors associated with prevalence of various ectoparasites among goats during winter season in two different agro-climatic regions of India. A total of 320 goats (Uttarakhand-208; Uttar Pradesh-112) were screened and evaluated for ectoparasitism and associated factors. The occurrence of ectoparasitism in goats was studied in relation with age, sex, breed, housing, agro-climatic region and system of rearing. Prevalence of ectoparasitism among goats of lower Shivalik region (Dehradun and Tehri Garhwal districts) of Uttarakhand and Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh was 90.38 and 39.29%, respectively. The common ectoparasites observed were chewing lice (Bovicola caprae), sucking lice (Linognathus africanus), fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) and ticks (Haemaphysalis spp.). Among all the ectoparasitic infestation, pediculosis was the most common affection during the study period in both agro-climatic region; chewing lice in Uttarakhand and sucking lice in Uttar Pradesh. Agro-climatic region, breed, immune status, system of rearing and hygiene were highly affecting the prevalence and distribution of ectoparasites among goats. High prevalence of ectoparasitism in the study area warrants the need for formulating appropriate intervention strategies to improve control of ectoparasites and awareness among goat farmers.

"Vector-borne diseases represent a threat to human and wildlife populations and mathematical models provide a means to understand and control epidemics involved in complex host-vector systems. The disease model studied here is a host-vector system with a relapsing class of host individuals, used to investigate tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). Equilibrium analysis is performed for models with increasing numbers of relapses and multiple hosts and the disease reproduction number, R0, is generalized to establish relationships with parameters that would result in the elimination of the disease. We show that host relapses in a single competent host-vector system is needed to maintain an endemic state. We show that the addition of an incompetent second host with no relapses increases the number of relapses needed for maintaining the pathogen in the first competent host system. Further, coupling of the system with hosts of differing competencies will always reduce R0, making it more difficult for the system to reach an endemic state.

"In this chapter, we describe 73 zoonotic viruses that were isolated in Northern Eurasia and that belong to the different families of viruses with a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome. The family includes viruses with a segmented negative-sense ssRNA genome (families Bunyaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae) and viruses with a positive-sense ssRNA genome (families Togaviridae and Flaviviridae). Among them are viruses associated with sporadic cases or outbreaks of human disease, such as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (viruses of the genus Hantavirus), Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHFV, Nairovirus), California encephalitis (INKV, TAHV, and KHATV; Orthobunyavirus), sandfly fever (SFCV and SFNV, Phlebovirus), Tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV, Flavivirus), Omsk hemorrhagic fever (OHFV, Flavivirus), West Nile fever (WNV, Flavivirus), Sindbis fever (SINV, Alphavirus) Chikungunya fever (CHIKV, Alphavirus) and others. Other viruses described in the chapter can cause epizootics in wild or domestic animals: Geta virus (GETV, Alphavirus), Influenza A virus (Influenzavirus A), Bhanja virus (BHAV, Phlebovirus) and more. The chapter also discusses both ecological peculiarities that promote the circulation of these viruses in natural foci and factors influencing the occurrence of epidemic and epizootic outbreaks

"Many of the mechanisms underlying density-dependent regulation of populations, including contest competition and disease spread, depend on contact among neighboring animals. Understanding how variation in population density influences the frequency of contact among neighboring animals is therefore an important aspect to understanding the mechanisms underlying, and ecological consequences of, density-dependent regulation. However, contact rates are difficult to measure in the field and may be influenced by density through multiple pathways. This study explored how local density affects contact rates among Channel Island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) through two pathways: changes in home range size and changes in home range overlap. We tracked 40 radio-collared foxes at four sites on San Clemente Island, California. Fox densities at the four sites ranged from 2.8 ± 1.28 to 42.8 ± 9.43 foxes/km(2). Higher fox densities were correlated with smaller home ranges (R (2) = 0.526, F 1,38 = 42.19, P < 0.001). Thirty foxes wore collars that also contained proximity loggers, which recorded the time and duration of occasions when collared foxes were within 5 m of one another. Contact rates between neighboring fox dyads were positively correlated with home range overlap (R (2)  = 0.341, P = 0.008), but not fox density (R (2)  = 0.012, P = 0.976). Individuals at high densities had more collared neighbors with overlapping home ranges (R (2)  = 0.123, P = 0.026) but not an increase in the amount of contact between individual neighbors. This study was the first time contact rates were directly measured and compared to density and home range overlap. Results suggest that foxes exhibit a threshold in their degree of tolerance for neighbors, overlap is a reliable index of the amount of direct contact between island foxes, and disease transmission rates will likely scale with fox density.

"Extensive experimental animal studies and epidemiological observations have shown that environmental influences during early development affect the risk of later pathophysiological processes associated with chronic, especially noncommunicable, disease (NCD). This field is recognized as the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD). We discuss the extent to which DOHaD represents the result of the physiological processes of developmental plasticity, which may have potential adverse consequences in terms of NCD risk later, or whether it is the manifestation of pathophysiological processes acting in early life but only becoming apparent as disease later. We argue that the evidence suggests the former, through the operation of conditioning processes induced across the normal range of developmental environments, and we summarize current knowledge of the physiological processes involved. The adaptive pathway to later risk accords with current concepts in evolutionary developmental biology, especially those concerning parental effects. Outside the normal range, effects on development can result in nonadaptive processes, and we review their underlying mechanisms and consequences. New concepts concerning the underlying epigenetic and other mechanisms involved in both disruptive and nondisruptive pathways to disease are reviewed, including the evidence for transgenerational passage of risk from both maternal and paternal lines. These concepts have wider implications for understanding the causes and possible prevention of NCDs such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, for broader social policy and for the increasing attention paid in public health to the lifecourse approach to NCD prevention.

"Here we present, for the first time, a glossary of biometeorological terms. The glossary aims to address the need for a reliable source of biometeorological definitions, thereby facilitating communication and mutual understanding in this rapidly expanding field. A total of 171 terms are defined, with reference to 234 citations. It is anticipated that the glossary will be revisited in coming years, updating terms and adding new terms, as appropriate. The glossary is intended to provide a useful resource to the biometeorology community, and to this end, readers are encouraged to contact the lead author to suggest additional terms for inclusion in later versions of the glossary as a result of new and emerging developments in the field.

"Poxviruses as a group can infect a large number of animals. However, at the level of individual viruses, even closely related poxviruses display highly diverse host ranges and virulence. For example, variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, is human-specific and highly virulent only to humans, whereas related cowpox viruses naturally infect a broad spectrum of animals and only cause relatively mild disease in humans. The successful replication of poxviruses depends on their effective manipulation of the host antiviral responses, at the cellular-, tissue- and species-specific levels, which constitutes a molecular basis for differences in poxvirus host range and virulence. A number of poxvirus genes have been identified that possess host range function in experimental settings, and many of these host range genes target specific antiviral host pathways. Herein, we review the biology of poxviruses with a focus on host range, zoonotic infections, virulence, genomics and host range genes as well as the current knowledge about the function of poxvirus host range factors and how their interaction with the host innate immune system contributes to poxvirus host range and virulence. We further discuss the evolution of host range and virulence in poxviruses as well as host switches and potential poxvirus threats for human and animal health.

"Respiratory infections in animal species are as ubiquitous as they are in humans. Species that may be affected include mammals, birds, and reptiles. In these animal species some viruses primarily infect the respiratory tract, while other viruses infect non-respiratory organs. Viruses are generally classified according to the type of their nucleic acid, their protein structure, and whether or not they have a lipid-containing envelope surrounding the viral particle. In general, most viruses gain entry into the lungs via the conducting airways. In nonprimate mammalians these infections are most prominent in the cranioventral lung lobes because of their horizontal position. Table 24.1 lists some of the major viruses that cause pneumonia and other lung diseases in animals.

"Parasites appropriate host resources to feed and/or to reproduce, and lower host fitness to varying degrees. As a consequence, they can negatively impact human and animal health, food production, economic trade, and biodiversity conservation. They can also be difficult to study and have historically been regarded as having little influence on ecosystem organization and function. Not surprisingly, parasitic biodiversity has to date not been the focus of much positive attention from the conservation community. However, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that parasites are extremely diverse, have key roles in ecological and evolutionary processes, and that infection may paradoxically result in ecosystem services of direct human relevance. Here we argue that wildlife parasites should be considered meaningful conservation targets no less relevant than their hosts. We discuss their numerical and functional importance, current conservation status, and outline a series of non-trivial challenges to consider before incorporating parasite biodiversity in conservation strategies. We also suggest that addressing the key knowledge gaps and communication deficiencies that currently impede broad discussions about parasite conservation requires input from wildlife parasitologists.

"Gene transfer agents (GTAs) randomly transfer short fragments of a bacterial genome. A novel putative GTA was recently discovered in the mouse-infecting bacterium Bartonella grahamii. Although GTAs are widespread in phylogenetically diverse bacteria, their role in evolution is largely unknown. Here, we present a comparative analysis of 16 Bartonella genomes ranging from 1.4 to 2.6 Mb in size, including six novel genomes from Bartonella isolated from a cow, two moose, two dogs, and a kangaroo. A phylogenetic tree inferred from 428 orthologous core genes indicates that the deadly human pathogen B. bacilliformis is related to the ruminant-adapted clade, rather than being the earliest diverging species in the genus as previously thought. A gene flux analysis identified 12 genes for a GTA and a phage-derived origin of replication as the most conserved innovations. These are located in a region of a few hundred kb that also contains 8 insertions of gene clusters for type III, IV, and V secretion systems, and genes for putatively secreted molecules such as cholera-like toxins. The phylogenies indicate a recent transfer of seven genes in the virB gene cluster for a type IV secretion system from a cat-adapted B. henselae to a dog-adapted B. vinsonii strain. We show that the B. henselae GTA is functional and can transfer genes in vitro. We suggest that the maintenance of the GTA is driven by selection to increase the likelihood of horizontal gene transfer and argue that this process is beneficial at the population level, by facilitating adaptive evolution of the host-adaptation systems and thereby expansion of the host range size. The process counters gene loss and forces all cells to contribute to the production of the GTA and the secreted molecules. The results advance our understanding of the role that GTAs play for the evolution of bacterial genomes.

"The extent to which fluctuating selection can maintain evolutionary stasis in most populations remains an unresolved question in evolutionary biology. Climate has been hypothesized to drive reversals in the direction of selection among different time periods and may also be responsible for intense episodic selection caused by rare weather events. We measured viability selection associated with morphological traits in cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) in western Nebraska, USA, over a 14-year period following a rare climatic event. We used mark-recapture to estimate the annual apparent survival of over 26 000 individuals whose wing, tail, tarsus and bill had been measured. The fitness functions associated with tarsus length and bill dimensions fluctuated depending on annual climate conditions on the birds' breeding grounds. The oscillating yearly patterns may have slowed and occasionally reversed directional change in trait trajectories, although there was a trend over time for all traits except tarsus to increase in size. The net positive directional selection on some traits, despite periodic climate-associated fluctuations, suggests that cliff swallow morphology in the population is likely to keep changing and supports recent work contending that selection in general does not fluctuate enough to be an effective driver of stasis.

"It is now generally acknowledged that climate change has wide-ranging biological consequences, potentially leading to impacts on biodiversity. Environmental factors can have diverse and often strong effects on reproduction, with obvious ramifications for population fitness. Nevertheless, reproductive traits are often neglected in conservation considerations. Focusing on animals, recent progress in sexual selection and sexual conflict research suggests that reproductive costs may pose an underestimated hurdle during rapid climate change, potentially lowering adaptive potential and increasing extinction risk of certain populations. Nevertheless, regime shifts may have both negative and positive effects on reproduction, so it is important to acquire detailed experimental data. We hence present an overview of the literature reporting short-term reproductive consequences of exposure to different environmental factors. From the enormous diversity of findings, we conclude that climate change research could benefit greatly from more coordinated efforts incorporating evolutionary approaches in order to obtain cross-comparable data on how individual and population reproductive fitness respond in the long term. Therefore, we propose ideas and methods concerning future efforts dealing with reproductive consequences of climate change, in particular by highlighting the advantages of multi-generational experimental evolution experiments.

"The major focus of this chapter is the naturally occurring viral diseases of rabbits and hares. The viral diseases of rabbits are discussed in an order based on the taxonomic groups to which the viruses belong and are independent of the order of importance of the various diseases. The material is presented under uniform subject headings, including history, etiology, epidemiology, clinical signs, pathology, diagnosis, and control. Control is interpreted broadly and includes both prevention and eradication. Some viral infections of rabbits have provided fundamental information on basic mechanisms of agent–host interrelationships, e.g., Myxoma virus, and others have been useful as models for human diseases, e.g., Rotavirus. The principal emphasis is on virus infections of domestic rabbits of the genus Oryctolagus. Naturally occurring and experimental infections of other rabbits and hares are also discussed in this chapter. Incoming rabbits are obtained from sources free of infections but appropriate quarantine and screening measures are standard operating procedures. None of the viral infections of rabbits is known to be of public health importance as there are no reports of the definitive spread of viruses from rabbits to humans.

"Infectious diseases are increasingly recognised to be a major threat to biodiversity. Disease management tools such as control of animal movements and vaccination can be used to mitigate the impact and spread of diseases in targeted species. They can reduce the risk of epidemics and in turn the risks of population decline and extinction. However, all species are embedded in communities and interactions between species can be complex, hence increasing the chance of survival of one species can have repercussions on the whole community structure. In this study, we use an example from the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania to explore how a vaccination campaign against Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) targeted at conserving the African lion (Panthera leo), could affect the viability of a coexisting threatened species, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). Assuming that CDV plays a role in lion regulation, our results suggest that a vaccination programme, if successful, risks destabilising the simple two-species system considered, as simulations show that vaccination interventions could almost double the probability of extinction of an isolated cheetah population over the next 60 years. This work uses a simple example to illustrate how predictive modelling can be a useful tool in examining the consequence of vaccination interventions on non-target species. It also highlights the importance of carefully considering linkages between human-intervention, species viability and community structure when planning species-based conservation actions.

"Poxviruses are highly successful pathogens, known to infect a variety of hosts. The family Poxviridae includes Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, which has been eradicated as a public health threat but could potentially reemerge as a bioterrorist threat. The risk scenario includes other animal poxviruses and genetically engineered manipulations of poxviruses. Studies of orthologous gene sets have established the evolutionary relationships of members within the Poxviridae family. It is not clear, however, how variations between family members arose in the past, an important issue in understanding how these viruses may vary and possibly produce future threats. Using a newly developed poxvirus-specific tool, we predicted accurate gene sets for viruses with completely sequenced genomes in the genus Orthopoxvirus. Employing sensitive sequence comparison techniques together with comparison of syntenic gene maps, we established the relationships between all viral gene sets. These techniques allowed us to unambiguously identify the gene loss/gain events that have occurred over the course of orthopoxvirus evolution. It is clear that for all existing Orthopoxvirus species, no individual species has acquired protein-coding genes unique to that species. All existing species contain genes that are all present in members of the species Cowpox virus and that cowpox virus strains contain every gene present in any other orthopoxvirus strain. These results support a theory of reductive evolution in which the reduction in size of the core gene set of a putative ancestral virus played a critical role in speciation and confining any newly emerging virus species to a particular environmental (host or tissue) niche.

"BACKGROUND: Massively parallel sequencing of cDNA is now an efficient route for generating enormous sequence collections that represent expressed genes. This approach provides a valuable starting point for characterizing functional genetic variation in non-model organisms, especially where whole genome sequencing efforts are currently cost and time prohibitive. The large and complex genomes of pines (Pinus spp.) have hindered the development of genomic resources, despite the ecological and economical importance of the group. While most genomic studies have focused on a single species (P. taeda), genomic level resources for other pines are insufficiently developed to facilitate ecological genomic research. Lodgepole pine (P. contorta) is an ecologically important foundation species of montane forest ecosystems and exhibits substantial adaptive variation across its range in western North America. Here we describe a sequencing study of expressed genes from P. contorta, including their assembly and annotation, and their potential for molecular marker development to support population and association genetic studies. RESULTS: We obtained 586,732 sequencing reads from a 454 GS XLR70 Titanium pyrosequencer (mean length: 306 base pairs). A combination of reference-based and de novo assemblies yielded 63,657 contigs, with 239,793 reads remaining as singletons. Based on sequence similarity with known proteins, these sequences represent approximately 17,000 unique genes, many of which are well covered by contig sequences. This sequence collection also included a surprisingly large number of retrotransposon sequences, suggesting that they are highly transcriptionally active in the tissues we sampled. We located and characterized thousands of simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms as potential molecular markers in our assembled and annotated sequences. High quality PCR primers were designed for a substantial number of the SSR loci, and a large number of these were amplified successfully in initial screening. CONCLUSIONS: This sequence collection represents a major genomic resource for P. contorta, and the large number of genetic markers characterized should contribute to future research in this and other pines. Our results illustrate the utility of next generation sequencing as a basis for marker development and population genomics in non-model species.

"BACKGROUND: In studies where microsatellite markers are employed, it is essential that the primers designed will reliably and consistently amplify target loci. In populations conforming to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), screening for unreliable markers often relies on the identification of heterozygote deficiencies and subsequent departures from HWE. However, since many populations naturally deviate from HWE, such as many marine invertebrates, it can be difficult to distinguish heterozygote deficiencies resulting from unreliable markers from natural processes. Thus, studies of populations that are suspected to deviate from HWE naturally would benefit from a method to validate genotype data-sets and test the reliability of the designed primers. Levels of heterozygosity are reported for the prosobranch mollusc Hydrobia ulvae (Pennant) together with a method of genotype validation and primer assessment that utilises two primer sets for each locus. Microsatellite loci presented are the first described for the species Hydrobia ulvae; the five loci presented will be of value in further study of populations of H. ulvae. RESULTS: We have developed a novel method of testing primer reliability in naturally heterozygote deficient populations. After the design of an initial primer set, genotyping in 48 Hydrobia ulvae specimens using a single primer set (Primer set_A) revealed heterozygote deficiency in six of the seven loci examined. Redesign of six of the primer pairs (Primer set_B), re-genotyping of the successful individuals from Primer set_A using Primer set_B, and comparison of genotypes between the two primer sets, enabled the identification of two loci (Hulv-06 & Hulv-07) that showed a high degree of discrepancy between primer sets A and B (0% & only 25% alleles matching, respectively), suggesting unreliability in these primers. The discrepancies included changes from heterozygotes to homozygotes or vice versa, and some individuals who also displayed new alleles of unexpected sizes. Of the other four loci examined (Hulv-01, Hulv-03, Hulv-04, & Hulv-05), all showed more than 95% agreement between primer sets. Hulv-01, Hulv-03, & Hulv-05 displayed similar levels of heterozygosity with both primer sets suggesting that these loci are indeed heterozygote deficient, while Hulv-08 showed no deficiency in either primer set. CONCLUSION: The simple method described to identify unreliable markers will prove a useful technique for many population studies, and also emphasises the dangers in using a single primer set and assuming marker reliability in populations shown to naturally deviate from HWE.

"Powassan virus was isolated from seven pools of Ixodes cookei ticks removed from groundhogs (Marmota monax) collected near North Bay, Ontario, between May and August 1965, including five pools obtained during spring. Tick pools, each comprising one to nine ticks, contained 2.0 to 5.5 log(10) TCD(50) of virus upon titration in monolayer cultures of primary swine kidney cells. Powassan virus neutralizing antibody prevalence in sera of the current season's groundhogs increased steadily from zero during May to 25% during August but remained relatively unchanged (42% to 58%) in the previous season's groundhogs, thereby confirming that active infection had occurred particularly amongst juvenile groundhogs mainly during spring 1965. Isolation of one strain of Silverwater virus from Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris ticks and detection of neutralizing antibody in three of nine snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) confirmed the active spread of this agent during 1965.

"Powassan virus was isolated from a pool of Ixodes marxi ticks collected during late August 1962, from a red squirrel, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, and from blood obtained from a red squirrel during early October 1962 near Powassan, Ontario, where a child contracted fatal encephalitis due to this virus in September 1958. The frequent detection of Powassan virus neutralizing antibody in sera of squirrels captured during autumn, but rarely at other seasons, and the frequent I. marxi infestation of squirrels, some of which contain antibody, but the lack of occurrence of I. marxi on other forest rodents, suggest that I. marxi ticks are vectors and squirrels are reservoirs of Powassan virus infection. Isolation of Silverwater virus from Haemaphysalis leporis-palustris ticks which infested a snowshoe hare Lepus americanus near Powassan demonstrates the presence of this agent in the Powassan area also.

"From apparently normal voles captured on Grosse Isle, Province of Quebec, Canada, an infective agent has been grown in embryonated eggs, and by inoculation an inapparent infection was established in voles, mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rats. No growth of the agent was obtained in the absence of living cells, and the manner of its development in the yolk sac of embryonated eggs, as well as morphological, epidemiological, and pathogenic features, indicates a rickettsial nature. The inability to transmit infection by either cage or intrauterine contact points to a vector, and mites are shown to have a probable part in the epidemiology. Mice infected with the vole agent resist lethal doses of the Karp strain of scrub typhus, and certain epidemiological, morphological, and immunological features support the relationship indicated by the mouse tests. It is therefore concluded that voles on this island have an inapparent infection due to a rickettsia that may be related to the rickettsia of scrub typhus.

"Muscle atrophy is a side effect of several terrestrial diseases which also affects astronauts severely in space missions due to the reduced gravity in spaceflight. An integrative graph-theoretic network-based drug repurposing methodology quantifying the interplay of key gene regulations and protein-protein interactions in muscle atrophy conditions is presented. Transcriptomic datasets from mice in spaceflight from GeneLab have been extensively mined to extract the key genes that cause muscle atrophy in organ muscle tissues such as the thymus, liver, and spleen. Top muscle atrophy gene regulators are selected by Bayesian Markov blanket method and gene-disease knowledge graph is constructed using the scalable precision medicine knowledge engine. A deep graph neural network is trained for predicting links in the network. The top ranked diseases are identified and drugs are selected for repurposing using drug bank resource. A disease drug knowledge graph is constructed and the graph neural network is trained for predicting new drugs. The results are compared with machine learning methods such as random forest, and gradient boosting classifiers. Network measure based methods shows that preferential attachment has good performance for link prediction in both the gene-disease and disease-drug graphs. The receiver operating characteristic curves, and prediction accuracies for each method show that the random walk similarity measure and deep graph neural network outperforms the other methods. Several key target genes identified by the graph neural network are associated with diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neural disorders. The novel link prediction approach applied to the disease drug knowledge graph identifies the Monoclonal Antibodies drug therapy as suitable candidate for drug repurposing for spaceflight induced microgravity. There are a total of 21 drugs identified as possible candidates for treating muscle atrophy. Graph neural network is a promising deep learning architecture for link prediction from gene-disease, and disease-drug networks.

"Ischemic and traumatic injuries to CNS remain leading causes of death and disability worldwide, despite decades of research into risk factors, therapies, and preventative measures. Recent studies showed that CNS injuries significantly alter the cerebral microRNAome that impact the secondary brain damage as well as plasticity and recovery. Many microRNA based therapies are currently in various clinical trials for different pathologic conditions indicating their therapeutic potential. In the present review, we discuss the role of miR-21 in acute CNS injuries which is currently thought to be a potent neuroprotective microRNA. We emphasize on the potential of miR-21 in promoting cell and tissue survival and preventing inflammation and apoptosis. We also discussed the role of miR-21 in conditioning the brain to promote ischemic tolerance. Finally, we discussed some of the challenges and difficulties to develop miR-21 as a neuroprotective therapy in humans.

"Glycolysis is a well-known process by which metabolically active cells, such as tumor or immune cells meet their high metabolic demands. Previously, our laboratory has demonstrated that in airway epithelial cells, the pleiotropic cytokine, interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) induces glycolysis and that this contributes to allergic airway inflammation and remodeling. Activation of glycolysis is known to increase NADPH reducing equivalents generated from the pentose phosphate pathway, linking metabolic reprogramming with redox homeostasis. In addition, numerous glycolytic enzymes are known to be redox regulated. However, whether and how redox chemistry regulates metabolic reprogramming more generally remains unclear. In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach in primary mouse airway basal cells to evaluate the role of protein redox biochemistry, specifically protein glutathionylation, in mediating metabolic reprogramming. Our findings demonstrate that IL1B induces glutathionylation of multiple proteins involved in metabolic regulation, notably in the glycolysis pathway. Cells lacking Glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx), the enzyme responsible for reversing glutathionylation, show modulation of multiple metabolic pathways including an enhanced IL1B-induced glycolytic response. This was accompanied by increased secretion of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine important in asthma pathogenesis. Targeted inhibition of glycolysis prevented TSLP release, confirming the functional relevance of enhanced glycolysis in cells stimulated with IL1B. Collectively, data herein point to an intriguing link between glutathionylation chemistry and glycolytic reprogramming in epithelial cells and suggest that glutathionylation chemistry may represent a therapeutic target in pulmonary pathologies with perturbations in the glycolysis pathway.

"Melanophryniscus admirabilis (admirable red-belly toad) is a microendemic and critically endangered species found exclusively along 700 m of the Forqueta River, in a fragment of the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil. One of the greatest concerns regarding the conservation of this species is the extensive use of pesticides in areas surrounding their natural habitat. In recent years, the adaptation and persistence of animal species in human-impacted environments have been associated with microbiota. Therefore, the present study aimed to characterize the oral bacterial community of wild M. admirabilis and to address the question of how this community might contribute to this toad's adaptation in the anthropogenic environment as well as its general metabolic capabilities. A total of 11 oral samples collected from wild M. admirabilis were characterized and analyzed via high-throughput sequencing. Fragments of the 16S rRNA variable region 4 (V4) were amplified, and sequencing was conducted using an Ion Personal Genome Machine (PGM) System with 316 chips. A total of 181,350 sequences were obtained, resulting in 16 phyla, 34 classes, 39 orders, and 77 families. Proteobacteria dominated (53%) the oral microbiota of toads, followed by Firmicutes (18%), Bacteroidetes (17%), and Actinobacteria (5%). No significant differences in microbial community profile from among the samples were reported, which suggests that the low dietary diversity observed in this population may directly influence the bacterial composition. Inferences of microbiome function were performed using PICRUSt2 software. Important pathways (e.g., xenobiotic degradation pathways for pesticides and aromatic phenolic compounds) were detected, which suggests that the bacterial communities may serve important roles in M. admirabilis health and survival in the anthropogenic environment. Overall, our results have important implications for the conservation and management of this microendemic and critically endangered species.

"Extracellular adenosine, a danger signal, can cause hypothermia. We generated mice lacking neuronal adenosine A1 receptors (A1AR, encoded by the Adora1 gene) to examine the contribution of these receptors to hypothermia. Intracerebroventricular injection of the selective A1AR agonist (Cl-ENBA, 5'-chloro-5'-deoxy-N6-endo-norbornyladenosine) produced hypothermia, which was reduced in mice with deletion of A1AR in neurons. A non-brain penetrant A1AR agonist [SPA, N6-(p-sulfophenyl) adenosine] also caused hypothermia, in wild type but not mice lacking neuronal A1AR, suggesting that peripheral neuronal A1AR can also cause hypothermia. Mice expressing Cre recombinase from the Adora1 locus were generated to investigate the role of specific cell populations in body temperature regulation. Chemogenetic activation of Adora1-Cre-expressing cells in the preoptic area did not change body temperature. In contrast, activation of Adora1-Cre-expressing dorsomedial hypothalamus cells increased core body temperature, concordant with agonism at the endogenous inhibitory A1AR causing hypothermia. These results suggest that A1AR agonism causes hypothermia via two distinct mechanisms: brain neuronal A1AR and A1AR on neurons outside the blood-brain barrier. The variety of mechanisms that adenosine can use to induce hypothermia underscores the importance of hypothermia in the mouse response to major metabolic stress or injury.

"TLRs (Toll-like receptors) are essential in host defense against pathogens. There are two types of TLR5, namely, membrane form of TLR5 (TLR5M) and soluble form of TLR5 (TLR5S), both of which perform a crucial role in flagellin response. TLR13 is a TLR that localizes to endosomes and recognizes nucleic acids released by internal microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Here, the full-length coding sequence (CDS), protein structure, and immune response and subcellular localization of TLR5 (TLR5S) and TLR13 were characterized in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea). These TLRs share high sequence homology with other ichthyic TLRs, while also having their own characters; qtPCR was determined and the results found that the three genes were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues: TLR5M was highly expressed in the spleen and liver; TLR13 expression was high in the kidney, liver, and spleen. And TLRs were upregulated following stimulation with Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the liver, spleen, and kidney. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that TLR5M were localized in the cytoplasm, while TLR5S and TLR13 were in the endosome. The evolutionary analysis has shown that TLR13 was clustered with TLR11, 19, 20, 21, and 22, while TLR5 and TLR3 were classified into a group; these results suggest that TLRs are vital in the defense of L. crocea against bacterial infection and further increase our understanding of TLR function in innate immunity in teleosts.

"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. The etiology of MS is multifactorial, with disease risk determined by genetics and environmental factors. An emerging risk factor for immune-mediated diseases is an imbalance in the gut microbiome. However, the identity of gut microbes associated with disease risk, their mechanisms of action, and the interactions with host genetics remain obscure. To address these questions, we utilized the principal autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), together with a genetically diverse mouse model representing 29 unique host genotypes, interrogated by microbiome sequencing and targeted microbiome manipulation. We identified specific gut bacteria and their metabolic functions associated with EAE susceptibility, implicating short-chain fatty acid metabolism as a key element conserved across multiple host genotypes. In parallel, we used a reductionist approach focused on two of the most disparate phenotypes identified in our screen. Manipulation of the gut microbiome by transplantation and cohousing demonstrated that transfer of these microbiomes into genetically identical hosts was sufficient to modulate EAE susceptibility and systemic metabolite profiles. Parallel bioinformatic approaches identified Lactobacillus reuteri as a commensal species unexpectedly associated with exacerbation of EAE in a genetically susceptible host, which was functionally confirmed by bacterial isolation and commensal colonization studies. These results reveal complex interactions between host genetics and gut microbiota modulating susceptibility to CNS autoimmunity, providing insights into microbiome-directed strategies aimed at lowering the risk for autoimmune disease and underscoring the need to consider host genetics and baseline gut microbiome composition.

"Control of temperature variation is of primordial importance in particular areas of biomedicine. In this context, medical treatments such as hyperthermia and cryotherapy, and also the development and use of hydrogel-based biomaterials, are of particular concern. To enable accurate temperature measurement without perturbing or even destroying the biological tissue or material to be monitored, contactless thermometry methods are preferred. Among these, the most suitable are based on magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI, MRS). Here, we address the latest developments in this field as well as their current and anticipated practical applications. We highlight recent progress aimed at rendering MR thermometry faster and more reproducible, versatile, and sophisticated and provide our perspective on how these new techniques broaden the range of applications in medical treatments and biomaterial development by enabling insight into finer details of thermal behavior. Thus, these methods facilitate optimization of clinical and industrial heating and cooling protocols.

"Animal gut microbiomes can be clustered into ""enterotypes"" characterized by an abundance of signature genera. The characteristic determinants, stability, and resilience of these community clusters remain poorly understood. We used plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) as a model and identified three enterotypes by 16S rDNA sequencing. Among the top 15 genera, 13 showed significantly different levels of abundance between the enterotypes combined with different microbial functions and distinct fecal short-chain fatty acids. We monitored changes in the microbial community associated with the transfer of plateau pikas from field to laboratory and observed that feeding them a single diet reduced microbial diversity, resulting in a single enterotype with an altered composition of the dominant bacteria. However, microbial diversity, an abundance of some changed dominant genera, and enterotypes were partially restored after adding swainsonine (a plant secondary compound found in the natural diet of plateau pikas) to the feed. These results provide strong evidence that gut microbial diversity and enterotypes are directly related to specific diet, thereby indicating that the formation of different enterotypes can help animals adapt to complex food conditions. Additionally, natural plant secondary compounds can maintain dominant bacteria and inter-individual differences of gut microbiota and promote the resilience of enterotypes in small herbivorous mammals.

"Injectable anesthesia protocols for five-striped palm squirrels (Funambulus pennantii) are poorly described in the literature.In this study, male intact squirrels received intramuscular injections of either alfaxalone (6 mg/kg) and ketamine (40 mg/kg; AK group, n = 8); alfaxalone (6 mg/kg), ketamine (20 mg/kg), and dexmedetomidine (0.1 mg/kg; AKD group, n = 8); or alfaxalone (8 mg/kg), butorphanol (1 mg/kg), and midazolam (1 mg/kg; ABM group, n = 8). Atipamezole (0.15 mg/kg IM) and flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg IM) were administered 40 min after anesthesia induction (defined as loss of the righting reflex) with AKD and ABM, respectively. Heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature, and reflexes were recorded every 5 min during anesthesia. Anesthetic induction was rapid in all groups (AK: median, 49 s; range, 33 to 60 s; AKD, 60 s; 54 to 70 s; and ABM, 15 s; 5 to 58 s). The anesthetic duration (from induction to full recovery) for the AK group was 62 ± 3 min (mean ± 1 SD). Therewas no statistically significant difference between the ABM and AKD groups regarding recovery time after partial antagonist administration and was 51 ± 5 and 48 ± 5 min, respectively. All AK animals showed twitching and abnormal vocalization during recovery. The righting reflex was absent in all squirrels for 20 min in the AK treatment group and throughout the 40-min anesthetic period in the AKD and ABM groups. The frontlimb withdrawal response was absent in all squirrels for the 40-min anesthetic period in the AKD and ABM groups, with variable responses for the AK treatment. All tested protocols in this study provided safe and effective immobilization in five-striped palm squirrels, but oxygen and thermal support wereindicated. Anesthetic depth must be determined before surgical procedures are performed in palm squirrels anesthetized by using these regimens.

"Sex-biassed and age-biassed parasite infections are common in nature, including ectoparasites-vertebrate host systems. We investigated the effect of Amur Falcons' sex, age and body size on the abundance of their lice at a migratory stopover site, where the falcons' habitat use and behaviour are more homogeneous across sex and age categories than during the breeding season. We sampled Amur Falcons in Nagaland, India at major roosting sites in 2016. We applied generalized linear models (with negative binomial distribution and log-link) to model the abundance of their two most numerous lice (Colpocephalum subzerafae and Degeeriella rufa) using the host age category (juvenile or adult) and wing length, both in interaction with sex, as explanatory variables. The abundance of C. subzerafae was only affected by host age, being nearly four times higher on juveniles than on adults. Juveniles were also more infested with D. rufa than the adults. Additionally, the abundance of the latter species was lower on adult male Falcons as compared to adult females. A juvenile bias in ectoparasite infestations is common in nature, probably due to juveniles being immunologically naïve, more resource-limited and may be inexperienced in body maintenance behaviours like preening and grooming. On the other hand, female-biassed infestations are much rarer than male-biassed infestations. We briefly discuss the possible causes of female-biassed infestations on Amur Falcons reported here, and in the closely related Red-footed Falcon and Lesser Kestrel as reported in the literature.

"Neoplasia is a multilevel condition caused by irregularities over the genome, which can lead to a fatal result. To fully understand this phenomenon, an evolutionary challenge has risen during the last decades, away from human limits, driving the scientific quest into the wild life. The study of wild vertebrate populations in their natural habitats has shown that cancer is rather prominent. Thus, the diversity of vertebrates reported with some form of neoplasia is quite scattered through a variety of habitats. However, some species constitute exceptions by exhibiting cancer-protective features, driven by certain loci in their DNA. It is obvious that from an evolutionary standpoint, the incidence of cancer in different taxa is nowadays studied by seeking for patterns and their roots. The main purpose of the evolutionary approach is no other than to answer a fundamental question: Could cancer be ultimately regarded as another evolutionary force conducive to the formation or shaping-up of species?

"In this study, we analyze the role of different structural variants of proteins in the speciation processes. We separate human and mouse proteomes (taken as a reference) into three previously defined variants of disorder: ordered proteins (ORDPs), structured proteins with intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs), and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Then, using the representation we call here Forsdyke plot, we study the correlation of DNA divergence with the corresponding protein (phenotypic) divergence in the three variants, comparing human and mouse coding sequences with their homologs from 26 eukaryotes. The parameters of the correlation are related to the speciation process. We find that the three variants of disordered proteins are differently related to the speciation process. Specifically, IDPs phenotypically diverge earlier than ORDPs and IDPRs. ORDPs diverge later but are phenotypically more reactive to nucleotide mutations than IDPRs and IDPs. Finally, IDPRs appear to diverge phenotypically later than IDPs, like ORDPs, but they are prone to accept mutations with rates that are similar to those of IDPs. We conclude that IDPs are involved in the early stages of the speciation process, whereas mutations in ORDPs, once speciation is initiated, accelerate phenotypic divergence.

"Fasting is increasingly popular to manage metabolic and inflammatory diseases. Despite the role that the human gut microbiota plays in health and diseases, little is known about its composition and functional capacity during prolonged fasting when the external nutrient supply is reduced or suppressed. We analysed the effects of a 10-d periodic fasting on the faecal microbiota of fifteen healthy men. Participants fasted according to the peer-reviewed Buchinger fasting guidelines, which involve a daily energy intake of about 1046 kJ (250 kcal) and an enema every 2 d. Serum biochemistry confirmed the metabolic switch from carbohydrates to fatty acids and ketones. Emotional and physical well-being were enhanced. Faecal 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that fasting caused a decrease in the abundance of bacteria known to degrade dietary polysaccharides such as Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. There was a concomitant increase in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria (Escherichia coli and Bilophila wadsworthia), known to use host-derived energy substrates. Changes in taxa abundance were associated with serum glucose and faecal branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), suggesting that fasting-induced changes in the gut microbiota are associated with host energy metabolism. These effects were reversed after 3 months. SCFA levels were unchanged at the end of the fasting. We also monitored intestinal permeability and inflammatory status. IL-6, IL-10, interferon γ and TNFα levels increased when food was reintroduced, suggesting a reactivation of the postprandial immune response. We suggest that changes in the gut microbiota are part of the physiological adaptations to a 10-d periodic fasting, potentially influencing its beneficial health effects.

"Mast cell neoplasia clinical presentation and biological behaviour vary considerably across mammalian species, ranging from a solitary benign mass to an aggressive systemic malignancy. Mutations in the KIT Proto-Oncogene Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (KIT) gene are common molecular abnormalities involved in mast cell tumorigenesis. KIT mutations often occur in dog, cat and human neoplastic mast cells and result in altered Kit protein structure and function. In dogs, certain KIT mutations are associated with more malignant and lethal disease. In contrast, KIT mutations in feline and human mast cell neoplasms are not correlated with prognosis, but are of value in diagnosis and treatment planning in humans. KIT genetic abnormalities have not been well investigated in other species, although aberrant cytoplasmic Kit protein staining detected in neoplasms of the ferret, horse and cow resembles aberrant Kit staining patterns detected in neoplastic mast cells of dogs, cats and humans. Mutations within KIT are classified as either regulatory-type or enzymatic pocket-type mutations according to their location within the KIT Proto-Oncogene. Mutations within the enzymatic pocket domain confer tumour resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, knowledge of tumour KIT mutation status adds valuable information for optimizing patient treatment strategies. The use of TKIs in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics has opened a new treatment avenue for patients unresponsive to existing drugs. This review highlights the similarities and differences of mast cell neoplasia in mammals with a special focus on the involvement of KIT in the canine and feline forms in comparison to human mast cell neoplasia.

"Sequencing-based analyses of microbiomes have traditionally focused on addressing the question of community membership and profiling taxonomic abundance through amplicon sequencing of 16 rRNA genes. More recently, shotgun metagenomics, which involves the random sequencing of all genomic content of a microbiome, has dominated this arena due to advancements in sequencing technology throughput and capability to profile genes as well as microbiome membership. While these methods have revealed a great number of insights into a wide variety of microbiomes, both of these approaches only describe the presence of organisms or genes, and not whether they are active members of the microbiome. To obtain deeper insights into how a microbial community responds over time to their changing environmental conditions, microbiome scientists are beginning to employ large-scale metatranscriptomics approaches. Here, we present a comprehensive review on computational metatranscriptomics approaches to study microbial community transcriptomes. We review the major advancements in this burgeoning field, compare strengths and weaknesses to other microbiome analysis methods, list available tools and workflows, and describe use cases and limitations of this method. We envision that this field will continue to grow exponentially, as will the scope of projects (e.g. longitudinal studies of community transcriptional responses to perturbations over time) and the resulting data. This review will provide a list of options for computational analysis of these data and will highlight areas in need of development.

"In this concept article, we outline a variety of new approaches that have been conceived to address some of the remaining challenges for developing improved methods of biopreservation. This recognizes a true renaissance and variety of complimentary, high-potential approaches leveraging inspiration by nature, nanotechnology, the thermodynamics of pressure, and several other key fields. Development of an organ and tissue supply chain that can meet the healthcare demands of the 21st century means overcoming twin challenges of (1) having enough of these lifesaving resources and (2) having the means to store and transport them for a variety of applications. Each has distinct but overlapping logistical limitations affecting transplantation, regenerative medicine, and drug discovery, with challenges shared among major areas of biomedicine including tissue engineering, trauma care, transfusion medicine, and biomedical research. There are several approaches to biopreservation, the optimum choice of which is dictated by the nature and complexity of the tissue and the required length of storage. Short-term hypothermic storage at temperatures a few degrees above the freezing point has provided the basis for nearly all methods of preserving tissues and solid organs that, to date, have proved refractory to cryopreservation techniques successfully developed for single-cell systems. In essence, these short-term techniques have been based on designing solutions for cellular protection against the effects of warm and cold ischemia and basically rely upon the protective effects of reduced temperatures brought about by Arrhenius kinetics of chemical reactions. However, further optimization of such preservation strategies is now seen to be restricted. Long-term preservation calls for much lower temperatures and requires the tissue to withstand the rigors of heat and mass transfer during protocols designed to optimize cooling and warming in the presence of cryoprotective agents. It is now accepted that with current methods of cryopreservation, uncontrolled ice formation in structured tissues and organs at subzero temperatures is the single most critical factor that severely restricts the extent to which tissues can survive procedures involving freezing and thawing. In recent years, this major problem has been effectively circumvented in some tissues by using ice-free cryopreservation techniques based upon vitrification. Nevertheless, despite these promising advances there remain several recognized hurdles to be overcome before deep-subzero cryopreservation, either by classic freezing and thawing or by vitrification, can provide the much-needed means for biobanking complex tissues and organs for extended periods of weeks, months, or even years. In many cases, the approaches outlined here, including new underexplored paradigms of high-subzero preservation, are novel and inspired by mechanisms of freeze tolerance, or freeze avoidance, in nature. Others apply new bioengineering techniques such as nanotechnology, isochoric pressure preservation, and non-Newtonian fluids to circumvent currently intractable problems in cryopreservation.

"BACKGROUND: One of the main challenges when analyzing complex metagenomics data is the fact that large amounts of information need to be presented in a comprehensive and easy-to-navigate way. In the process of analyzing FASTQ sequencing data, visualizing which organisms are present in the data can be useful, especially with metagenomics data or data suspected to be contaminated. Here, we describe the development and application of a command-line tool, Keanu, for visualizing and exploring sample content in metagenomics data. We developed Keanu as an interactive tool to make viewing complex data easier. RESULTS: Keanu, a tool for exploring sequence content, helps a user to understand the presence and abundance of organisms in a sample by analyzing alignments against a database that contains taxonomy data and displaying them in an interactive web page. The content of a sample can be presented either as a collapsible tree, with node size indicating abundance, or as a bilevel partition graph, with arc size indicating abundance. Here, we illustrate how Keanu works by exploring shotgun metagenomics data from a sample collected from a bluff that contained paleosols and a krotovina in an alpine site in Ft. Greely, Alaska. CONCLUSIONS: Keanu provides a simple means by which researchers can explore and visualize species present in sequence data generated from complex communities and environments. Keanu is written in Python and is freely available at https://github.com/IGBB/keanu .

"Phosphorous-containing molecules are essential constituents of all living cells. While the phosphate functional group is very common in small molecule natural products, nucleic acids, and as chemical modification in protein and peptides, phosphorous can form P⁻N (phosphoramidate), P⁻S (phosphorothioate), and P⁻C (e.g., phosphonate and phosphinate) linkages. While rare, these moieties play critical roles in many processes and in all forms of life. In this review we thoroughly categorize P⁻N, P⁻S, and P⁻C natural organophosphorus compounds. Information on biological source, biological activity, and biosynthesis is included, if known. This review also summarizes the role of phosphorylation on unusual amino acids in proteins (N- and S-phosphorylation) and reviews the natural phosphorothioate (P⁻S) and phosphoramidate (P⁻N) modifications of DNA and nucleotides with an emphasis on their role in the metabolism of the cell. We challenge the commonly held notion that nonphosphate organophosphorus functional groups are an oddity of biochemistry, with no central role in the metabolism of the cell. We postulate that the extent of utilization of some phosphorus groups by life, especially those containing P⁻N bonds, is likely severely underestimated and has been largely overlooked, mainly due to the technological limitations in their detection and analysis.

"The neuropeptide arginine vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address whether the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre-positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking (UM) in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.

"All mammals begin life in social groups, but for some species, social relationships persist and develop throughout the course of an individual's life. Research in multiple rodent species provides evidence of relatively conserved circuitry underlying social behaviors and processes such as social recognition and memory, social reward, and social approach/avoidance. Species exhibiting different complex social behaviors and social systems (such as social monogamy or familiarity preferences) can be characterized in part by when and how they display specific social behaviors. Prairie and meadow voles are closely related species that exhibit similarly selective peer preferences but different mating systems, aiding direct comparison of the mechanisms underlying affiliative behavior. This chapter draws on research in voles as well as other rodents to explore the mechanisms involved in individual social behavior processes, as well as specific complex social patterns. Contrasts between vole species exemplify how the laboratory study of diverse species improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social behavior. We identify several additional rodent species whose interesting social structures and available ecological and behavioral field data make them good candidates for study. New techniques and integration across laboratory and field settings will provide exciting opportunities for future mechanistic work in non-model species.

"BACKGROUND: Rickettsia species belonging to the spotted fever group (SFG) cause infections in humans, domestic animals and wildlife. At least ten SFG Rickettsia species are known to occur in China. However, the distribution of rickettsiae in ticks and fleas in the border region of northwestern China have not been systematically studied to date. RESULTS: A total of 982 ticks (Rhipicephalus turanicus, Dermacentor marginatus, D. nuttalli and Haemaphysalis punctata) and 5052 fleas (18 flea species from 14 species of wild mammals) were collected in ten and five counties, respectively, of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (northwestern China). Tick and flea species were identified according to morphological and molecular characteristics. Seven sets of primers for amplifying the 17-kDa antigen gene (17-kDa), citrate synthase gene (gltA), 16S rRNA gene (rrs), outer membrane protein A and B genes (ompA, ompB), surface cell antigen 1 gene (sca1) and PS120-protein encoding gene (gene D) were used to identify the species of rickettsiae. Nine Rickettsia species have been detected, seven of them in ticks: R. aeschlimannii, R. conorii, R. raoultii, Rickettsia sibirica, R. slovaca, R. massiliae and ""Candidatus R. barbariae"". In addition, R. bellii and two genotypes of a rickettsia endosymbiont (phylogenetically in an ancestral position to R. bellii) have been detected from flea pools. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides molecular evidence for the occurrence of several SFG rickettsiae in Rhipicephalus turanicus, Dermacentor nuttalli and D. marginatus. Furthermore, R. bellii and two ancestral rickettsia endosymbionts are present in fleas infesting wild rodents in the border regions of northwestern China. These data extend our knowledge on the diversity of rickettsiae in Central Asia.

"Regulation of the mechanisms of fibrosis is an important goal in the treatment of liver cirrhosis. One mechanism is the participation of hepatic stellate cells in fibrogenesis when activated by catecholamines. Consequently, α/β adrenoblockers are proposed as an alternative treatment for chronic liver lesions such as fibrosis and/or cirrhosis and for possible liver regeneration. We herein analyzed the effect of doxazosin and carvedilol treatments during the regeneration of tissue in a hamster model of liver cirrhosis. Tissue samples were examined by H&E and PAS to evaluate tissue damage and with Sirius red to assess collagen fiber content. ALT, AST, albumin, and total proteins were examined by spectrophotometry. Determination of the levels of α-SMA and TGF-β in hepatic tissue was examined by Western blot and of the expression of TIMP-2, MMP-13, α-FP, HGF, CK-7, and c-Myc was examined by qPCR. Treatment with doxazosin or carvedilol prompted histological recovery and reduced collagen fibers in the livers of cirrhotic hamsters. The expression of TIMP-2 decreased and that of MMP-13 increases in animals treated with adrenoblockers with respect to the group with cirrhosis. Additionally, the concentration of α-SMA and TGF-β declined with both drugs with respect to placebo p<0.05. On the other hand, each drug treatment led to a distinct scenario for cell proliferation markers. Whereas doxazosin produced no irregularities in α-FP, Ki-67, and c-Myc expression, carvedilol induced an increment in the expression of these markers with respect to the intact. Hence, doxazosin and carvedilol are potential treatments for the regression of hepatic cirrhosis in hamsters in relation to the decrease of collagen in the hepatic parenchyma. However, at regeneration level we observed that doxazosin caused slight morphological changes in hepatocytes, such as its balonization without affecting the hepatic function, and on the other hand, carvedilol elicited a slight irregular expression of cell proliferation markers.

"Stress, a ubiquitous part of daily human life, has varied biological effects which are increasingly recognized as including modulation of commensal microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, the gut microbiota. In turn, the gut microbiota influences the host stress response and associated sequelae, thereby implicating the gut microbiota as an important mediator of host health. This narrative review aims to summarize evidence concerning the impact of psychological, environmental, and physical stressors on gut microbiota composition and function. The stressors reviewed include psychological stress, circadian disruption, sleep deprivation, environmental extremes (high altitude, heat, and cold), environmental pathogens, toxicants, pollutants, and noise, physical activity, and diet (nutrient composition and food restriction). Stressors were selected for their direct relevance to military personnel, a population that is commonly exposed to these stressors, often at extremes, and in combination. However, the selected stressors are also common, alone or in combination, in some civilian populations. Evidence from preclinical studies collectively indicates that the reviewed stressors alter the composition, function and metabolic activity of the gut microbiota, but that effects vary across stressors, and can include effects that may be beneficial or detrimental to host health. Translation of these findings to humans is largely lacking at present. This gap precludes concluding with certainty that transient or cumulative exposures to psychological, environmental, and physical stressors have any consistent, meaningful impact on the human gut microbiota. However, provocative preclinical evidence highlights a need for translational research aiming to elucidate the impact of stressors on the human gut microbiota, and how the gut microbiota can be manipulated, for example by using nutrition, to mitigate adverse stress responses.

"The same nucleotide sequence can encode two protein products in different reading frames. Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains [Formula: see text] or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1). This can be explained by mutation bias favoring the frame with more start codons and fewer stop codons.

"There are at least 483 reports of carnivore apicomplexans in the literature citing 17 genera or generic categoriesthat have not been described sufficiently or there was so little information provided by the author(s), that their validity, and sometimes even their identity is in question. These include: 2 “Apicomplexa protozoa,” 1 Besnoitia sp., 34 Coccidia-like or Coccidia spp., 135 Cryptosporidium spp., 2 Cyclospora spp., 26 Cystoisospora spp., 36 Eimeria spp., 3 Hammondia-like forms; 7 Hammondia–Neospora-like forms; 7 Hammondia–Toxoplasma-like forms; 14 Hepatozoon spp., 1 Hoareosporidium sp., 72 Isospora spp., 1 Klossia sp., 1 “oocysts,” 135 Sarcocystis spp., and 3 Toxoplasma-like forms. All are considered species inquirendae. In addition, two names, Isospora novocati of Pellérdy, 1974b and Isospora mustelae of Galli-Valerio, 1932, are considered nomen nuda, by definition. There is no record that 37/72 (51%) Caniformia genera, and all their 60 species, and 37/54 (68.5%) Feliformia genera, and all their 49 species, have any of these abbreviated identifications attached to them because most, if not all, likely were never surveyed for intestinal coccidian parasites. And, in the 52 genera that have been surveyed, the vast majority of their 177 species have not yet been looked at for coccidia.

"Allometric relationships linking species characteristics to body size or mass (scaling) are important in biology. However, studies on the scaling of life history traits in the reptiles (the nonavian Reptilia) are rather scarce, especially for the clades Crocodilia, Testudines, and Rhynchocephalia (single extant species, the tuatara). Previous studies on the scaling of reptilian life history traits indicated that they differ from those seen in the other amniotes (mammals and birds), but so far most comparative studies used small species samples and also not phylogenetically informed analyses. Here, we analyzed the scaling of nine life history traits with adult body mass for crocodiles (n = 22), squamates (n = 294), turtles (n = 52), and reptiles (n = 369). We used for the first time a phylogenetically informed approach for crocodiles, turtles, and the whole group of reptiles. We explored differences in scaling relationships between the reptilian clades Crocodilia, Squamata, and Testudines as well as differences between reptiles, mammals, and birds. Finally, we applied our scaling relationships, in order to gain new insights into the degree of the exceptionality of the tuatara's life history within reptiles. We observed for none of the life history traits studied any difference in their scaling with body mass between squamates, crocodiles, and turtles, except for clutch size and egg weight showing small differences between these groups. Compared to birds and mammals, scaling relationships of reptiles were similar for time-related traits, but they differed for reproductive traits. The tuatara's life history is more similar to that of a similar-sized turtle or crocodile than to a squamate.

"BACKGROUND: Rabbits are cecotrophic, hindgut-fermenters that rely heavily on their gastrointestinal microbiota for optimal digestion of plant-based diets. Dysbiosis, caused by disruption of the gastrointestinal microbiota, is known to predispose rabbits to rabbit enteritis complex (REC), a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this study were to describe the fecal microbiota of domestic rabbits from a variety of settings (commercial meat, companion, laboratory, and shelter) and to identify how factors such as age, season, and routine antimicrobial use affect the fecal microbiota composition. RESULTS: A total of 86 pooled commercial meat, 54 companion, 14 pooled laboratory, and 14 shelter rabbit fecal samples were evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 region. In all sample types, the predominant bacterial phylum was Firmicutes. Other commonly identified phyla (composing ≥ 1% of the total microbiota composition) were Verrucomicrobia, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Significant differences in composition were noted between commercial, companion, laboratory, and shelter rabbit samples for proportions of Verrucomicrobia (P < 0.01), Proteobacteria (P < 0.01), and Lentisphaerae (P = 0.01) within the total microbiota. Within the commercial meat rabbit samples, significant differences between the microbiota composition of growers (n = 42) and does (n = 44) were limited to one unclassified Firmicutes (P = 0.03) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. Significant differences were present between fecal samples taken from rabbits during the summer (n = 44) compared to the winter (n = 42), with Firmicutes (P = 0.04), Verrucomicrobia (P = 0.03), Proteobacteria (P = 0.02), Deinococcus-Thermus (P = 0.04), Armatimonadates (P = 0.003), and Actinobacteria (P = 0.03) forming significantly different proportions of the microbiota. The only significant difference in composition between those farms that routinely reported antimicrobial use and those that did not was in one unclassified Bacteroidetes (P < 0.05) and no differences were identified at the phylum level. CONCLUSIONS: Rabbit husbandry and diet, in addition to season, significantly influence the fecal microbiota composition of domestic rabbits, while age of the rabbit post-weaning has minimal impact.

"A 3-year-old female Richardson's ground squirrel developed a subcutaneous mass at the left oral angle. Seven days after removal of the mass, the mass recurred and metastasized to the cervical lymph node. Histologically, the primary mass was subdivided by fibrous trabeculae into various-sized neoplastic cell lobules showing a solid growth pattern with frequent mitoses and sometimes forming intracytoplasmic lumina. Large to medium-sized lobules formed a central cyst plugged by comedo necrosis. Neoplastic cells showed infiltrative subcutaneous growth. In the recurrent tumor, tubular structures lacking apparent apocrine secretion appeared within the solid growth portion. Neutrophil infiltration was evident within the tubules and intracytoplasmic lumina. Neoplastic cells were diffusely immunopositive for AE1/AE3 pan-cytokeratin (CK) in all lobules and focally positive for CAM5.2 CK in the lobules forming a central cyst and/or tubular structures, but they entirely lacked positivity for the periodic acid Schiff reaction. Ki-67-positive proliferating neoplastic cells were higher in numbers with the recurrent tumor than with the primary tumor. In addition, phosphorylated c-MYC immunoreactivity was observed in neoplastic cell nuclei, distinctly at the portion of invasive growth. Thus, the present case was diagnosed as apocrine ductal carcinoma originating from the oral scent gland, which typically shows highly aggressive biological behavior.

"Few studies have ""quantitatively"" probed how adaptive mutations result in increased fitness. Even in simple microbial evolution experiments, with full knowledge of the underlying mutations and specific growth conditions, it is challenging to determine where within a growth-saturation cycle those fitness gains occur. A common implicit assumption is that most benefits derive from an increased exponential growth rate. Here, we instead show that, in batch serial transfer experiments, adaptive mutants' fitness gains can be dominated by benefits that are accrued in one growth cycle, but not realized until the next growth cycle. For thousands of evolved clones (most with only a single mutation), we systematically varied the lengths of fermentation, respiration, and stationary phases to assess how their fitness, as measured by barcode sequencing, depends on these phases of the growth-saturation-dilution cycles. These data revealed that, whereas all adaptive lineages gained similar and modest benefits from fermentation, most of the benefits for the highest fitness mutants came instead from the time spent in respiration. From monoculture and high-resolution pairwise fitness competition experiments for a dozen of these clones, we determined that the benefits ""accrued"" during respiration are only largely ""realized"" later as a shorter duration of lag phase in the following growth cycle. These results reveal hidden complexities of the adaptive process even under ostensibly simple evolutionary conditions, in which fitness gains can accrue during time spent in a growth phase with little cell division, and reveal that the memory of those gains can be realized in the subsequent growth cycle.

"The physiological impact of agricultural pollution, habitat disturbance, and food source variability on amphibian remains poorly understood. By comparing the composition and predicted functions of gut microbiota of two frog species from forest and farmland, we quantified the effects of the exogenous environment and endogenous filters on gut microbiota and the corresponding functions. However, compositional differences of the gut microbiota between the frog species were not detected, even when removing roughly 80-88% of the confounding effect produced by common and shared bacteria (i.e., generalists) and those taxa deemed too rare. The habitat effect accounted for 14.1% of the compositional difference of gut microbial specialists, but host and host × habitat effects were not significant. Similar trends of a significant habitat effect, at an even higher level (26.0%), for the physiological and metabolic functions of gut microbiota was predicted. A very obvious skewing of the relative abundance of functional groups toward farmland habitats reflects the highly diverse bacterial functions of farmland frogs, in particular related to pathogenic disease and pesticide degradation, which may be indication of poor adaptation or strong selective pressure against disease. These patterns reflect the impacts of agricultural activities on frogs and how such stresses may be applied in an unequal manner for different frog species.

"During wildlife tourism, proximity or actual contact between people and animals may lead to a significant risk of anthropozoonotic disease transmission. In this paper, we use social network analysis, disease simulation modelling and data on animal health and behaviour to investigate such risks at a site in Morocco, where tourists come to see wild Barbary macaques (Macaca sylvanus). Measures of individual macaques' network centrality-an index of the strength and distribution of their social relationships and thus potentially their ability to spread disease-did not show clear and consistent relationships with their time spent in close proximity to, or rate of interacting with, tourists. Disease simulation modelling indicated that while higher-ranked animals had a significantly greater ability to spread disease within the group, in absolute terms there was little difference in the size of outbreaks that different individuals were predicted to cause. We observed a high rate of physical contact and close proximity between humans and macaques, including during three periods when the macaques were coughing and sneezing heavily, highlighting the potential risk of disease transmission. We recommend that general disease prevention strategies, such as those aimed at reducing opportunities for contact between tourists and macaques, should be adopted.

"A wealth of human studies have demonstrated the importance of gut microbiota to health. Research on non-human animal gut microbiota is now increasing, but what insight does it provide? We reviewed 650 publications from this burgeoning field (2009-2016) and determined that animals driving this research were predominantly 'domestic' (48.2%), followed by 'model' (37.5%), with least studies on 'wild' (14.3%) animals. Domestic studies largely experimentally perturbed microbiota (81.8%) and studied mammals (47.9%), often to improve animal productivity. Perturbation was also frequently applied to model animals (87.7%), mainly mammals (88.1%), for forward translation of outcomes to human health. In contrast, wild animals largely characterised natural, unperturbed microbiota (79.6%), particularly in pest or pathogen vectoring insects (42.5%). We used network analyses to compare the research foci of each animal group: 'diet' was the main focus in all three, but to different ends: to enhance animal production (domestic), to study non-infectious diseases (model), or to understand microbiota composition (wild). Network metrics quantified model animal studies as the most interdisciplinary, while wild animals incorporated the fewest disciplines. Overall, animal studies, especially model and domestic, cover a broad array of research. Wild animals, however, are the least investigated, but offer under-exploited opportunities to study 'real-life' microbiota.

"Although it is generally believed that oxidative phosphorylation and adequate oxygenation are essential for life, human development occurs in a profoundly hypoxic environment and ""normal"" levels of oxygen during embryogenesis are even harmful. The ability of embryos not only to survive but also to thrive in such an environment is made possible by adaptations related to metabolic pathways. Similarly, cancerous cells are able not only to survive but also to grow and spread in environments that would typically be fatal for healthy adult cells. Many biological states, both normal and pathological, share underlying similarities related to metabolism, the electron transport chain, and reactive species. The purpose of Part I of this review is to review the similarities among embryogenesis, mammalian adaptions to hypoxia (primarily driven by hypoxia-inducible factor-1), ischemia-reperfusion injury (and its relationship with reactive oxygen species), hibernation, diving animals, cancer, and sepsis, with a particular focus on the common characteristics that allow cells and organisms to survive in these states.

"Contact networks, behavioral interactions, and shared use of space can all have important implications for the spread of disease in animals. Social networks enable the quantification of complex patterns of interactions; therefore, network analysis is becoming increasingly widespread in the study of infectious disease in animals, including wildlife. We present an introductory guide to using social-network-analytical approaches in wildlife disease ecology, epidemiology, and management. We focus on providing detailed practical guidance for the use of basic descriptive network measures by suggesting the research questions to which each technique is best suited and detailing the software available for each. We also discuss how using network approaches can be used beyond the study of social contacts and across a range of spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we integrate these approaches to examine how network analysis can be used to inform the implementation and monitoring of effective disease management strategies.

"Glucagon, secreted from islet alpha cells, plays an important role in regulating glucose homeostasis; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not fully understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are involved in the function of alpha cells. Glutamate promotes glucagon secretion by mediating the opening of Ca2+ channels. In this present, iGluR2 and iGluR3 levels were significantly increased in fasting-treated mouse islets. Additional studies showed that miR-124-3p simultaneously regulates the expression of iGluR2 and iGluR3 through the direct targeting of mRNA 3'UTR of these two genes. The miR-124-iGluRs pathway also contributed to the high level of glucagon secretion through long-term high glucose levels. Thus, a novel pathway comprising miRNA, glutamate and iGluRs has been demonstrated to regulate the biological process of glucagon release.

"Calpains are calcium-dependent proteolytic enzymes that have deleterious effects on neurons upon their pathological over-activation. According to the results of numerous studies to date, there is no doubt that abnormal calpain activation triggers activation and progression of apoptotic processes in neurodegeneration, leading to neuronal death. Thus, it is very crucial to unravel all the aspects of calpain-mediated neurodegeneration in order to protect neurons through eliminating or at least minimizing its lethal effects. Protecting neurons against calpain-activated apoptosis basically requires developing effective, reliable, and most importantly, therapeutically applicable approaches to succeed. From this aspect, the most significant studies focusing on preventing calpain-mediated neurodegeneration include blocking the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor activities, which are closely related to calpain activation; directly inhibiting calpain itself via intrinsic or synthetic calpain inhibitors, or inhibiting its downstream processes; and utilizing the neuroprotectant steroid hormone estrogen and its receptors. In this review, the most remarkable neuroprotective strategies for calpain-mediated neurodegeneration are categorized and summarized with respect to their advantages and disadvantages over one another, in terms of their efficiency and applicability as a therapeutic regimen in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a cosmopolitan infectious agent currently affecting over 350 million people worldwide, presently accounting for more than two billion infections. In addition to man, other hepatitis virus strains infect species of several mammalian families of the Primates, Rodentia and Chiroptera orders, in addition to birds. The mounting evidence of HBV infection in African, Asian and neotropical primates draws attention to the potential cross-species, zoonotic transmission of these viruses to man. Moreover, recent evidence also suggests the humans may also function as a source of viral infection to other mammals, particularly to domestic animals like poultry and swine. In this review, we list all evidence of HBV and HBV-like infection of nonhuman mammals and discuss their potential roles as donors or recipients of these viruses to humans and to other closely-related species.

"Disease is a major concern for the conservation of great apes, and one that is likely to become increasingly relevant as deforestation and the rise of ecotourism bring humans and apes into ever closer proximity. Consequently, it is imperative that preventative measures are explored to ensure that future epidemics do not wipe out the remaining populations of these animals. In this paper, social network analysis was used to investigate vulnerability to disease in a population of wild orang-utans and a community of wild chimpanzees. Potential 'superspreaders' of disease--individuals with disproportionately central positions in the community or population--were identified, and the efficacy of vaccinating these individuals assessed using simulations. Three resident female orang-utans were identified as potential superspreaders, and females and unflanged males were predicted to be more influential in disease spread than flanged males. By contrast, no superspreaders were identified in the chimpanzee network, although males were significantly more central than females. In both species, simulating the vaccination of the most central individuals in the network caused a greater reduction in potential disease pathways than removing random individuals, but this effect was considerably more pronounced for orang-utans. This suggests that targeted vaccinations would have a greater impact on reducing disease spread among orang-utans than chimpanzees. Overall, these results have important implications for orang-utan and chimpanzee conservation and highlight the role that certain individuals may play in the spread of disease and its prevention by vaccination.

"Seasonal fluctuations in food availability show a tight association with seasonal variations in body weight and food intake. Seasonal variations in food intake, energy storage, and expenditure appear to be a widespread phenomenon suggesting they may have evolved in anticipation for changing environmental demands. These cycles appear to be driven by changes in external daylength acting on neuroendocrine pathways. A number of neuroendocrine pathways, two of which are the endocrine mechanisms underlying feeding and stress, appear to show seasonal changes in both their circulating levels and reactivity. As such, variation in the level or reactivity to these hormones may be crucial factors in the control of seasonal variations in food-seeking behaviors. The present review examines the relationship between feeding behavior and seasonal changes in circulating hormones. We hypothesize that seasonal changes in circulating levels of glucocorticoids and the feeding-related hormones ghrelin and leptin contribute to seasonal fluctuations in feeding-related behaviors. This review will focus on the seasonal circulating levels of these hormones as well as sensitivity to these hormones in the modulation of food-seeking behaviors.

"There is increasing evidence that individuals in many species avoid areas exposed to chronic anthropogenic noise, but the impact of noise on those who remain in these habitats is unclear. One potential impact is chronic physiological stress, which can affect disease resistance, survival and reproductive success. Previous studies have found evidence of elevated stress-related hormones (glucocorticoids) in wildlife exposed to human activities, but the impacts of noise alone are difficult to separate from confounding factors. Here we used an experimental playback study to isolate the impacts of noise from industrial activity (natural gas drilling and road noise) on glucocorticoid levels in greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of conservation concern. We non-invasively measured immunoreactive corticosterone metabolites from fecal samples (FCMs) of males on both noise-treated and control leks (display grounds) in two breeding seasons. We found strong support for an impact of noise playback on stress levels, with 16.7% higher mean FCM levels in samples from noise leks compared with samples from paired control leks. Taken together with results from a previous study finding declines in male lek attendance in response to noise playbacks, these results suggest that chronic noise pollution can cause greater sage-grouse to avoid otherwise suitable habitat, and can cause elevated stress levels in the birds who remain in noisy areas.

"Bartonella infections were investigated in bats in the Amazon part of Peru. A total of 112 bats belonging to 19 species were surveyed. Bartonella bacteria were cultured from 24.1% of the bats (27/112). Infection rates ranged from 0% to 100% per bat species. Phylogenetic analyses of gltA of the Bartonella isolates revealed 21 genetic variants clustering into 13 divergent phylogroups. Some Bartonella strains were shared by bats of multiple species, and bats of some species were infected with multiple Bartonella strains, showing no evident specific Bartonella sp.-bat relationships. Rarely found in other bat species, the Bartonella strains of phylogroups I and III discovered from the common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) were more specific to the host bat species, suggesting some level of host specificity.

"This review summarizes the brain mechanisms controlling sleep and wakefulness. Wakefulness promoting systems cause low-voltage, fast activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Multiple interacting neurotransmitter systems in the brain stem, hypothalamus, and basal forebrain converge onto common effector systems in the thalamus and cortex. Sleep results from the inhibition of wake-promoting systems by homeostatic sleep factors such as adenosine and nitric oxide and GABAergic neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, resulting in large-amplitude, slow EEG oscillations. Local, activity-dependent factors modulate the amplitude and frequency of cortical slow oscillations. Non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep results in conservation of brain energy and facilitates memory consolidation through the modulation of synaptic weights. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep results from the interaction of brain stem cholinergic, aminergic, and GABAergic neurons which control the activity of glutamatergic reticular formation neurons leading to REM sleep phenomena such as muscle atonia, REMs, dreaming, and cortical activation. Strong activation of limbic regions during REM sleep suggests a role in regulation of emotion. Genetic studies suggest that brain mechanisms controlling waking and NREM sleep are strongly conserved throughout evolution, underscoring their enormous importance for brain function. Sleep disruption interferes with the normal restorative functions of NREM and REM sleep, resulting in disruptions of breathing and cardiovascular function, changes in emotional reactivity, and cognitive impairments in attention, memory, and decision making.

"This paper presents many types of interplays between parasites and the host, showing the history of parasites, the effects of parasites on the outcome of wars, invasions, migrations, and on the development of numerous regions of the globe, and the impact of parasitic diseases on the society and on the course of human evolution. It also emphasizes the pressing need to change the look at the parasitism phenomenon, proposing that the term ""cohabitant"" is more accurate than parasite, because every living being, from bacteria to mammals, is a consortium of living beings in the pangenome. Even the term parasitology should be replaced by cohabitology because there is no parasite alone and host alone: both together compose a new adaptive system: the parasitized-host or the cohabitant-cohabited being. It also suggests switching the old paradigm based on attrition and destruction, to a new one founded on adaptation and living together.

"Social interactions among conspecifics are a fundamental and adaptively significant component of the biology of numerous species. Such interactions give rise to group living as well as many of the complex forms of cooperation and conflict that occur within animal groups. Although previous conceptual models have focused on the ecological causes and fitness consequences of variation in social interactions, recent developments in endocrinology, neuroscience, and molecular genetics offer exciting opportunities to develop more integrated research programs that will facilitate new insights into the physiological causes and consequences of social variation. Here, we propose an integrative framework of social behavior that emphasizes relationships between ultimate-level function and proximate-level mechanism, thereby providing a foundation for exploring the full diversity of factors that underlie variation in social interactions, and ultimately sociality. In addition to identifying new model systems for the study of human psychopathologies, this framework provides a mechanistic basis for predicting how social behavior will change in response to environmental variation. We argue that the study of non-model organisms is essential for implementing this integrative model of social behavior because such species can be studied simultaneously in the lab and field, thereby allowing integration of rigorously controlled experimental manipulations with detailed observations of the ecological contexts in which interactions among conspecifics occur.

"The first virus-like particle to be tested for use as a vaccine carrier was based on the hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid protein. This viral subunit, while not infectious on its own, is a 36-nm particle that is highly immunogenic during a natural infection. The self-assembly and high degree of immunogenicity is maintained when expressed as a recombinant protein and, moreover, can confer a high degree of immunogenicity on foreign antigens linked to the particle, either chemically or genetically. This review describes the current state of the hepadnaviral core protein as a vaccine carrier.

"Disease-mediated inbreeding depression is a potential cost of living in groups with kin, but its general magnitude in wild populations is unclear. We examined the relationships between inbreeding, survival and disease for 312 offspring, produced by 35 parental pairs, in a large, open population of cooperatively breeding American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos). Genetic analyses of parentage, parental relatedness coefficients and pedigree information suggested that 23 per cent of parental dyads were first- or second-order kin. Heterozygosity-heterozygosity correlations suggested that a microsatellite-based index of individual heterozygosity predicted individual genome-wide heterozygosity in this population. After excluding birds that died traumatically, survival probability was lower for relatively inbred birds during the 2-50 months after banding: the hazard rate for the most inbred birds was 170 per cent higher than that for the least inbred birds across the range of inbreeding index values. Birds that died with disease symptoms had higher inbreeding indices than birds with other fates. Our results suggest that avoidance of close inbreeding and the absence of inbreeding depression in large, open populations should not be assumed in taxa with kin-based social systems, and that microsatellite-based indices of individual heterozygosity can be an appropriate tool for examining the inbreeding depression in populations where incest and close inbreeding occur.

"Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease of nearly worldwide distribution. The occurrence of the infection in humans is largely dependent on the prevalence of brucellosis in animal reservoirs, including wildlife. The current vaccine used for cattle Brucella abortus strain RB51, has proven ineffective in protecting bison (Bison bison) and elk (Cervus nelsoni) from infection and abortion. To test possible improvements in vaccine efficacy, a novel approach of immunization was examined from April 2004 to November 2006 using alginate composite microspheres containing a nonimmunogenic, eggshell-precursor protein of the parasite Fasciola hepatica (Vitelline protein B, VpB) to deliver live vaccine strain RB51. Red deer (Cervus elaphus), used as a model for elk, were vaccinated orally (PO) or subcutaneously (SC) with 1.5x10(10) viable organisms per animal. Humoral responses postvaccination (immunoglobulin G [IgG] levels), assessed at different time points, indicated that capsules containing live RB51 elicited an anti-Brucella specific IgG response. Furthermore, the encapsulated vaccine elicited a cell-mediated response that the nonencapsulated vaccinates failed to produce. Finally, red deer were challenged with B. abortus strain 19 by conjunctival exposure. Only animals that received encapsulated RB51 vaccine by either route exhibited a significant reduction in bacterial counts in their spleens. These data suggest that alginate-VpB microspheres provide a method to enhance the RB51 vaccine performance in elk.

"DDB1 was isolated as a UV-damaged DNA-binding protein, but recent studies established that it plays a role as a component of cullin 4A ubiquitin ligases. Cullin-RING complexes are the largest known ubiquitin ligase family, with hundreds of substrate-specific adaptor subunits and which are defined by characteristic motifs. A common motif for DDB1/cullin 4 ubiquitin ligases, a WDXR motif, was recently reported. Here, we show that Schizosaccharomyces pombe Ddb1 associates with several WD40 repeat proteins that share a novel protein motif designated the DDB-box, a motif essential for interaction with Ddb1 and independent of WD40 repeats, unlike the WDXR motif. We also show that ddb1(+) and the putative CSA homolog ckn1(+) are involved in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair and that the DDB-box is essential for the ckn1(+) function in vivo. These data indicate that the DDB-box is another common motif which defines adaptor proteins for DDB1/cullin 4 ubiquitin ligases.

"Much of the permanent damage that occurs in response to nervous system damage (trauma, infection, ischemia, etc.) is mediated by endogenous secondary processes that can contribute to cell death and tissue damage (excitotoxicity, oxidative damage and inflammation). For humans to evolve mechanisms to minimize secondary pathophysiological events following CNS injuries, selection must occur for individuals who survive such insults. Two major factors limit the selection for beneficial responses to CNS insults: for many CNS disease states the principal risk factor is advanced, post-reproductive age and virtually all severe CNS traumas are fatal in the absence of modern medical intervention. An alternative hypothesis for the persistence of apparently maladaptive responses to CNS damage is that the secondary exacerbation of damage is the result of unavoidable evolutionary constraints. That is, the nervous system could not function under normal conditions if the mechanisms that caused secondary damage (e.g., excitotoxicity) in response to injury were decreased or eliminated. However, some vertebrate species normally inhabit environments (e.g., hypoxia in underground burrows) that could potentially damage their nervous systems. Yet, neuroprotective mechanisms have evolved in these animals indicating that natural selection can occur for traits that protect animals from nervous system damage. Many of the secondary processes and regeneration-inhibitory factors that exacerbate injuries likely persist because they have been adaptive over evolutionary time in the healthy nervous system. Therefore, it remains important that researchers consider the role of the processes in the healthy or developing nervous system to understand how they become dysregulated following injury.

"The microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer disease and other tauopathies, and is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. While the mechanisms leading to abnormal tau phosphorylation remain elusive, the recent demonstration of reversible tau phosphorylation during hibernation provides an ideal physiological model to study this critical process in vivo. In this study, Arctic ground squirrels (AGS) during hibernation were used to study mechanisms related to tau hyperphosphorylation. Our data demonstrate that tau is hyperphosphorylated at all six sites (S199, T205, S214, S262, S396, and S404) examined in hibernating AGS. Interestingly, only three of these sites (S199, S262, and S404) are dephosphorylated in aroused animals, suggesting a reversible phosphorylation at selective sites. Summer-active AGS demonstrated the lowest tau phosphorylation at all these sites. To explore the mechanisms underlying increased tau phosphorylation during hibernation, the expression level and enzyme activity of various potential tau kinases and protein phosphatases were examined. The kinetic analysis of enzyme activity at different temperatures revealed differential changes in enzyme activity with temperature decline. Specifically, increased protein kinase A activity, decreased protein phosphatase 2A activity, as well as substantial contribution from glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, likely play a key role in increased tau phosphorylation during hibernation in AGS.

"In rodents, where chemical signals play a particularly important role in determining intraspecies interactions including social dominance and intersexual relationships, various studies have shown that behavior is sensitive to conspecific odor cues. Mice use urinary scent marks for communication with individual conspecifics in many social contexts. Urinary scent involves genetic information about individuals such as species, sex, and individual identity as well as metabolic information such as social dominance, and reproductive and health status, which are mediated by chemical proteins in scent marks including the major histocompatibility complex and the major urinary proteins. The odor of the predator which can be considered to be a threatening signal for the prey also modulate mouse behavior in which scent marking is suppressed in response to the cat odor exposure in mice. These odorant chemicals are detected and recognized through two olfactory bulbs, the role of which in detection of chemosignals with biological relevant appears to be differential, but partly overlapped. Mice deposit scent marks toward conspecifics to maintain their social relationships, and inhibit scent marking in a context where natural predator, cat odor is contained. This suppression of scent marking is long-lasting (for at least 7 days) and context-dependent, while the odorant signaling to conspecifics tends to appear frequently (over 24h but less than 7 days intervals) depending on the familiarity of each signal-recipient. It has been discussed that scent marking is a communicative behavior associated with territoriality toward conspecifics, indicating that the social signaling within species are sensitive to predator odor cues in terms of vulnerability to predation risk.

"The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence estimating an impact of occupational factors on mood disorders and suicide, and the efficacy of interventions. This review is based on literature searches using Medline and Psych INFO from 1966 to 2007 (keywords: work stress, job insecurity, job strain, shift work, violence, occupational health, mood disorders, depression, and suicide). To establish the relationship between occupational variables and mood disorders, we focused on clinically significant disorders rather than depressive symptoms. During the last decade, prospective epidemiological studies have suggested a predictive association between the work environment and mood disorders. Recently, increasing numbers of clinical trials have shown favorable effect size of intervention and suggested preferable return-on-investment results. However, low awareness and social stigma still decrease workers access to treatment. Mental health professionals in conjunction with employers have to devise a creative system to make the quality care being offered more accessible to employees. In addition, further outcome data is needed to evaluate the benefit of managing mood disorders in the workplace, and to foster awareness of positive implications for employees, employers, their families, and the society at large. In addition, the work environment, with its chemical (e.g. chemosensory factors, pollutants), physical (e.g. lighting, noise, temperature, outdoor views and activities), biological (e.g., chronobiological factors, allergens, infectious agents), psychological (e.g. demand-control, effort-reward balance), social (e.g. cohesiveness, support), and organizational (e.g. leadership styles) component should meet minimal standards, and may improve with striving towards the optimum.

"DNA microarrays offer the possibility of testing for the presence of thousands of micro-organisms in a single experiment. However, there is a lack of reliable bioinformatics tools for the analysis of such data. We have developed DetectiV, a package for the statistical software R. DetectiV offers powerful yet simple visualization, normalization and significance testing tools. We show that DetectiV performs better than previously published software on a large, publicly available dataset.

"DNA microarrays may be used to identify microbial species present in environmental and clinical samples. However, automated tools for reliable species identification based on observed microarray hybridization patterns are lacking. We present an algorithm, E-Predict, for microarray-based species identification. E-Predict compares observed hybridization patterns with theoretical energy profiles representing different species. We demonstrate the application of the algorithm to viral detection in a set of clinical samples and discuss its relevance to other metagenomic applications.

"The exploration of many of the fundamental features of mammalian behavioral neuroendocrinology has benefited greatly throughout the short history of the discipline from the study of highly inbred, genetically characterized rodents and several other ""traditional"" exemplars. More recently, the impact of genomic variation in the determination of complex neuroendocrine and behavioral systems has advanced through the use of single and multiple gene knockouts or knockins. In our essay, we argue that the study of nontraditional mammals is an essential approach that complements these methodologies by taking advantage of allelic variation produced by natural selection. Current and future research will continue to exploit these systems to great advantage and will bring new techniques developed in more traditional laboratory animals to bear on problems that can only be addressed with nontraditional species. We highlight our points by discussing advances in our understanding of neuroendocrine and behavioral systems in phenomena of widely differing time scales. These examples include neuroendocrine variation in the regulation of reproduction across seasons in Peromyscus, variation in parental care by biparental male rodents and primates within a single infant rearing attempt, and circadian variation in the regulation of the substrates underlying mating in diurnal vs. nocturnal rodents. Our essay reveals both important divergences in neuroendocrine systems in our nontraditional model species, and important commonalities in these systems.

"AIM: A strategy for viral vaccine design is the use of conserved peptides to overcome the problem of sequence diversity. At present it is still unclear whether conserved peptide is safe as a candidate vaccine. We reported it here for the first time not only to highlight the biohazard issue and safety importance for viral peptide vaccine, but also to explore the effect of a fully conserved peptide on HBV replication within the carboxyl terminus of HBx. METHODS: We synthesized the fully conserved peptide (CP) with nine residues, FVLGGCRHK. HBV-producing 2.2.15 cells were treated with or without 3.5 microM CP for 36 hours. Quantitative detection of viral DNA was performed by real-time PCR. HBV antigens were determined by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). Quantitative analyses of p53 and Bax proteins were based on immunofluorescence. Flow cytometry was performed to detect cell cycle and apoptosis. RESULTS: Both extracellular and intracellular copies of HBV DNA per ml were significantly increased after incubation with 3.5 microM of CP. HBsAg and HBeAg in the cultured medium of CP-treatment cells were as abundant as untreated control cells. CP influenced negatively the extracellular viral gene products, and 3.5 microM CP could significantly inhibit intracellular HBsAg expression. In response to CP, intracellular HBeAg displayed an opposite pattern to that of HBsAg, and 3.5 microM CP could efficiently increase the level of intracellular HBeAg. Flow cytometric analyses exhibited no significant changes on cell cycle, apoptosis, p53 and Bax proteins in 2.2.15 cells with or without CP. CONCLUSION: Together with the results generated from the synthetic peptide, we address that the conserved region, a domain of HBx, may be responsible for modulating HBV replication. As conserved peptides from infectious microbes are used as immunogens to elicit immune responses, their latent biological hazard for human beings should be evaluated.

"The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) control circadian oscillations of physiology and behavior. Measurements of electrical activity and of gene expression indicate that these heterogeneous structures are composed of both rhythmic and nonrhythmic cells. A fundamental question with regard to the organization of the circadian system is how the SCN achieve a coherent output while their constituent independent cellular oscillators express a wide range of periods. Previously, the consensus output of individual oscillators had been attributed to coupling among cells. The authors propose a model that incorporates nonrhythmic ""gate"" cells and rhythmic oscillator cells with a wide range of periods, that neither requires nor excludes a role for interoscillator coupling. The gate provides daily input to oscillator cells and is in turn regulated (directly or indirectly) by the oscillator cells. In the authors' model, individual oscillators with initial random phases are able to self-assemble so as to maintain cohesive rhythmic output. In this view, SCN circuits are important for self-sustained oscillation, and their network properties distinguish these nuclei from other tissues that rhythmically express clock genes. The model explains how individual SCN cells oscillate independently and yet work together to produce a coherent rhythm.

"Hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B viruses) cause transient and chronic infections of the liver. Transient infections run a course of several months, and chronic infections are often lifelong. Chronic infections can lead to liver failure with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The replication strategy of these viruses has been described in great detail, but virus-host interactions leading to acute and chronic disease are still poorly understood. Studies on how the virus evades the immune response to cause prolonged transient infections with high-titer viremia and lifelong infections with an ongoing inflammation of the liver are still at an early stage, and the role of the virus in liver cancer is still elusive. The state of knowledge in this very active field is therefore reviewed with an emphasis on past accomplishments as well as goals for the future.

"Information was collected on confirmed outbreaks of western equine encephalitis (WEE) in North America east of the Rockies for 1981 and 1983 (epidemic years) and 1980 and 1982 (non-epidemic years). The initial pattern of outbreaks in Manitoba, Minnesota and North Dakota was determined for each year. Backward (and in some instances forward) wind trajectories were computed for each day 4-15 days (incubation period) before the initial outbreaks of WEE in a given area of province or state. During these years the timing and location of WEE outbreaks in horses and man, seroconversion in chickens, the maximum Culex tarsalis counts at Winnipeg and first isolation of WEE virus from C. tarsalis could be correlated with trajectories of winds from states further south within acceptable intervals. It is suggested that C. tarsalis mosquitoes infected with WEE virus are carried on the wind from Texas on the Gulf of Mexico, where they continue to breed during the northern winter months, to northern Texas and Oklahoma in the spring. In May, June and July C. tarsalis are carried north on southerly winds from these states through Kansas and Nebraska to North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Manitoba. Distances of 1250-1350 km are traversed in 18-24 h at heights up to 1.5 km with temperatures greater than or equal to 13 degrees C. Landing takes place where the warm southerly winds meet cold fronts associated with rain. Convergence leads to concentration of C. tarsalis and determines where outbreaks occur. It is possible that return of new generations of C. tarsalis to the south may occur later in the year. The development of an epidemic of WEE in the northern states and provinces would appear to depend on (i) suitable trajectories from the south in June and July with temperatures greater than or equal to 13 degrees C meeting cold fronts with rain, (ii) sufficient C. tarsalis infected with WEE virus at source, carried on the wind and locally, (iii) C. tarsalis biting horses and man, (iv) maintenance of local mosquito populations in August and (v) susceptible hosts (birds) at source and susceptible hosts (horses and man) locally. Possible methods of prediction involving determination of trajectories, identification of C. tarsalis blood meals, measuring seroconversion in calves are discussed in addition to the methods already in use.

"Urban environments are among the fastest changing habitats on the planet, and this change has evolutionary implications for the organisms inhabiting them. Herein, we demonstrate that natural history collections are critical resources for urban evolution studies. The specimens housed in these collections provide great potential for diverse types of urban evolution research, and strategic deposition of specimens and other materials from contemporary studies will determine the resources and research questions available to future urban evolutionary biologists. As natural history collections are windows into the past, they provide a crucial historical timescale for urban evolution research. While the importance of museum collections for research is generally appreciated, their utility in the study of urban evolution has not been explicitly evaluated. Here, we: (a) demonstrate that museum collections can greatly enhance urban evolution studies, (b) review patterns of specimen use and deposition in the urban evolution literature, (c) analyze how urban versus rural and native versus nonnative vertebrate species are being deposited in museum collections, and (d) make recommendations to researchers, museum professionals, scientific journal editors, funding agencies, permitting agencies, and professional societies to improve archiving policies. Our analyses of recent urban evolution studies reveal that museum specimens can be used for diverse research questions, but they are used infrequently. Further, although nearly all studies we analyzed generated resources that could be deposited in natural history collections (e.g., collected specimens), a minority (12%) of studies actually did so. Depositing such resources in collections is crucial to allow the scientific community to verify, replicate, and/or re-visit prior research. Therefore, to ensure that adequate museum resources are available for future urban evolutionary biology research, the research community-from practicing biologists to funding agencies and professional societies-must make adjustments that prioritize the collection and deposition of urban specimens.

"Quantifying the costs of mating is key for understanding life-history trade-offs. As a reflection of metabolic rate, body temperature is one metric for assaying these costs. However, conventional methods for measuring body temperature are invasive and unsuitable for the study of free-living populations of endangered species, including great apes. A promising proxy for body temperature is fecal temperature, the internal temperature of fecal deposits shortly following defecation. We validated this method with humans, finding that maximum fecal temperature is a reliable proxy for rectal temperature. We then applied this method to wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) at Ngogo, Kibale National Park, Uganda. We collected and analyzed 101 fecal temperature measurements from 43 adult chimpanzees (male: N = 28; female: N = 15). Chimpanzee fecal temperature ranged from 33.4 to 38.9 °C, with a mean of 35.8 °C. Although fecal temperature was not predicted by sex, age, or ambient temperature, male fecal temperature was 1.1 °C higher on days when sexually receptive females were present and was positively correlated with male dominance rank. Post hoc analyses showed that overall copulation rates, but not aggression rates, were positively correlated with fecal temperature, suggesting that sexual physiology and behavior best explain mating-related temperature variation. Together, these results indicate fecal temperature is a reliable proxy for core body temperature in large-bodied mammals, captures metabolic costs associated with male mating behavior, and represents a valuable noninvasive tool for biological field research.

"Species distribution and endangerment can be assessed by habitat-suitability modelling. This study addresses methodical aspects of habitat suitability modelling and includes an application example in actual species conservation and landscape planning. Models using species presence-absence data are preferable to presence-only models. In contrast to species presence data, absences are rarely recorded. Therefore, many studies generate pseudo-absence data for modelling. However, in this study model quality was higher with null samples collected in the field. Next to species data the choice of landscape data is crucial for suitability modelling. Landscape data with high resolution and ecological relevance for the study species improve model reliability and quality for small elusive mammals like Muscardinus avellanarius. For large scale assessment of species distribution, models with low-detailed data are sufficient. For regional site-specific conservation issues like a conflict-free site for new wind turbines, high-detailed regional models are needed. Even though the overlap with optimally suitable habitat for M. avellanarius was low, the installation of wind plants can pose a threat due to habitat loss and fragmentation. To conclude, modellers should clearly state the purpose of their models and choose the according level of detail for species and environmental data.

"Over the last 50 years, significant muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) harvest declines have been observed throughout North America. Several theories for the decline have been proposed, including increased parasite infections and disease within muskrat populations. No existing wholistic review of muskrat exposure to pathogens, contaminants, and diseases exists. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a thorough review of existing literature on muskrat pathogens, contaminants, and diseases across their natural range. This review is comprised of 131 articles from 1915 to 2019 and from 27 U.S. states and 9 Canadian provinces. A wide diversity of contaminants, toxins, and pathogens were reported in muskrats, with the most common diseases being cysticercosis, tularemia, Tyzzer's disease, and biotoxin poisoning from cyanobacteria. This review provides a summary of muskrat pathogens, contaminants, and diseases over a century that has observed significant population declines throughout the species' range in North America. Such data provide a baseline for understanding the potential role of disease in these declines. In addition, these data highlight critical knowledge gaps that warrant future research efforts.

"Satellite cells are the myogenic stem and progenitor population found in skeletal muscle. These cells typically reside in a quiescent state until called upon to support repair, regeneration, or muscle growth. The activities of satellite cells are orchestrated by systemic hormones, autocrine and paracrine growth factors, and the composition of the basal lamina of the muscle fiber. Several key intracellular signaling events are initiated in response to changes in the local environment causing exit from quiescence, proliferation, and differentiation. Signals emanating from Notch, wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family members, and transforming growth factor-β proteins mediate the reversible exit from growth 0 phase while those initiated by members of the fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor families direct proliferation and differentiation. Many of these pathways impinge upon the myogenic regulatory factors (MRF), myogenic factor 5, myogenic differentiation factor D, myogenin and MRF4, and the lineage determinate, Paired box 7, to alter transcription and subsequent satellite cell decisions. In the recent past, insight into mouse transgenic models has led to a firm understanding of regulatory events that control satellite cell metabolism and myogenesis. Many of these niche-regulated functions offer subtle differences from their counterparts in livestock pointing to the existence of species-specific controls. The purpose of this review is to examine the mechanisms that mediate large animal satellite cell activity and their relationship to those present in rodents.

"It is generally believed that diseases caused by oxidative stress should be treated with antioxidants. However, clinical trials with such antioxidants as ascorbic acid and vitamin E, failed to produce the expected beneficial results. On the other hand, important biomolecules can be modified by the introduction of oxygen atoms by means of non-oxidative hydroxyl radicals. In addition, hydroxyl radicals can reduce disulfide bonds in proteins, specifically fibrinogen, resulting in their unfolding and scrambled refolding into abnormal spatial configurations. Consequences of this reaction are observed in many diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer and neurological disorders, and can be prevented by the action of non-reducing substances. Moreover, many therapeutic substances, traditionally classified as antioxidants, accept electrons and thus are effective oxidants. It is described in this paper that hydroxyl radicals can be generated by ferric ions without any oxidizing agent. In view of the well-known damaging effect of poorly chelated iron in the human body, numerous natural products containing iron binding agents can be essential in the maintenance of human health. However, beneficial effects of the great number of phytochemicals that are endowed with hydroxyl radical scavenging and/or iron chelating activities should not be considered as a proof for oxidative stress.

"Food consumption during the rest phase promotes circadian desynchrony, which is corrected with harmful physiological and mental disorders. Previously, we found that circadian desynchrony was involved in isoflurane-induced cognitive impairment. Here, we scheduled food access to modulate daily rhythm to examine its impact on isoflurane-induced cognitive impairments. Mice were randomly transferred to restricted feeding (RF) time groups: Control group (Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0-ZT24, ad libitum feeding), Day-Feeding group (ZT0-ZT12, misaligned feeding), and Night-Feeding group (ZT12-ZT24, aligned feeding). Then, some of them were subjected to 5 h of 1.3% isoflurane anaesthesia from ZT14 to ZT19 and were divided into the Control + Anes group, the Day-Feeding + Anes group, and the Night-Feeding + Anes group. Mini-Mitter was used to monitor the daily rhythm. Fear conditioning system was conducted to assess cognition of mice. We observed that the Night-Feeding group adapted to RF gradually, whereas the Day-Feeding group exhibited a disturbed daily rhythm. The Night-Feeding + Anes group exhibited a partially enhanced daily rhythm, whereas the Day-Feeding + Anes group exhibited sustained phase advances and diurnality score increase 7 days after isoflurane anaesthesia. Notably, in tests of hippocampus-dependent contextual memory, the Night-Feeding + Anes group demonstrated decreased deficits; the Day-Feeding + Anes group showed prolonged post-anaesthetic deficits 14 days after isoflurane anaesthesia. However, amygdala-dependent cued-fear conditioning post-anaesthesia was not altered by the RF schedule. In conclusion, we demonstrated that misaligned feeding disturbed the daily rhythm and led to persistent post-anaesthetic cognitive dysfunction. Aligned feeding enhanced the daily rhythm partially and improved post-anaesthetic cognitive dysfunction.

"Circadian clocks have important physiological and behavioral functions in humans and other organisms, which enable organisms to anticipate and respond to periodic environmental changes. Disturbances in circadian rhythms impair sleep, metabolism, and behavior. People with jet lag, night workers and shift workers are vulnerable to circadian misalignment. In addition, non-24-h cycles influence circadian rhythms and cause misalignment and disorders in different species, since these periods are beyond the entrainment ranges. In certain special conditions, e.g., on submarines and commercial ships, non-24-h watch schedules are often employed, which have also been demonstrated to be deleterious to circadian rhythms. Personnel working under such conditions suffer from circadian misalignment with their on-watch hours, leading to increased health risks and decreased cognitive performance. In this review, we summarize the research progress and knowledge concerning circadian rhythms on submarines and other environments in which non-24-h watch schedules are employed.

"Circadian rhythm is a universal life phenomenon that plays an important role in maintaining the multiple physiological functions and regulating the adaptability to internal and external environments of flora and fauna. Circadian alignment in humans has the greatest effect on human health, and circadian misalignment is closely associated with increased risk for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, immune diseases, cancer, sleep disorders, and ophthalmic diseases. The recent description of clock proteins and related post-modification targets was involved in several diseases, and numerous lines of evidence are emerging that small molecule modulators of circadian rhythms can be used to rectify circadian disorder. Herein, we attempt to update the disclosures about the modulators targeting core clock proteins and related post-modification targets, as well as the relationship between circadian rhythm disorders and human health as well as the therapeutic role and prospect of these small molecule modulators in circadian rhythm related disease.

"This chapter presents a survey of zoonotic microorganisms that have been isolated from vertebrates (Vertebrata), and are potentially transmissible to humans. It is intended as an aid for microbiologists, zoologists and epidemiologists, making possible better orientation among hosts (and reservoirs) of zoonoses. A great number of sources have been used in this compilation, e.g. Davis et al. (1970), Kucheruk (1979, 1989), Karabatsos (1985–1995), Hubálek (1994), etc.

"Homeotherms maintain a stable internal body temperature despite changing environments. During energy deficiency, some species can cease to defend their body temperature and enter a hypothermic and hypometabolic state known as torpor. Recent advances have revealed the medial preoptic area (MPA) as a key site for the regulation of torpor in mice. The MPA is estrogen-sensitive and estrogens also have potent effects on both temperature and metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that estrogen-sensitive neurons in the MPA can coordinate hypothermia and hypometabolism in mice. Selectively activating estrogen-sensitive MPA neurons was sufficient to drive a coordinated depression of metabolic rate and body temperature similar to torpor, as measured by body temperature, physical activity, indirect calorimetry, heart rate, and brain activity. Inducing torpor with a prolonged fast revealed larger and more variable calcium transients from estrogen-sensitive MPA neurons during bouts of hypothermia. Finally, whereas selective ablation of estrogen-sensitive MPA neurons demonstrated that these neurons are required for the full expression of fasting-induced torpor in both female and male mice, their effects on thermoregulation and torpor bout initiation exhibit differences across sex. Together, these findings suggest a role for estrogen-sensitive MPA neurons in directing the thermoregulatory and metabolic responses to energy deficiency.

"Adaptive protein evolution may be facilitated by neutral amino acid mutations that confer no benefit when they first arise but which potentiate subsequent function-altering mutations via direct or indirect structural mechanisms. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that such compensatory interactions (intramolecular epistasis) can exert a strong influence on trajectories of protein evolution. For this reason, assessing the form and prevalence of intramolecular epistasis and characterizing biophysical mechanisms of compensatory interaction are important research goals at the nexus of structural biology and molecular evolution. Here I review recent insights derived from protein-engineering studies, and I describe an approach for identifying and characterizing mechanisms of epistasis that integrates experimental data on structure-function relationships with analyses of comparative sequence data.

"AMP kinase (AMPK) is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme required for adaptive responses to various physiological and pathological conditions. AMPK executes numerous cellular functions, some of which are often perceived at odds with each other. While AMPK is essential for embryonic growth and development, its full impact in adult tissues is revealed under stressful situations that organisms face in the real world. Conflicting reports about its cellular functions, particularly in cancer, are intriguing and a growing number of AMPK activators are being developed to treat human diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Whether these drugs will have only context-specific benefits or detrimental effects in the treatment of human cancer will be a subject of intense research. Here we review the current state of AMPK research with an emphasis on cancer and discuss the yet unresolved context-dependent functions of AMPK in human cancer.

"Ticks are important vectors that transmit several pathogens including human anaplasmosis agent, Anaplasma phagocytophilum. This bacterium is an obligate intracellular rickettsial pathogen. An infected reservoir animal host is often required for maintenance of this bacterial colony and as a source for blood to perform needle inoculations in naïve animals for tick feeding studies. In this study, we report an efficient microinjection method to generate A. phagocytophilum-infected ticks in laboratory conditions. The dense-core (DC) form of A. phagocytophilum was isolated from in vitro cultures and injected into the anal pore of unfed uninfected Ixodes scapularis nymphal ticks. These ticks successfully transmitted A. phagocytophilum to the murine host. The bacterial loads were detected in murine blood, spleen, and liver tissues. In addition, larval ticks successfully acquired A. phagocytophilum from mice that were previously infected by feeding with DC-microinjected nymphal ticks. Transstadial transmission of A. phagocytophilum from larvae to nymphal stage was also evident in these ticks. Taken together, our study provides a timely, rapid, and an efficient method not only to generate A. phagocytophilum-infected ticks but also provides a tool to understand acquisition and transmission dynamics of this bacterium and perhaps other rickettsial pathogens from medically important vectors.

"Feeding of wildlife occurs in the context of research, wildlife management, tourism and in opportunistic ways. A review of examples shows that although feeding is often motivated by good intentions, it can lead to problems of public safety and conservation and be detrimental to the welfare of the animals. Examples from British Columbia illustrate the problems (nuisance animal activity, public safety risk) and consequences (culling, translocation) that often arise from uncontrolled feeding. Three features of wildlife feeding can be distinguished: the feasibility of control, the effects on conservation and the effects on animal welfare. An evaluative framework incorporating these three features was applied to examples of feeding from the literature. The cases of feeding for research and management purposes were generally found to be acceptable, while cases of feeding for tourism or opportunistic feeding were generally unacceptable. The framework should allow managers and policy-makers to distinguish acceptable from unacceptable forms of wildlife feeding as a basis for policy, public education and enforcement. Many harmful forms of wildlife feeding seem unlikely to change until they come to be seen as socially unacceptable.

"Wild small mammals and ticks play an important role in maintaining and spreading zoonoses in nature, as well as in captive animals. The aim of this study was to monitor selected agents with zoonotic potential in their reservoirs and vectors in a zoo, and to draw attention to the risk of possible contact with these pathogens. In total, 117 wild small mammals (rodents) and 166 ticks were collected in the area of Brno Zoo. Antibodies to the bacteria Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, and Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. were detected by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 19% (19/99), 4% (4/99), and 15% (15/99) of rodents, respectively. Antibodies to Leptospira spp. bacteria were detected by the microscopic agglutination test in 6% (4/63) of rodents. Coinfection (antibodies to more than two agents) were proved in 14.5% (15/97) of animals. The prevalence of C. burnetii statistically differed according to the years of trapping (p = 0.0241). The DNAs of B. burgdorferi s.l., Rickettsia sp., and Anaplasma phagocytophilum were detected by PCR in 16%, 6%, and 1% of ticks, respectively, without coinfection and without effect of life stage and sex of ticks on positivity. Sequencing showed homology with R. helvetica and A. phagocytophilum in four and one positive samples, respectively. The results of our study show that wild small mammals and ticks in a zoo could serve as reservoirs and vectors of infectious agents with zoonotic potential and thus present a risk of infection to zoo animals and also to keepers and visitors to a zoo.

"This review describes woodchucks chronically infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) as an animal model for hepatocarcinogenesis and treatment of primary liver cancer or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) induced by the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Since laboratory animal models susceptible to HBV infection are limited, woodchucks experimentally infected with WHV, a hepatitis virus closely related to HBV, are increasingly used to enhance our understanding of virus-host interactions, immune response, and liver disease progression. A correlation of severe liver pathogenesis with high-level viral replication and deficient antiviral immunity has been established, which are present during chronic infection after WHV inoculation of neonatal woodchucks for modeling vertical HBV transmission in humans. HCC in chronic carrier woodchucks develops 17 to 36 mo after neonatal WHV infection and involves liver tumors that are comparable in size, morphology, and molecular gene signature to those of HBV-infected patients. Accordingly, woodchucks with WHV-induced liver tumors have been used for the improvement of imaging and ablation techniques of human HCC. In addition, drug efficacy studies in woodchucks with chronic WHV infection have revealed that prolonged treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogs, alone or in combination with other compounds, minimizes the risk of liver disease progression to HCC. More recently, woodchucks have been utilized in the delineation of mechanisms involved in innate and adaptive immune responses against WHV during acute, self-limited and chronic infections. Therapeutic interventions based on modulating the deficient host antiviral immunity have been explored in woodchucks for inducing functional cure in HBV-infected patients and for reducing or even delaying associated liver disease sequelae, including the onset of HCC. Therefore, woodchucks with chronic WHV infection constitute a well-characterized, fully immunocompetent animal model for HBV-induced liver cancer and for preclinical evaluation of the safety and efficacy of new modalities, which are based on chemo, gene, and immune therapy, for the prevention and treatment of HCC in patients for which current treatment options are dismal.

"The timing of seedling emergence is strongly linked with fitness because it determines the biotic and abiotic environment experienced by plants in this vulnerable life stage. Experiments and observations consistently find that earlier-emerging plants have a competitive advantage over those emerging later. However, substantial genetic and phenotypic variation in emergence timing is harbored within and among plant populations, making it important to characterize the selective agents-including biotic interactions-that contribute to this variation. In seasonal herbaceous communities, we hypothesized that consumption of early-emerging individuals by vertebrates could weaken the strength of directional selection for earlier emergence in competitive environments. To investigate this, we carried out phenotypic selection analyses on emergence timing in two California grass species, the native Stipa pulchra and non-native Bromus diandrus, growing in intraspecific competitive neighborhoods with and without vertebrate herbivore exclusion. Vertebrate herbivores consistently weakened directional selection for earlier emergence. Our results demonstrate that vertebrate herbivores play an underappreciated selective role on phenology in plant populations, with implications for contemporary evolution, such as the potential of species to adapt to global environmental changes.

"The widespread use of pesticides to control agricultural pests is a hot topic on the public scene of environmental health. Selective pest control for minimum environmental impact is a major goal of the environmental toxicology field, notably to avoid unintended poisoning in different organisms. Anticoagulant rodenticides cause abnormal blood coagulation process; they have been widely used to control rodents, allowing inadvertent primary and secondary exposure in domestic animals and non-target predatory wildlife species through direct ingestion of rodenticide-containing bait or by consumption of poisoned prey. To report toxic effect, the most common approach is the measurement of liver or plasma residues of anticoagulant rodenticides in dead or intoxicated animals showing clinical symptoms. However, one major challenge is that literature currently lacks a hepatic or plasma concentration threshold value for the differentiation of exposure from toxicity. Regarding the variation in pharmacology properties of anticoagulant rodenticides inter- and intra-species, the dose-response relationship must be defined for each species to prejudge the relative risk of poisoning. Beyond that, biomarkers are a key solution widely used for ecological risk assessment of contaminants. Since anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) have toxic effects at the biochemical level, biomarkers can serve as indicators of toxic exposure. In this sense, toxicological knowledge of anticoagulant rodenticides within organisms is an important tool for defining sensitive, specific, and suitable biomarkers. In this review, we provide an overview of the toxicodynamic and toxicokinetic parameters of anticoagulant rodenticides in different animal species. We examine different types of biomarkers used to characterize and differentiate the exposure and toxic effects of anticoagulant rodenticide, showing the strengths and weaknesses of the assays. Finally, we describe possible new biomarkers and highlight their capabilities.

"The parabigeminal nucleus (PBG) is the mammalian homologue to the isthmic complex of other vertebrates. Optogenetic stimulation of the PBG induces freezing and escape in mice, a result thought to be caused by a PBG projection to the central nucleus of the amygdala. However, the isthmic complex, including the PBG, has been classically considered satellite nuclei of the Superior Colliculus (SC), which upon stimulation of its medial part also triggers fear and avoidance reactions. As the PBG-SC connectivity is not well characterized, we investigated whether the topology of the PBG projection to the SC could be related to the behavioral consequences of PBG stimulation. To that end, we performed immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and neural tracer injections in the SC and PBG in a diurnal rodent, the Octodon degus. We found that all PBG neurons expressed both glutamatergic and cholinergic markers and were distributed in clearly defined anterior (aPBG) and posterior (pPBG) subdivisions. The pPBG is connected reciprocally and topographically to the ipsilateral SC, whereas the aPBG receives afferent axons from the ipsilateral SC and projected exclusively to the contralateral SC. This contralateral projection forms a dense field of terminals that is restricted to the medial SC, in correspondence with the SC representation of the aerial binocular field which, we also found, in O. degus prompted escape reactions upon looming stimulation. Therefore, this specialized topography allows binocular interactions in the SC region controlling responses to aerial predators, suggesting a link between the mechanisms by which the SC and PBG produce defensive behaviors.

"Municipal wastewater treatment plants in coastal areas are facing numerous challenges, including the need to provide a cost-effective approach for removing nutrients and trace organic contaminants from wastewater, as well as adapting to the effects of climate change. The horizontal levee is a multi-benefit response to these issues that consists of a sloped subsurface treatment wetland built between a coastal levee and tidal marshes. The wetland attenuates storm surges and can provide space for wetland transgression to higher elevations as sea levels rise, while simultaneously removing contaminants from treated wastewater effluent. To assess the ability of the horizontal levee to improve water quality and to identify optimal operating conditions, a 0.7-ha experimental system was studied over a two-year period. The removal of nitrate and trace organic contaminants was particularly sensitive to hydrology; rapid and near complete removal (>97%) of these contaminants was observed in water flowing through the subsurface, whereas surface flows did not exhibit measurable contaminant removal. Removal of F+ coliphage also appeared to be sensitive to hydrology, with up to 99% removal of these indicator viruses in subsurface flow. For phosphate, removal was not as sensitive to hydrology, but significant removal (>83%) was still observed when overland flow was eliminated. Although removal of contaminants did not appear to be sensitive to other design considerations, parameters such as soil texture and planting regimes affected the maximum subsurface flows, which in turn controlled contaminant mass loadings. Rapid subsurface removal of contaminants suggests that water quality benefits of these systems are limited by physical constraints (i.e., the ability of the system to maintain subsurface flow) and not chemical or biological conditions in the subsurface.

"Current evidence supports the view that the visual pulvinar of primates consists of at least five nuclei, with two large nuclei, lateral pulvinar ventrolateral (PLvl) and central lateral nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (PIcl), contributing mainly to the ventral stream of cortical processing for perception, and three smaller nuclei, posterior nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (PIp), medial nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (PIm), and central medial nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (PIcm), projecting to dorsal stream visual areas for visually directed actions. In primates, both cortical streams are highly dependent on visual information distributed from primary visual cortex (V1). This area is so vital to vision that patients with V1 lesions are considered ""cortically blind"". When the V1 inputs to dorsal stream area middle temporal visual area (MT) are absent, other dorsal stream areas receive visual information relayed from the superior colliculus via PIp and PIcm, thereby preserving some dorsal stream functions, a phenomenon called ""blind sight"". Non-primate mammals do not have a dorsal stream area MT with V1 inputs, but superior colliculus inputs to temporal cortex can be more significant and more visual functions are preserved when V1 input is disrupted. The current review will discuss how the different visual streams, especially the dorsal stream, have changed during primate evolution and we propose which features are retained from the common ancestor of primates and their close relatives.

"Manipulation experiments are a cornerstone of ecological research, but can be logistically challenging to execute-particularly when they are intended to isolate the ecological role of large, vagile species, like birds. Despite indirect evidence that birds are influential in many ecosystems, large-scale, multi-year bird manipulation experiments are rare. When these studies are conducted, they are typically realized with caged or netted exclosures, an approach that can be expensive, risky for wildlife, and difficult to maintain. In cases where caged exclosures are not appropriate, alternate approaches are needed to allow rigorous empirical studies on the ecological role of birds. Here, we present and validate a method for experimentally increasing the abundance and richness of birds at the scale of entire aquatic ecosystems. Unlike bird exclusion, this approach is experimentally tractable, appealing to land managers, and possible to deploy over large spatial scales. We tested the efficacy of our approach for increasing bird abundance and species richness at 16 central California ponds. Based on bird visitation data obtained by summer camera trapping, our approach significantly increased bird species richness and abundance at manipulated ponds compared to control ponds. Attractant treatments mitigated the negative effects of a major drought on bird species richness and generated a near doubling of bird abundance in the presence of attractants. Treatments had no effect on most mammal species, with the exception of ground squirrels, which increased in abundance in the presence of attractants. These results suggest that attractants are effective in increasing bird abundance and richness. We encourage researchers to consider this approach for experimentally isolating the ecological role of birds in aquatic and open terrestrial ecosystems, especially in cases where cost or logistical constraints preclude the use of caged or netted exclosures.

"Hepatoma is one of the most severe malignancies usually with poor prognosis, and many patients are insensitive to the existing therapeutic agents, including the drugs for chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy. Currently, researchers are committed to developing the advanced formulations with controlled drug delivery to improve the efficacy of hepatoma therapy. Numerous inoculated, induced, and genetically engineered hepatoma rodent models are now available for formulation screening. However, animal models of hepatoma cannot accurately represent human hepatoma in terms of histological characteristics, metastatic pathways, and post-treatment responses. Therefore, advanced animal hepatoma models with comparable pathogenesis and pathological features are in urgent need in the further studies. Moreover, the development of nanomedicines has renewed hope for chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapy of advanced hepatoma. As one kind of advanced formulations, the polymer-based nanoformulated drugs have many advantages over the traditional ones, such as improved tumor selectivity and treatment efficacy, and reduced systemic side effects. In this article, the construction of rodent hepatoma model and much information about the current development of polymer nanomedicines were reviewed in order to provide a basis for the development of advanced formulations with clinical therapeutic potential for hepatoma.

"To combat retinal degeneration, healthy fetal retinal sheets have been successfully transplanted into both rodent models and humans, with synaptic connectivity between transplant and degenerated host retina having been confirmed. In rodent studies, transplants have been shown to restore responses to flashes of light in a region of the superior colliculus corresponding to the location of the transplant in the host retina. To determine the quality and detail of visual information provided by the transplant, visual responsivity was studied here at the level of visual cortex where higher visual perception is processed. For our model, we used the transgenic Rho-S334ter line-3 rat (both sexes), which loses photoreceptors at an early age and is effectively blind at postnatal day 30. These rats received fetal retinal sheet transplants in one eye between 24 and 40 d of age. Three to 10 months following surgery, visually responsive neurons were found in regions of primary visual cortex matching the transplanted region of the retina that were as highly selective as normal rat to stimulus orientation, size, contrast, and spatial and temporal frequencies. Conversely, we found that selective response properties were largely absent in nontransplanted line-3 rats. Our data show that fetal retinal sheet transplants can result in remarkably normal visual function in visual cortex of rats with a degenerated host retina and represents a critical step toward developing an effective remedy for the visually impaired human population.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Age-related macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa lead to profound vision loss in millions of people worldwide. Many patients lose both retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. Hence, there is a great demand for the development of efficient techniques that allow for long-term vision restoration. In this study, we transplanted dissected fetal retinal sheets, which can differentiate into photoreceptors and integrate with the host retina of rats with severe retinal degeneration. Remarkably, we show that transplants generated visual responses in cortex similar in quality to normal rats. Furthermore, transplants preserved connectivity within visual cortex and the retinal relay from the lateral geniculate nucleus to visual cortex, supporting their potential application in curing vision loss associated with retinal degeneration.

"Bartonellosis is a vector-borne zoonotic disease with worldwide distribution that can infect humans and a large number of mammals including small companion animals (cats and dogs). In recent years, an increasing number of studies from around the world have reported Bartonella infections, although publications have predominantly focused on the North American perspective. Currently, clinico-pathological data from Europe are more limited, suggesting that bartonellosis may be an infrequent or underdiagnosed infectious disease in cats and dogs. Research is needed to confirm or exclude Bartonella infection as a cause of a spectrum of feline and canine diseases. Bartonella spp. can cause acute or chronic infections in cats, dogs and humans. On a comparative medical basis, different clinical manifestations, such as periods of intermittent fever, granulomatous inflammation involving the heart, liver, lymph nodes and other tissues, endocarditis, bacillary angiomatosis, peliosis hepatis, uveitis and vasoproliferative tumors have been reported in cats, dogs and humans. The purpose of this review is to provide an update and European perspective on Bartonella infections in cats and dogs, including clinical, diagnostic, epidemiological, pathological, treatment and zoonotic aspects.

"Transovarial transmission (TOT) is a widespread and efficient process through which pathogens can be passed between generations of arthropod vectors. Many species within the order Bunyavirales utilize TOT as a means of persisting within the environment when classical horizontal transmission is not possible due to ecological constraints. The purpose of this review is to summarize previous findings regarding the ecological significance of TOT among viruses in the order Bunyavirales and identify the gaps in knowledge regarding this important mechanism of arboviral maintenance.

"Animals in the non-tropical zone usually demonstrate seasonal variations in immune function, which is important for their survival. In the present study, seasonal changes in immunity in striped hamsters (Cricetulus barabensis) were investigated to test the winter immunoenhancement hypothesis. Male hamsters were captured from the wild in the fall and winter of 2014 and in the spring and summer of 2015. Body mass, body fat mass and blood glucose levels of the hamsters were all highest in the summer, whereas relative fatness and thymus mass had no seasonal changes. Spleen mass was highest in the fall and white blood cells and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) response indicative of cellular immunity were lowest in the summer among the four seasons, which supports the winter immunoenhancement hypothesis. IgG and IgM titers were lowest in the fall, which was against this hypothesis. Body fat mass had no correlations with cellular and humoral immunity, suggesting it was not the reason for seasonal changes in cellular and humoral immunity in males. Leptin titers were higher in spring and summer than in fall and winter. No correlation between leptin and cellular and humoral immunity suggested that leptin did not mediate their seasonal changes. Similarly, corticosterone levels were also higher in spring and summer than in fall and winter, which correlated negatively with cellular immunity but positively with IgG levels. This result implied that corticosterone has a suppressive effect on cellular immunity and an enhancing effect on humoral immunity. In summary, distinct components of immune systems exhibited different seasonal patterns. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.

"In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) are the main components of the circadian timing system. The SCN, classically known as the master circadian clock, generates rhythms and synchronizes them to environmental cues. The IGL is a key structure that modulates SCN activity. Strategies on the use of time by animals can provide important clues about how some species are adapted to competitive process in nature. Few studies have provided information about temporal niche in bats with special attention on the neural substrate underlies circadian rhythms. The aim of this study was to investigate these circadian centers with respect to their cytoarchitecture, chemical content and retinal projections in the flat-faced fruit-eating bat (Artibeus planirostris), a chiropteran endemic to South America. Unlike other species of phyllostomid bats, the flat-faced fruit-eating bat's peak of activity occurs 5 h after sunset. This raises several questions about the structure and function of the SCN and IGL in this species. We carried out a mapping of the retinal projections and cytoarchitectural study of the nuclei using qualitative and quantitative approaches. Based on relative optical density findings, the SCN and IGL of the flat-faced fruit-eating bat receive bilaterally symmetric retinal innervation. The SCN contains vasopressin (VP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) neurons with neuropeptide Y (NPY), serotonin (5-HT) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) immunopositive fibers/terminals and is marked by intense glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity. The IGL contains NPY perikarya as well as GAD and 5-HT immunopositive terminals and is characterized by dense GFAP immunostaining. In addition, stereological tools were combined with Nissl stained sections to estimate the volumes of the circadian centers. Taken together, the present results in the flat-faced fruit-eating bat reveal some differences compared to other bat species which might explain the divergence in the hourly activity among bats in order to reduce the competitive potential and resource partitioning in nature.

"Rivers are a means of rapid and long-distance transmission of pathogenic microorganisms from upstream terrestrial sources. Pathogens enter streams and rivers via overland flow, shallow groundwater discharge, and direct inputs. Of concern is the protozoal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which can remain infective for weeks to months under cool and moist conditions, with the infectious stage (oocysts) largely resistant to chlorination. We applied a mobile-immobile model framework to assess Cryptosporidium transport and retention in streams, that also accounts for inactivation. The model is applied to California's Central Valley where Cryptosporidium exposure can be at higher risk due to agricultural and wildlife nonpoint sources. The results demonstrate that hyporheic exchange is an important process to include in models characterizing pathogen dynamics in streams, delaying downstream transmission and allowing for immobilization processes, such as reversible filtration in the sediments, to occur. Although in-stream concentrations decrease relatively quickly (within hours), pathogen accumulation of up to 66% of the inputs due to immobilization processes in the sediments and slower moving surface water could result in long retention times (months to years). The model appropriately estimates baseflow pathogen accumulation and can help predict the potential loads of resuspended pathogens in response to a storm event.

"Degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells can arise from environmental and/or genetic causes. Since photoreceptor cells, the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), neurons, and glial cells of the retina are intimately associated, all cell types eventually are affected by retinal degenerative diseases. Such diseases often originate either in rod and/or cone photoreceptor cells or the RPE. Of these, cone cells located in the central retina are especially important for daily human activity. Here we describe the protection of cone cells by a combination therapy consisting of the G protein-coupled receptor modulators metoprolol, tamsulosin, and bromocriptine. These drugs were tested in Abca4(-/-)Rdh8(-/-) mice, a preclinical model for retinal degeneration. The specificity of these drugs was determined with an essentially complete panel of human G protein-coupled receptors. Significantly, the combination of metoprolol, tamsulosin, and bromocriptine had no deleterious effects on electroretinographic responses of wild-type mice. Moreover, putative G protein-coupled receptor targets of these drugs were shown to be expressed in human and mouse eyes by RNA sequencing and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Liquid chromatography together with mass spectrometry using validated internal standards confirmed that metoprolol, tamsulosin, and bromocriptine individually or together penetrate the eye after either intraperitoneal delivery or oral gavage. Collectively, these findings support human trials with combined therapy composed of lower doses of metoprolol, tamsulosin, and bromocriptine designed to safely impede retinal degeneration associated with certain genetic diseases (e.g., Stargardt disease). The same low-dose combination also could protect the retina against diseases with complex or unknown etiologies such as age-related macular degeneration.

"A withstanding question in neuroscience is how neural circuits encode representations and perceptions of the external world. A particularly well-defined visual computation is the representation of global object motion by pattern direction-selective (PDS) cells from convergence of motion of local components represented by component direction-selective (CDS) cells. However, how PDS and CDS cells develop their distinct response properties is still unresolved. The visual cortex of the mouse is an attractive model for experimentally solving this issue due to the large molecular and genetic toolbox available. Although mouse visual cortex lacks the highly ordered orientation columns of primates, it is organized in functional sub-networks and contains striate- and extrastriate areas like its primate counterparts. In this Perspective article, we provide an overview of the experimental and theoretical literature on global motion processing based on works in primates and mice. Lastly, we propose what types of experiments could illuminate what circuit mechanisms are governing cortical global visual motion processing. We propose that PDS cells in mouse visual cortex appear as the perfect arena for delineating and solving how individual sensory features extracted by neural circuits in peripheral brain areas are integrated to build our rich cohesive sensory experiences.

"The activity of neuronal circuits of the neocortex underlies our ability to perceive the world and interact with our environment. During development, these circuits emerge from dynamic interactions between cell-intrinsic, genetically determined programs and input/activity-dependent signals, which together shape these circuits into adulthood. Building on a large body of experimental work, several recent technological developments now allow us to interrogate these nature–nurture interactions with single gene/single input/single-cell resolution. Focusing on excitatory glutamatergic neurons, this review discusses the genetic and input-dependent mechanisms controlling how individual cortical neurons differentiate into specialized cells to assemble into stereotypical local circuits within global, large-scale networks.

"Approximately 20% of human cancers is attributable to DNA oncogenic viruses such as human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Unrepaired DNA damage is the most common and overlapping feature of these DNA oncogenic viruses and a source of genomic instability and tumour development. Sustained DNA damage results from unceasing production of reactive oxygen species and activation of inflammasome cascades that trigger genomic changes and increased propensity of epigenetic alterations. Accumulation of epigenetic alterations may interfere with genome-wide cellular signalling machineries and promote malignant transformation leading to cancer development. Untangling and understanding the underlying mechanisms that promote these detrimental effects remain the major objectives for ongoing research and hope for effective virus-induced cancer therapy. Here, we review current literature with an emphasis on how DNA damage influences HPV, HVB, and EBV replication and epigenetic alterations that are associated with carcinogenesis.

"Bartonella infections were investigated in seven species of bats from four regions of the Republic of Georgia. Of the 236 bats that were captured, 212 (90%) specimens were tested for Bartonella infection. Colonies identified as Bartonella were isolated from 105 (49.5%) of 212 bats Phylogenetic analysis based on sequence variation of the gltA gene differentiated 22 unique Bartonella genogroups. Genetic distances between these diverse genogroups were at the level of those observed between different Bartonella species described previously. Twenty-one reference strains from 19 representative genogroups were characterized using four additional genetic markers. Host specificity to bat genera or families was reported for several Bartonella genogroups. Some Bartonella genotypes found in bats clustered with those identified in dogs from Thailand and humans from Poland.

"BACKGROUND: The geographic scale and degree of genetic differentiation for arthropod vectors that transmit parasites play an important role in the distribution, prevalence and coevolution of pathogens of human and wildlife significance. We determined the genetic diversity and population structure of the sand fly Lutzomyia vexator over spatial scales from 0.56 to 3.79 km at a study region in northern California. The study was provoked by observations of differentiation at fine spatial scales of a lizard malaria parasite vectored by Lu. vexator. METHODS: A microsatellite enrichment/next-generation sequencing protocol was used to identify variable microsatellite loci within the genome of Lu. vexator. Alleles present at these loci were examined in four populations of Lu. vexator in Hopland, CA. Population differentiation was assessed using Fst and D (of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards), and the program Structure was used to determine the degree of subdivision present. The effective population size for the sand fly populations was also calculated. RESULTS: Eight microsatellite markers were characterized and revealed high genetic diversity (uHe = 0.79-0.92, Na = 12-24) and slight but significant differentiation across the fine spatial scale examined (average pairwise D = 0.327; F (ST)  = 0.0185 (95 % bootstrapped CI: 0.0102-0.0264). Even though the insects are difficult to capture using standard methods, the estimated population size was thousands per local site. CONCLUSIONS: The results argue that Lu. vexator at the study sites are abundant and not highly mobile, which may influence the overall transmission dynamics of the lizard malaria parasite, Plasmodium mexicanum, and other parasites transmitted by this species.

"Studies of chromosome and genome biology often focus on condensed chromatin in the form of chromosomes and neglect the non-dividing cells. Even when interphase nuclei are considered, they are often then treated as interchangeable round objects. However, different cell types can have very different nuclear shapes, and these shapes have impacts on cellular function; indeed, many pathologies are linked with alterations to nuclear shape. In this review, we describe some of the nuclear morphologies beyond the spherical and ovoid. Many of the leukocytes of the immune system have lobed nuclei, which aid their flexibility and migration; smooth muscle cells have a spindle shaped nucleus, which must deform during muscle contractions; spermatozoa have highly condensed nuclei which adopt varied shapes, potentially associated with swimming efficiency. Nuclei are not passive passengers within the cell. There are clear effects of nuclear shape on the transcriptional activity of the cell. Recent work has shown that regulation of gene expression can be influenced by nuclear morphology, and that cells can drastically remodel their chromatin during differentiation. The link between the nucleoskeleton and the cytoskeleton at the nuclear envelope provides a mechanism for transmission of mechanical forces into the nucleus, directly affecting chromatin compaction and organisation.

"The term biological warfare typically conjures images of medieval warriors tossing dead cattle over city walls or clandestine government agents secretly releasing mysterious microbes into enemy territory. Of course, biological warfare does encompass such activity, but the vast majority of what constitutes biological warfare is far more mundane. Ever since life evolved on earth about 3.8 billion years ago, organisms have constantly devised new ways to kill each other. Any organism that makes use of toxins—from bacteria to snakes—is engaging in a form of biological warfare. Humans who engage in biological warfare do so by taking advantage of these toxin-producing organisms.

"Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic and pneumonic plague, is typically a zoonotic vector-borne disease of wild rodents. Bacterial biofilm formation in the proventriculus of the flea contributes to chronic infection of fleas and facilitates efficient disease transmission. However prior to biofilm formation, ingested bacteria must survive within the flea midgut, and yet little is known about vector-pathogen interactions that are required for flea gut colonization. Here we establish a Drosophila melanogaster model system to gain insight into Y. pestis colonization of the insect vector. We show that Y. pestis establishes a stable infection in the anterior midgut of fly larvae, and we used this model system to study the roles of genes involved in biofilm production and/or resistance to gut immunity stressors. We find that PhoP and GmhA both contribute to colonization and resistance to antimicrobial peptides in flies, and furthermore, the data suggest biofilm formation may afford protection against antimicrobial peptides. Production of reactive oxygen species in the fly gut, as in fleas, also serves to limit bacterial infection, and OxyR mediates Y. pestis survival in both insect models. Overall, our data establish the fruit fly as an informative model to elucidate the relationship between Y. pestis and its flea vector.

"Psychogenic fever is a stress-related, psychosomatic disease especially seen in young women. Some patients develop extremely high core body temperature (Tc) (up to 41°C) when they are exposed to emotional events, whereas others show persistent low-grade high Tc (37-38°C) during situations of chronic stress. The mechanism for psychogenic fever is not yet fully understood. However, clinical case reports demonstrate that psychogenic fever is not attenuated by antipyretic drugs, but by psychotropic drugs that display anxiolytic and sedative properties, or by resolving patients' difficulties via natural means or psychotherapy. Animal studies have demonstrated that psychological stress increases Tc via mechanisms distinct from infectious fever (which requires proinflammatory mediators) and that the sympathetic nervous system, particularly β3-adrenoceptor-mediated non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, plays an important role in the development of psychological stress-induced hyperthermia. Acute psychological stress induces a transient, monophasic increase in Tc. In contrast, repeated stress induces anticipatory hyperthermia, reduces diurnal changes in Tc, or slightly increases Tc throughout the day. Chronically stressed animals also display an enhanced hyperthermic response to a novel stress, while past fearful experiences induce conditioned hyperthermia to the fear context. The high Tc that psychogenic fever patients develop may be a complex of these diverse kinds of hyperthermic responses.

"The current experiments build upon previous studies designed to reveal the network of parietal cortical areas present in the common mammalian ancestor. Understanding this ancestral network is essential for highlighting the basic somatosensory circuitry present in all mammals, and how this basic plan was modified to generate species specific behaviors. Our animal model, the short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis domestica), is a South American marsupial that has been proposed to have a similar ecological niche and morphology to the earliest common mammalian ancestor. In this investigation, we injected retrograde neuroanatomical tracers into the face and body representations of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the rostral and caudal somatosensory fields (SR and SC), as well as a multimodal region (MM). Projections from different architectonically defined thalamic nuclei were then quantified. Our results provide further evidence to support the hypothesized basic mammalian plan of thalamic projections to S1, with the lateral and medial ventral posterior thalamic nuclei (VPl and VPm) projecting to S1 body and S1 face, respectively. Additional strong projections are from the medial division of posterior nucleus (Pom). SR receives projections from several midline nuclei, including the medial dorsal, ventral medial nucleus, and Pom. SC and MM show similar patterns of connectivity, with projections from the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei, VPm and VPl, and the entire posterior nucleus (medial and lateral). Notably, MM is distinguished from SC by relatively dense projections from the dorsal division of the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. We discuss the finding that S1 of the short-tailed opossum has a similar pattern of projections as other marsupials and mammals, but also some distinct projections not present in other mammals. Further we provide additional support for a primitive posterior parietal cortex which receives input from multiple modalities.

"Selection is predicted to drive diversification within species and lead to local adaptation, but understanding the mechanistic details underlying this process and thus the genetic basis of adaptive evolution requires the mapping of genotype to phenotype. Venom is complex and involves many genes, but the specialization of the venom gland toward toxin production allows specific transcripts to be correlated with specific toxic proteins, establishing a direct link from genotype to phenotype. To determine the extent of expression variation and identify the processes driving patterns of phenotypic diversity, we constructed genotype-phenotype maps and compared range-wide toxin-protein expression variation for two species of snake with nearly identical ranges: the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) and the eastern coral snake (Micrurus fulvius). We detected significant expression variation in C. adamanteus, identified the specific loci associated with population differentiation, and found that loci expressed at all levels contributed to this divergence. Contrary to expectations, we found no expression variation in M. fulvius, suggesting that M. fulvius populations are not locally adapted. Our results not only linked expression variation at specific loci to divergence in a polygenic, complex trait but also have extensive conservation and biomedical implications. C. adamanteus is currently a candidate for federal listing under the Endangered Species Act, and the loss of any major population would result in the irrevocable loss of a unique venom phenotype. The lack of variation in M. fulvius has significant biomedical application because our data will assist in the development of effective antivenom for this species.

"The integration of the visual stimulus takes place at the level of the neocortex, organized in anatomically distinct and functionally unique areas. Primates, including humans, are heavily dependent on vision, with approximately 50% of their neocortical surface dedicated to visual processing and possess many more visual areas than any other mammal, making them the model of choice to study visual cortical arealisation. However, in order to identify the mechanisms responsible for patterning the developing neocortex, specifying area identity as well as elucidate events that have enabled the evolution of the complex primate visual cortex, it is essential to gain access to the cortical maps of alternative species. To this end, species including the mouse have driven the identification of cellular markers, which possess an area-specific expression profile, the development of new tools to label connections and technological advance in imaging techniques enabling monitoring of cortical activity in a behaving animal. In this review we present non-primate species that have contributed to elucidating the evolution and development of the visual cortex. We describe the current understanding of the mechanisms supporting the establishment of areal borders during development, mainly gained in the mouse thanks to the availability of genetically modified lines but also the limitations of the mouse model and the need for alternate species.

"Plague, a zoonosis caused by Yersinia pestis, is still found in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Madagascar reports almost one third of the cases worldwide. Y. pestis can be encountered in three very different types of foci: urban, rural, and sylvatic. Flea vector and wild rodent host population dynamics are tightly correlated with modulation of climatic conditions, an association that could be crucial for both the maintenance of foci and human plague epidemics. The black rat Rattus rattus, the main host of Y. pestis in Madagascar, is found to exhibit high resistance to plague in endemic areas, opposing the concept of high mortality rates among rats exposed to the infection. Also, endemic fleas could play an essential role in maintenance of the foci. This review discusses recent advances in the understanding of the role of these factors as well as human behavior in the persistence of plague in Madagascar.

"Since an epizootic and detection of clinical cases of tularemia (Francisella tularensis) in 1996 at the Oregon National Primate Research Center, only 8 cases were identified in the succeeding 13 y. However, within a period of 7 mo, primarily during Winter 2010, 6 rhesus macaques were confirmed positive for Francisella tularensis type B by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by culture and fluorescent antibody testing. All cases had similar gross pathologic findings, which included necrotizing splenitis and lymphadenitis. Recent colony management efforts have focused on minimizing nonhuman primate exposure to commonly observed reservoir species and controlling rodent access to corral-style housing. Strategies continue to evolve with regard to managing a large breeding colony of nonhuman primates in the presence of this threat.

"BACKGROUND: Snake venoms have significant impacts on human populations through the morbidity and mortality associated with snakebites and as sources of drugs, drug leads, and physiological research tools. Genes expressed by venom-gland tissue, including those encoding toxic proteins, have therefore been sequenced but only with relatively sparse coverage resulting from the low-throughput sequencing approaches available. High-throughput approaches based on 454 pyrosequencing have recently been applied to the study of snake venoms to give the most complete characterizations to date of the genes expressed in active venom glands, but such approaches are costly and still provide a far-from-complete characterization of the genes expressed during venom production. RESULTS: We describe the de novo assembly and analysis of the venom-gland transcriptome of an eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus) based on 95,643,958 pairs of quality-filtered, 100-base-pair Illumina reads. We identified 123 unique, full-length toxin-coding sequences, which cluster into 78 groups with less than 1% nucleotide divergence, and 2,879 unique, full-length nontoxin coding sequences. The toxin sequences accounted for 35.4% of the total reads, and the nontoxin sequences for an additional 27.5%. The most highly expressed toxin was a small myotoxin related to crotamine, which accounted for 5.9% of the total reads. Snake-venom metalloproteinases accounted for the highest percentage of reads mapping to a toxin class (24.4%), followed by C-type lectins (22.2%) and serine proteinases (20.0%). The most diverse toxin classes were the C-type lectins (21 clusters), the snake-venom metalloproteinases (16 clusters), and the serine proteinases (14 clusters). The high-abundance nontoxin transcripts were predominantly those involved in protein folding and translation, consistent with the protein-secretory function of the tissue. CONCLUSIONS: We have provided the most complete characterization of the genes expressed in an active snake venom gland to date, producing insights into snakebite pathology and guidance for snakebite treatment for the largest rattlesnake species and arguably the most dangerous snake native to the United States of America, C. adamanteus. We have more than doubled the number of sequenced toxins for this species and created extensive genomic resources for snakes based entirely on de novo assembly of Illumina sequence data.

"The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), site of the primary clock in the circadian rhythm system, has three major afferent connections. The most important consists of a retinohypothalamic projection through which photic information, received by classical rod/cone photoreceptors and intrinsically photoreceptive retinal ganglion cells, gains access to the clock. This information influences phase and period of circadian rhythms. The two other robust afferent projections are the median raphe serotonergic pathway and the geniculohypothalamic (GHT), NPY-containing pathway from the thalamic intergeniculate leaflet (IGL). Beyond this simple framework, the number of anatomical routes that could theoretically be involved in rhythm regulation is enormous, with the SCN projecting to 15 regions and being directly innervated by about 35. If multisynaptic afferents to the SCN are included, the number expands to approximately brain 85 areas providing input to the SCN. The IGL, a known contributor to circadian rhythm regulation, has a still greater level of complexity. This nucleus connects abundantly throughout the brain (to approximately 100 regions) by pathways that are largely bilateral and reciprocal. Few of these sites have been evaluated for their contributions to circadian rhythm regulation, although most have a theoretical possibility of doing so via the GHT. The anatomy of IGL connections suggests that one of its functions may be regulation of eye movements during sleep. Together, neural circuits of the SCN and IGL are complex and interconnected. As yet, few have been tested with respect to their involvement in rhythm regulation.

"Plague is enzootic in wildlife populations of small mammals in central and eastern Asia, Africa, South and North America, and has been recognized recently as a reemerging threat to humans. Its causative agent Yersinia pestis relies on wild rodent hosts and flea vectors for its maintenance in nature. Climate influences all three components (i.e., bacteria, vectors, and hosts) of the plague system and is a likely factor to explain some of plague's variability from small and regional to large scales. Here, we review effects of climate variables on plague hosts and vectors from individual or population scales to studies on the whole plague system at a large scale. Upscaled versions of small-scale processes are often invoked to explain plague variability in time and space at larger scales, presumably because similar scale-independent mechanisms underlie these relationships. This linearity assumption is discussed in the light of recent research that suggests some of its limitations.

"Gene duplication followed by adaptive selection is believed to be the primary driver of venom evolution. However, to date, no studies have evaluated the importance of gene duplications for venom evolution using a genomic approach. The availability of a sequenced genome and a venom gland transcriptome for the enigmatic platypus provides a unique opportunity to explore the role that gene duplication plays in venom evolution. Here, we identify gene duplication events and correlate them with expressed transcripts in an in-season venom gland. Gene duplicates (1,508) were identified. These duplicated pairs (421), including genes that have undergone multiple rounds of gene duplications, were expressed in the venom gland. The majority of these genes are involved in metabolism and protein synthesis not toxin functions. Twelve secretory genes including serine proteases, metalloproteinases, and protease inhibitors likely to produce symptoms of envenomation such as vasodilation and pain were detected. Only 16 of 107 platypus genes with high similarity to known toxins evolved through gene duplication. Platypus venom C-type natriuretic peptides and nerve growth factor do not possess lineage-specific gene duplicates. Extensive duplications, believed to increase the potency of toxic content and promote toxin diversification, were not found. This is the first study to take a genome-wide approach in order to examine the impact of gene duplication on venom evolution. Our findings support the idea that adaptive selection acts on gene duplicates to drive the independent evolution and functional diversification of similar venom genes in venomous species. However, gene duplications alone do not explain the ""venome"" of the platypus. Other mechanisms, such as alternative splicing and mutation, may be important in venom innovation.

"Plague is a vector-borne, highly virulent zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. It persists in nature through transmission between its hosts (wild rodents) and vectors (fleas). During epizootics, the disease expands and spills over to other host species such as humans living in or close to affected areas. Here, we investigate the effect of large-scale climate variability on the dynamics of human plague in the western United States using a 56-year time series of plague reports (1950-2005). We found that El Niño Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation in combination affect the dynamics of human plague over the western United States. The underlying mechanism could involve changes in precipitation and temperatures that impact both hosts and vectors. It is suggested that snow also may play a key role, possibly through its effects on summer soil moisture, which is known to be instrumental for flea survival and development and sustained growth of vegetation for rodents.

"BACKGROUND: Human cases of plague (Yersinia pestis) infection originate, ultimately, in the bacterium's wildlife host populations. The epidemiological dynamics of the wildlife reservoir therefore determine the abundance, distribution and evolution of the pathogen, which in turn shape the frequency, distribution and virulence of human cases. Earlier studies have shown clear evidence of climatic forcing on contemporary plague abundance in rodents and humans. RESULTS: We find that high-resolution palaeoclimatic indices correlate with plague prevalence and population density in a major plague host species, the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus), over 1949-1995. Climate-driven models trained on these data predict independent data on human plague cases in early 20th-century Kazakhstan from 1904-1948, suggesting a consistent impact of climate on large-scale wildlife reservoir dynamics influencing human epidemics. Extending the models further back in time, we also find correspondence between their predictions and qualitative records of plague epidemics over the past 1500 years. CONCLUSIONS: Central Asian climate fluctuations appear to have had significant influences on regional human plague frequency in the first part of the 20th century, and probably over the past 1500 years. This first attempt at ecoepidemiological reconstruction of historical disease activity may shed some light on how long-term plague epidemiology interacts with human activity. As plague activity in Central Asia seems to have followed climate fluctuations over the past centuries, we may expect global warming to have an impact upon future plague epidemiology, probably sustaining or increasing plague activity in the region, at least in the rodent reservoirs, in the coming decades.See commentary: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/8/108.

"A key principle of retinal organization is that distinct ON and OFF channels are relayed by separate populations of bipolar cells to different sublaminae of the inner plexiform layer (IPL). ON bipolar cell axons have been thought to synapse exclusively in the inner IPL (the ON sublamina) onto dendrites of ON-type amacrine and ganglion cells. However, M1 melanopsin-expressing ganglion cells and dopaminergic amacrine (DA) cells apparently violate this dogma. Both are driven by ON bipolar cells, but their dendrites stratify in the outermost IPL, within the OFF sublamina. Here, in the mouse retina, we show that some ON cone bipolar cells make ribbon synapses in the outermost OFF sublayer, where they costratify with and contact the dendrites of M1 and DA cells. Whole-cell recording and dye filling in retinal slices indicate that type 6 ON cone bipolars provide some of this ectopic ON channel input. Imaging studies in dissociated bipolar cells show that these ectopic ribbon synapses are capable of vesicular release. There is thus an accessory ON sublayer in the outer IPL.

"We report the second human case of infection caused by an organism identified as the proposed Bartonella species, ""B. washoensis.""

"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a member of the hepadnavirus family. Hepadnaviruses can be found in both mammals (orthohepadnaviruses) and birds (avihepadnaviruses). The genetic variability of HBV is very high. There are eight genotypes of HBV and three clades of HBV isolates from apes that appear to be additional genotypes of HBV. Most genotypes are now divided into subgenotypes with distinct virological and epidemiological properties. In addition, recombination among HBV genotypes increases the variability of HBV. This review summarises current knowledge of the epidemiology of genetic variability in hepadnaviruses and, due to rapid progress in the field, updates several recent reviews on HBV genotypes and subgenotypes.

"Among the many mammals infected with Bartonella spp., pets represent a large reservoir for human infection because most Bartonella spp. infecting them are zoonotic. Cats are the main reservoir for Bartonella henselae, B. clarridgeiae, and B. koehlerae. Dogs can be infected with B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae, B. washoensis, B. elizabethae, and B. quintana. The role of dogs as an important reservoir of Bartonella spp. is less clear than for cats because domestic dogs are more likely to be accidental hosts, at least in nontropical regions. Nevertheless, dogs are excellent sentinels for human infections because a similar disease spectrum develops in dogs. Transmission of B. henselae by cat fleas is better understood, although new potential vectors (ticks and biting flies) have been identified. We review current knowledge on the etiologic agents, clinical features, and epidemiologic characteristics of these emerging zoonoses.

"BACKGROUND: The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins are a large and complex multigene family of transcription factors with important roles in animal development, including that of fruitflies, nematodes and vertebrates. The identification of orthologous relationships among the bHLH genes from these widely divergent taxa allows reconstruction of the putative complement of bHLH genes present in the genome of their last common ancestor. RESULTS: We identified 39 different bHLH genes in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, 58 in the fly Drosophila melanogaster and 125 in human (Homo sapiens). We defined 44 orthologous families that include most of these bHLH genes. Of these, 43 include both human and fly and/or worm genes, indicating that genes from these families were already present in the last common ancestor of worm, fly and human. Only two families contain both yeast and animal genes, and no family contains both plant and animal bHLH genes. We suggest that the diversification of bHLH genes is directly linked to the acquisition of multicellularity, and that important diversification of the bHLH repertoire occurred independently in animals and plants. CONCLUSIONS: As the last common ancestor of worm, fly and human is also that of all bilaterian animals, our analysis indicates that this ancient ancestor must have possessed at least 43 different types of bHLH, highlighting its genomic complexity.

"Diseases such as plague, typhus, malaria, yellow fever, and dengue fever, transmitted between humans by blood-feeding arthropods, were once common in the United States. Many of these diseases are no longer present, mainly because of changes in land use, agricultural methods, residential patterns, human behavior, and vector control. However, diseases that may be transmitted to humans from wild birds or mammals (zoonoses) continue to circulate in nature in many parts of the country. Most vector-borne diseases exhibit a distinct seasonal pattern, which clearly suggests that they are weather sensitive. Rainfall, temperature, and other weather variables affect in many ways both the vectors and the pathogens they transmit. For example, high temperatures can increase or reduce survival rate, depending on the vector, its behavior, ecology, and many other factors. Thus, the probability of transmission may or may not be increased by higher temperatures. The tremendous growth in international travel increases the risk of importation of vector-borne diseases, some of which can be transmitted locally under suitable circumstances at the right time of the year. But demographic and sociologic factors also play a critical role in determining disease incidence, and it is unlikely that these diseases will cause major epidemics in the United States if the public health infrastructure is maintained and improved.

"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) was detected by serological testing for HBV surface antigen and by PCR assay for HBV DNA in serum samples from two common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes subsp. verus) born in West Africa. The complete genome sequences obtained by nucleotide sequencing of overlapping DNA fragments amplified by PCR were compared with HBV variants recovered from other primates and with human genotypes A to F. Both chimpanzee sequences were 3, 182 nucleotides in length, and the surface gene sequence predicted the existence of a, d, and w serological determinants. Neither sequence contained stop codons in the precore region. On phylogenetic analysis, the HBV variants infecting the chimpanzees clustered together with a third chimpanzee HBV isolate independently obtained from an infected captive animal (A. J. Zuckerman, A. Thornton, C. R. Howard, K. N. Tsiquaye, D. M. Jones, and M. R. Brambell, Lancet ii:652-654, 1978), with an overall sequence similarity of >94%. This provides strong evidence for a chimpanzee-specific genotype of HBV which circulates in nature. These findings add to the recent evidence for infection in the wild of other Old and New World primates (gibbon, orangutan, and woolly monkey) with species-specific variants of HBV. There is no evidence for close phylogenetic clustering of variants found so far in primates with any of the established HBV genotypes from humans. With the new evidence for the widespread distribution of HBV in primates, hypotheses for the origins of human infection are reviewed.

"Susceptibility studies were undertaken to determine the response of some South African wild rodent species to experimental plague (Yersinia pestis) infection. A degree of plague resistance was found in three gerbil species captured in the plague enzootic region of the northern Cape Province, these being the Namaqua gerbil, Desmodillus auricularis, (LD50 1 X 10(6) organisms), the bushveld gerbil, Tatera leucogaster, (LD50 9.1 X 10(5)) and the highveld gerbil, T. brantsii (LD50 4 X 10(2)). Animals from a population of the four-striped mouse, Rhabdomys pumilio, captured in the plague area of Port Elizabeth, proved moderately resistant to experimental plague infection (LD50 1.3 X 10(4)) while those from another population of the same species captured in a plague-free area of the Orange Free State were extremely susceptible (LD50, 5 organisms). The response of both populations however was a heterogeneous one. Marked differences in susceptibility were also found between two populations of multimammate mice, Mastomys natalensis (2n = 32) although both originated from areas outwith the known distribution of plague in southern Africa. The 50% infectious dose was relatively high in T. leucogaster (3.2 X 10(2)) and D. auricularis (1.7 X 10(3)), but was low (2-16 organisms) in the other rodent species tested. The plague antibody response, determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), was extremely short-lived in T. leucogaster, only 10% of inoculated animals remaining seropositive at low titres after 11 weeks. Antibodies persisted for only slightly longer in the sera of T. brantsii which were reinoculated with 2 X 10(3) plague organisms 6 weeks after initial challenge. The demonstration of the existence of both susceptible and resistant populations of R. pumilio and M. natalensis indicates that these species must be considered as potential plague reservoir hosts in parts of South Africa. The results suggest that resistance to plague infection in previously epizootic hosts in the northern Cape Province such as Tatera sp. and D. auricularis has arisen through continual selective pressure of the organism. If the findings are applicable to gerbil populations in other plague enzootic regions of South Africa it is probable that acquired plague resistance has been responsible for the absence of gerbil epizootics and consequently for the dramatic decline in human plague outbreaks in South Africa since 1950.

"Museum specimens play an increasingly important role in predicting the outcomes and revealing the consequences of anthropogenically driven disruption of the biosphere. As ecological communities respond to ongoing environmental change, host-parasite interactions are also altered. This shifting landscape of host-parasite associations creates opportunities for colonization of different hosts and emergence of new pathogens, with implications for wildlife conservation and management, public health, and other societal concerns. Integrated archives that document and preserve mammal specimens along with their communities of associated parasites and ancillary data provide a powerful resource for investigating, anticipating, and mitigating the epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary impacts of environmental perturbation. Mammalogists who collect and archive mammal specimens have a unique opportunity to expand the scope and impact of their field work by collecting the parasites that are associated with their study organisms. We encourage mammalogists to embrace an integrated and holistic sampling paradigm and advocate for this to become standard practice for museum-based collecting. To this end, we provide a detailed, field-tested protocol to give mammalogists the tools to collect and preserve host and parasite materials that are of high quality and suitable for a range of potential downstream analyses (e.g., genetic, morphological). Finally, we also encourage increased global cooperation across taxonomic disciplines to build an integrated series of baselines and snapshots of the changing biosphere.

"The crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus Ahl, 1930) is an endangered reptile species, and in recent years many have died from diseases, especially the rescued and breeding individuals. However, pathogens underlying these diseases are unclear. In this study, we report our effort in rapidly identifying and isolating the pathogen that causes high mortality in crocodile lizards from Guangdong Luokeng Shinisaurus crocodilurus National Nature Reserve. The typical symptom is cutaneous granuloma in the infected crocodile lizards. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a comprehensive approach for sequence-based identification of pathogenic microbes. In this study, 16S rDNA based mNGS was used for rapid identification of pathogens, and microscopy and microbe isolation were used to confirm the results. Austwickia chelonae was identified to be the dominant pathogen in the granuloma using 16S rDNA based mNGS. Chinese skinks were used as an animal model to verify the pathogenicity of A. chelonae to fulfill Koch's postulates. As expected, subcutaneous inoculation of A. chelonae induced granulomas in the healthy Chinese skinks and the A. chelonae was re-isolated from the induced granulomas. Therefore, A. chelonae was the primary pathogen that caused this high mortality disease, cutaneous granuloma, in crocodile lizards from Guangdong Luokeng Shinisaurus crocodilurus National Nature Reserve. Antibiotics analysis demonstrated that A. chelonae was sensitive to cephalothin, minocycline and ampicillin, but not to kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin and clarithromycin, suggesting a possible treatment for the infected crocodile lizards. However, surgical resection of the nodules as early as possible was recommended. This study is the first report of pathogenic analysis in crocodile lizards and provides a reference for disease control and conservations of the endangered crocodile lizards and other reptiles. In addition, this study indicated that mNGS of lesions could be used to detect the pathogens in animals with benefits in speed and convenient.

"A laboratory-housed, wild-caught, subadult, male meadow jumping mouse (Zapus hudsonius) presented with extensive scaling of the face, limbs, and tail and severe edema of the paws. Postmortem examination revealed marked distal limb edema with focal digital hematomas and white scales, scabs, and crusts affecting the majority of nonhaired skin. Histopathologic analysis revealed severe, multifocal, chronic-active exudative and proliferative dermatitis characterized by multilaminated crusts covering the epidermis. The epidermis was expanded by hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and hyperplasia. The superficial dermis contained moderate edema, hemorrhage, and pigmentary incontinence, and was infiltrated by granulocytes and mononuclear cells. The laminated crusts contained numerous branching filaments of gram-positive coccoid bodies arranged in parallel rows, consistent with cutaneous Dermatophilus congolensis infection. This diagnosis was confirmed through bacterial culture and 16S rRNA PCR analysis. In the presented case, factors that might have contributed to disease progression include climatic conditions at the capture site and stress associated with trapping and laboratory housing.

"Escherichia coli strains have not been fully characterized in laboratory mice and are not currently excluded from mouse colonies. Colibactin (Clb), a cytotoxin, has been associated with inflammation and cancer in humans and animals. We performed bacterial cultures utilizing rectal swab, fecal, and extra intestinal samples from clinically unaffected or affected laboratory mice. Fifty-one E. coli were isolated from 45 laboratory mice, identified biochemically, and selected isolates were serotyped. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced for specific isolates, PCR used for clbA and clbQ gene amplification, and phylogenetic group identification was performed on all 51 E. coli strains. Clb genes were sequenced and selected E. coli isolates were characterized using a HeLa cell cytotoxicity assay. Forty-five of the 51 E. coli isolates (88%) encoded clbA and clbQ and belonged to phylogenetic group B2. Mouse E. coli serotypes included: O2:H6, O-:H-, OM:H+, and O22:H-. Clb-encoding O2: H6 mouse E. coli isolates were cytotoxic in vitro. A Clb-encoding E. coli was isolated from a clinically affected genetically modified mouse with cystic endometrial hyperplasia. Our findings suggest that Clb-encoding E. coli colonize laboratory mice and may induce clinical and subclinical diseases that may impact experimental mouse models.

"Small mammals provide ecosystem services, acting, for example, as pollinators and seed dispersers. In addition, they are also disease reservoirs that can be detrimental to human health and they can also act as crop pests. Knowledge of their dispersal preferences is therefore useful for population management and landscape planning. Genetic data were used alongside landscape data to examine the influence of the landscape on the demographic connectedness of the Natal multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis) and to identify landscape characteristics that influence the genetic structure of this species across a spatially and temporally varying environment. The most significant landscape features shaping gene flow were aspect, vegetation cover, topographic complexity (TC) and rivers, with western facing slopes, topographic complexity and rivers restricting gene flow. In general, thicket vegetation was correlated with increased gene flow. Identifying features of the landscape that facilitate movement/dispersal in M. natalensis potentially has application for other small mammals in similar ecosystems. As the primary reservoir host of the zoonotic Lassa virus, a landscape genetics approach may have applications in determining areas of high disease risk to humans. Identifying these landscape features may also be important in crop management due to damage by rodent pests.

"Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes granulocytic anaplasmosis, an emerging disease of humans and domestic animals. The obligate intracellular bacterium uses its invasins OmpA, Asp14, and AipA to infect myeloid and non-phagocytic cells. Identifying the domains of these proteins that mediate binding and entry, and determining the molecular basis of their interactions with host cell receptors would significantly advance understanding of A. phagocytophilum infection. Here, we identified the OmpA binding domain as residues 59 to 74. Polyclonal antibody generated against a peptide spanning OmpA residues 59 to 74 inhibited A. phagocytophilum infection of host cells and binding to its receptor, sialyl Lewis x (sLe(x)-capped P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1. Molecular docking analyses predicted that OmpA residues G61 and K64 interact with the two sLe(x) sugars that are important for infection, α2,3-sialic acid and α1,3-fucose. Amino acid substitution analyses demonstrated that K64 was necessary, and G61 was contributory, for recombinant OmpA to bind to host cells and competitively inhibit A. phagocytophilum infection. Adherence of OmpA to RF/6A endothelial cells, which express little to no sLe(x) but express the structurally similar glycan, 6-sulfo-sLe(x), required α2,3-sialic acid and α1,3-fucose and was antagonized by 6-sulfo-sLe(x) antibody. Binding and uptake of OmpA-coated latex beads by myeloid cells was sensitive to sialidase, fucosidase, and sLe(x) antibody. The Asp14 binding domain was also defined, as antibody specific for residues 113 to 124 inhibited infection. Because OmpA, Asp14, and AipA each contribute to the infection process, it was rationalized that the most effective blocking approach would target all three. An antibody cocktail targeting the OmpA, Asp14, and AipA binding domains neutralized A. phagocytophilum binding and infection of host cells. This study dissects OmpA-receptor interactions and demonstrates the effectiveness of binding domain-specific antibodies for blocking A. phagocytophilum infection.

"BACKGROUND: Landscape may affect the distribution of infectious diseases by influencing the population density and dispersal of hosts and vectors. Plague (Yersinia pestis infection) is a highly virulent, re-emerging disease, the ecology of which has been scarcely studied in Africa. Human seroprevalence data for the major plague focus of Madagascar suggest that plague spreads heterogeneously across the landscape as a function of the relief. Plague is primarily a disease of rodents. We therefore investigated the relationship between disease distribution and the population genetic structure of the black rat, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure (15 microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, each covering about 150-200 km(2) within the Madagascan plague focus. The seroprevalence levels in the rat populations mimicked those previously reported for humans. As expected, rat populations clearly displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differs between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not related everywhere to the effective dispersal of rats. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Genetic diversity estimates suggested that plague epizootics had only a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination cannot be accounted for solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir. Human social activities may also be involved in spreading the disease in rat and human populations.

"Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is endemic in Africa, where it causes disease in humans resembling smallpox. A recent importation of MPXV-infected animals into the United States raises the possibility of global spread. Rodents comprise the major reservoir of MPXV, and a variety of such animals, even those native to North America, are susceptible. In contrast, common inbred strains of mice, including BALB/c and C57BL/6, are greatly resistant to MPXV. However, several inbred strains of mice derived from wild mice, including CAST/EiJ, exhibit morbidity and mortality at relatively low inoculums of MPXV. Elucidating the basis for the susceptibility of CAST/EiJ mice could contribute to an understanding of MPXV pathogenicity and host defense mechanisms and enhance the value of this mouse strain as a model system for evaluation of therapeutics and vaccines. Here we compared virus dissemination and induced cytokine production in CAST/EiJ mice to those in the resistant BALB/c strain. Following intranasal infection, robust virus replication occurred in the lungs of both strains, although a relatively higher inoculum was required for BALB/c. However, while spread to other internal organs was rapid and efficient in CAST/EiJ mice, the virus was largely restricted to the lungs in BALB/c mice. Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and CCL5 were induced in lungs of BALB/c mice concomitant with virus replication but not in CAST/EiJ mice. The importance of IFN-γ in protection against MPXV disease was demonstrated by the intranasal administration of the mouse cytokine to CAST/EiJ mice and the resulting protection against MPXV. Furthermore, C57BL/6 mice with inactivation of the IFN-γ gene or the IFN-γ receptor gene exhibited enhanced sensitivity to MPXV.

"Sensory perception depends on the context in which a stimulus occurs. Prevailing models emphasize cortical feedback as the source of contextual modulation. However, higher order thalamic nuclei, such as the pulvinar, interconnect with many cortical and subcortical areas, suggesting a role for the thalamus in providing sensory and behavioral context. Yet the nature of the signals conveyed to cortex by higher order thalamus remains poorly understood. Here we use axonal calcium imaging to measure information provided to visual cortex by the pulvinar equivalent in mice, the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), as well as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). We found that dLGN conveys retinotopically precise visual signals, while LP provides distributed information from the visual scene. Both LP and dLGN projections carry locomotion signals. However, while dLGN inputs often respond to positive combinations of running and visual flow speed, LP signals discrepancies between self-generated and external visual motion. This higher order thalamic nucleus therefore conveys diverse contextual signals that inform visual cortex about visual scene changes not predicted by the animal's own actions.

"Photoreception in the mammalian retina is not restricted to rods and cones but extends to a subset of retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanopsin (mRGCs). These mRGCs are known to drive such reflex light responses as circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements. By contrast, until now there has been no direct assessment of their contribution to conventional visual pathways. Here, we address this deficit. Using new reporter lines, we show that mRGC projections are much more extensive than previously thought and extend across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. We continue to show that this input supports extensive physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex in mice lacking rods+cones (a model of advanced retinal degeneration). Moreover, using chromatic stimuli to isolate melanopsin-derived responses in mice with an intact visual system, we reveal strong melanopsin input to the ∼40% of neurons in the LGN that show sustained activation to a light step. We demonstrate that this melanopsin input supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of these neurons. The implication that melanopsin is required to accurately encode stimulus irradiance is confirmed using melanopsin knockout mice. Our data establish melanopsin-based photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods+cones. These findings identify mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and indicate that they may support vision in people suffering retinal degeneration.

"Metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) is a revolutionary approach to viral diagnostic testing that allows simultaneous detection of a broad range of viruses, detailed taxonomic assignment, and detection of mutations associated with antiviral drug resistance. To enhance sensitivity for virus detection, we previously developed ViroCap, a targeted sequence capture panel designed to enrich nucleic acid from a comprehensive set of eukaryotic viruses prior to sequencing. To demonstrate the utility of MSS with targeted sequence capture for detecting clinically important viruses and characterizing clinically important viral features, we used ViroCap to analyze clinical samples from a diagnostic virology laboratory containing a broad range of medically relevant viruses. From 26 samples, MSS with ViroCap detected all of the expected viruses and 30 additional viruses. Comparing sequencing after capture enrichment with standard MSS, we detected 13 viruses only with capture enrichment and observed a consistent increase in the number and percentage of viral sequence reads as well as the breadth and depth of coverage of the viral genomes. Compared with clinical testing, MSS enhanced taxonomic assignment for 15 viruses, and codons associated with antiviral drug resistance in influenza A virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) could be analyzed. Overall, in clinical samples, MSS with targeted sequence capture provides enhanced virus detection and information of clinical and epidemiologic relevance compared with clinical testing and MSS without targeted sequence capture.

"With a few exceptions, vaccines for viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever remain unavailable or lack well-documented efficacy. In the past decade this has not been due to a lack of the ability to develop vaccine platforms against highly pathogenic viruses, but rather the lack of will/interest to invest in platforms that have the potential to become successful vaccines. The two exceptions to this are vaccines against Dengue virus (DENV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which recently have seen significant progress in putting forward new and improved vaccines, respectively. Experimental vaccines for filoviruses and Lassa virus (LASV) do exist but are hindered by a lack of financial interest and only partially or ill-defined correlates/mechanisms of protection that could be assessed in clinical trials.

"Stimulation of either the caudal pressor area (CPA) in the most caudal ventrolateral medulla with glutamate, or the nasal mucosa with ammonia vapors, induces an increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP). In the present study, we determined if neurons in the CPA serve as a relay for the increase in MABP seen after nasal stimulation. Ammonia vapors stimulated the nasal mucosa of rats anesthetized with either urethane alone or ketamine/xylazine and urethane to induce an increase in MABP, a bradycardia, and an apnea. Bilateral injections (50 nl) of glycine (1 M) or muscimol (2 mM) were placed in the CPA and the nasal mucosa again stimulated. The increases in MABP, the bradycardia and the duration of apnea to nasal stimulation were unchanged after either injection. However, resting MABP and HR were decreased significantly after glycine injections and resting MABP and resting respiratory rate were decreased after muscimol injections. The increase in MABP seen with nasal stimulation also did not change after multiple bilateral injections (3x40 nl) of ibotenate (5 microg/microl) in the CPA, but the bradycardia was eliminated and the duration of apnea was significantly shorter. These results suggest that the increase in MABP induced by nasal stimulation is via routes that do not include neurons in the CPA.

"Pancreatic-type ribonucleases (ptRNases) comprise a class of highly conserved secretory endoribonucleases in vertebrates. The prototype of this enzyme family is ribonuclease 1 (RNase 1). Understanding the physiological roles of RNase 1 is becoming increasingly important, as engineered forms of the enzyme progress through clinical trials as chemotherapeutic agents for cancer. Here, we present an in-depth biochemical characterization of RNase 1 homologs from a broad range of mammals (human, bat, squirrel, horse, cat, mouse, and cow) and nonmammalian species (chicken, lizard, and frog). We discover that the human homolog of RNase 1 has a pH optimum for catalysis, ability to degrade double-stranded RNA, and affinity for cell-surface glycans that are distinctly higher than those of its homologs. These attributes have relevance for human health. Moreover, the functional diversification of the 10 RNase 1 homologs illuminates the regulation of extracellular RNA and other aspects of vertebrate evolution.

"Infectious disease introduced by non-native species is increasingly cited as a facilitator of native population declines, but direct evidence may be lacking due to inadequate population and disease prevalence data surrounding an outbreak. Previous indirect evidence and theoretical models support squirrelpox virus (SQPV) as being potentially involved in the decline of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) following the introduction of the non-native gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) to the United Kingdom. The red squirrel is a major UK conservation concern and understanding its continuing decline is important for any attempt to mitigate the decline. The red squirrel-gray squirrel system is also exemplary of the interplay between infectious disease (apparent competition) and direct competition in driving the replacement of a native by an invasive species. Time series data from Merseyside are presented on squirrel abundance and squirrelpox disease (SQPx) incidence, to determine the effect of the pathogen and the non-native species on the native red squirrel populations. Analysis indicates that SQPx in red squirrels has a significant negative impact on squirrel densities and their population growth rate (PGR). There is little evidence for a direct gray squirrel impact; only gray squirrel presence (but not density) proved to influence red squirrel density, but not red squirrel PGR. The dynamics of red SQPx cases are largely determined by previous red SQPx cases, although previous infection of local gray squirrels also feature, and thus, SQPV-infected gray squirrels are identified as potentially initiating outbreaks of SQPx in red squirrels. Retrospective serology indicates that approximately 8% of red squirrels exposed to SQPV may survive infection during an epidemic. This study further highlights the UK red squirrel - gray squirrel system as a classic example of a native species population decline strongly facilitated by infectious disease introduced by a non-native species. It is therefore paramount that disease prevention and control measures are integral in attempts to conserve red squirrels in the United Kingdom.

"BACKGROUND: The USDA, Wildlife Services cooperative oral rabies vaccination (ORV) program uses a live vaccinia virus-vectored (genus Orthopoxvirus) vaccine, Raboral V-RG (V-RG), to vaccinate specific wildlife species against rabies virus in several regions of the U.S. Several naturally occurring orthopoxviruses have been found in North America, including one isolated from asymptomatic raccoons (Procyon lotor). The effect of naturally occurring antibodies to orthopoxviruses on successful V-RG vaccination in raccoons is the focus of this study. RESULTS: Overall, raccoons pre-immunized (n = 10) with a recombinant raccoonpox virus vaccine (RCN-F1) responded to vaccination with V-RG with lower rabies virus neutralizing antibody (VNA) titers than those which were not pre-immunized (n = 10) and some failed to seroconvert for rabies VNA to detectable levels. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the success of some ORV campaigns may be hindered where raccoonpox virus or possibly other orthopoxvirus antibodies are common in wildlife species targeted for ORV. If these areas are identified, different vaccination strategies may be warranted.

"Wildlife diseases have important implications for wildlife and human health, the preservation of biodiversity and the resilience of ecosystems. However, understanding disease dynamics and the impacts of pathogens in wild populations is challenging because these complex systems can rarely, if ever, be observed without error. Uncertainty in disease ecology studies is commonly defined in terms of either heterogeneity in detectability (due to variation in the probability of encountering, capturing, or detecting individuals in their natural habitat) or uncertainty in disease state assignment (due to misclassification errors or incomplete information). In reality, however, uncertainty in disease ecology studies extends beyond these components of observation error and can arise from multiple varied processes, each of which can lead to bias and a lack of precision in parameter estimates. Here, we present an inventory of the sources of potential uncertainty in studies that attempt to quantify disease-relevant parameters from wild populations (e.g., prevalence, incidence, transmission rates, force of infection, risk of infection, persistence times, and disease-induced impacts). We show that uncertainty can arise via processes pertaining to aspects of the disease system, the study design, the methods used to study the system, and the state of knowledge of the system, and that uncertainties generated via one process can propagate through to others because of interactions between the numerous biological, methodological and environmental factors at play. We show that many of these sources of uncertainty may not be immediately apparent to researchers (for example, unidentified crypticity among vectors, hosts or pathogens, a mismatch between the temporal scale of sampling and disease dynamics, demographic or social misclassification), and thus have received comparatively little consideration in the literature to date. Finally, we discuss the type of bias or imprecision introduced by these varied sources of uncertainty and briefly present appropriate sampling and analytical methods to account for, or minimise, their influence on estimates of disease-relevant parameters. This review should assist researchers and practitioners to navigate the pitfalls of uncertainty in wildlife disease ecology studies.

"During 2010, 48 states and Puerto Rico reported 6,154 rabid animals and 2 human rabies cases to the CDC, representing an 8% decrease from the 6,690 rabid animals and 4 human cases reported in 2009. Hawaii and Mississippi did not report any laboratory-confirmed rabid animals during 2010. Approximately 92% of reported rabid animals were wildlife. Relative contributions by the major animal groups were as follows: 2,246 raccoons (36.5%), 1,448 skunks (23.5%), 1,430 bats (23.2%), 429 foxes (6.9%), 303 cats (4.9%), 71 cattle (1.1 %), and 69 dogs (1.1 %). Compared with 2009, number of reported rabid animals decreased across all animal types with the exception of a 1 % increase in the number of reported rabid cats. Two cases of rabies involving humans were reported from Louisiana and Wisconsin in 2010. Louisiana reported an imported human rabies case involving a 19-year-old male migrant farm worker who had a history of a vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) bite received while in Mexico. This represents the first human rabies case reported in the United States confirmed to have been caused by a vampire bat rabies virus variant. Wisconsin reported a human rabies case involving a 70-year-old male that was confirmed to have been caused by a rabies virus variant associated with tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus).

"During 2011, 49 states and Puerto Rico reported 6,031 rabid animals and 6 human rabies cases to the CDC, representing a 1.9% decrease from the 6,153 rabid animals and 2 human cases reported in 2010. Approximately 92% of reported rabid animals were wildlife. Relative contributions by the major animal groups were as follows: 1,981 raccoons (32.8%), 1,627 skunks (27.0%), 1,380 bats (22.9%), 427 foxes (7.1%), 303 cats (5.0%), 65 cattle (1.1%), and 70 dogs (1.2%). Compared with 2010, there was a substantial increase in the number of rabid skunks reported. Six cases of rabies involving humans were reported from California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and South Carolina. Three cases reported from Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York were determined to be a result of canine rabies virus variants acquired outside the United States.

"The identification of Parrot bornaviruses (PaBV) in psittacine birds with proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) has not been sufficient to explain the pathogenesis of this fatal disease, since not all infected birds develop clinical signs. Although the most accepted theory indicates that PaBV directly triggers an inflammatory response in this disease, another hypothesis suggests the disease is triggered by autoantibodies targeting neuronal gangliosides, and PDD might therefore resemble Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) in its pathogenesis. Experimental inoculation of pure gangliosides and brain-derived ganglioside extracts were used in two different immunization studies. The first study was performed on 17 healthy chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus): 11 chickens were inoculated with a brain ganglioside extract in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) and six chickens inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline. A second study was performed five healthy quaker parrots (Myiopsitta monachus) that were divided into three groups: Two quaker parrots received purified gangliosides in FCA, two received a crude brain extract in FCA, and one control quaker parrot received FCA alone. One chicken developed difficult in walking. Histologically, only a mild perivascular and perineural lymphocytic infiltrate in the proventriculus. Two quaker parrots (one from each treatment group) had mild lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis and myelitis. However, none of the quaker parrots developed myenteric ganglioneuritis, suggesting that autoantibodies against gangliosides in birds are not associated with a condition resembling PDD.

"Ixodes persulcatus (n = 125) and Dermacentor reticulatus (n = 84) ticks from Western Siberia, Russia, were tested for infection with Borrelia, Anaplasma/Ehrlichia, Bartonella, and Babesia spp. by using nested polymerase chain reaction assays with subsequent sequencing. I. persulcatus ticks were infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (37.6% +/- 4.3% [standard deviation]), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (2.4% +/- 1.4%), Ehrlichia muris (8.8% +/- 2.5%), and Bartonella spp. (37.6% +/- 4.3%). D. reticulatus ticks contained DNA of B. burgdorferi sensu lato (3.6% +/- 2.0%), Bartonella spp. (21.4% +/- 4.5%), and Babesia canis canis (3.6% +/- 2.0%). Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, and their mixed infections were observed among I. persulcatus, whereas B. garinii NT29 DNA was seen in samples from D. reticulatus. Among the I. persulcatus ticks studied, no Babesia spp. were observed, whereas B. canis canis was the single subspecies found in D. reticulatus.

"Concern over the release of variola virus as an agent of bioterrorism remains high and a rapid vaccination regimen is desirable for use in the event of a confirmed release of virus. A single, high-dose (5×10(8) TCID50) of Bavarian Nordic's IMVAMUNE was tested in a Phase-II clinical trial, in humans, as a substitute for the standard (1×10(8) TCID50), using a 2-dose, 28-days apart regimen. Prior to this clinical trial taking place a Good Laboratory Practice, repeated high-dose, toxicology study was performed using IMVAMUNE, in New Zealand white rabbits and the results are reported here. Male and female rabbits were dosed twice, subcutaneously, with 5×10(8) TCID50 of IMVAMUNE (test) or saline (control), 7-days apart. The clinical condition, body-weight, food consumption, haematology, blood chemistry, immunogenicity, organ-weight, and macroscopic and microscopic pathology were investigated. Haematological investigations indicated changes within the white blood cell profile that were attributed to treatment with IMVAMUNE; these comprised slight increases in neutrophil and monocyte numbers, on study days 1-3 and a marginal increase in lymphocyte numbers on day 10. Macroscopic pathology revealed reddening at the sites of administration and thickened skin in IMVAMUNE, treated animals. After the second dose of IMVAMUNE 9/10 rabbits seroconverted, as detected by antibody ELISA on day 10, by day 21, 10/10 rabbits seroconverted. Treatment-related changes were not detected in other parameters. In conclusion, the subcutaneous injection of 2 high-doses of IMVAMUNE, to rabbits, was well tolerated producing only minor changes at the site of administration. Vaccinia-specific antibodies were raised in IMVAMUNE-vaccinated rabbits only.

"Molecular diagnostics (PCR and RT-PCR) have become commonplace in laboratory animal research and diagnostics, augmenting or replacing serological and microbiologic methods. This overview will discuss the uses of molecular diagnostics in the diagnosis of pathogenic infections of laboratory animals and in monitoring the microbial status of laboratory animals and their environment. The article will focus primarily on laboratory rodents, although PCR can be used on samples from any laboratory animal species.

"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of avian haemosporidian parasites and the factors influencing infection in the Colorado Rocky Mountains are largely unknown. With climate change expected to promote the expansion of vector and avian blood parasite distributions, baseline knowledge and continued monitoring of the prevalence and diversity of these parasites is needed. METHODS: Using an occupancy modeling framework, we conducted a survey of haemosporidian parasite species infecting an avian community in the Colorado Rocky Mountains in order to estimate the prevalence and diversity of blood parasites and to investigate species-level and individual-level characteristics that may influence infection. RESULTS: We estimated the prevalence and diversity of avian Haemosporidia across 24 bird species, detecting 39 parasite haplotypes. We found that open-cup nesters have higher Haemoproteus prevalence than cavity or ground nesters. Additionally, we found that male Ruby-crowned Kinglets, White-crowned Sparrows, and Wilson's Warblers have higher Haemoproteus prevalence compared to other host species. Plasmodium prevalence was relatively low (5%), consistent with the idea that competent vectors may be rare at high altitudes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presents baseline knowledge of haemosporidian parasite presence, prevalence, and diversity among avian species in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and adds to our knowledge of host-parasite relationships of blood parasites and their avian hosts.

"Pain management in rabbits can be difficult because they are adept at hiding pain and can be stressed by handling and restraint for injection. The use of opioid analgesics with prolonged durations of activity could alleviate pain, but associated adverse effects including gastrointestinal ileus, inappetence, and tissue reactions have been reported. In this study, we compared gross tissue reactions at the site of injection, food consumption, and fecal production after single injections of buprenorphine HCl (Bup; n = 7), sustained-release buprenorphine (BupSR; n = 8), and high-concentration buprenorphine (BupHC; n = 7) during the first 3 d after minor survival surgery. We also measured plasma concentrations of the parent drug, buprenorphine, and 3 metabolites (buprenorphine-3-glucuronide (B3G), norbuprenorphine-3β-glucuronide (N3G), and norbuprenorphine (NB)). Plasma levels of buprenorphine remained above the theoretical minimal analgesic concentration for 4 h for Bup and 42 h for BupHC. For BupSR, plasma levels of buprenorphine remained above the theoretical minimal analgesic concentration for approximately 77 h, starting 15 h after administration. For all 3 formulations, N3G was the most prominent metabolite in the blood. No injection site reactions were visible grossly in any rabbit. Relative to baseline measures and compared with controls (n = 8), food consumption was suppressed on days 1 through 3 in rabbits that received BupSR and on days 2 through 3 in those given BupHC. Feces production on day 3 was reduced to a greater extent in BupSR rabbits than control animals. Two rabbits in the BupHC group exhibited neurologic signs after drug administration. These adverse effects should be considered when choosing a long-lasting buprenorphine formulation to manage pain in rabbits.

"BACKGROUND: Cases of Lyme borreliosis, a vector-borne zoonosis caused by bacteria in the Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) species group, have increased in recent years in Europe. Knowledge of environmental factors associated with abundance of the tick vector Ixodes ricinus and the pathogen B. burgdorferi (s.l.) is of interest to understand responses to environmental changes, predict variation in risk and to inform management interventions. METHODS: Nineteen woodland sites across Scotland were surveyed in 2012 for B. burgdorferi (s.l.) infection in questing I. ricinus nymphs (n = 200 per site), deer abundance and vegetation. Climatic factors were extracted for each site. Six additional sites were surveyed for questing nymphs in both 2012 and 2013 (n = 200 per site and year) to test for variation in B. burgdorferi (s.l.) prevalence between years. RESULTS: The mean prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) across 19 sites was 1.7% (95% CI: 1.4-2.2%; range 0-6%), all four genospecies known to be present in the UK were detected: B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) and B. valaisiana. A higher prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.), higher densities of nymphs and higher densities of infected nymphs were found at sites with warmer climates, estimated with growing degree-days. No association between infection prevalence in nymphs and woodland type (semi-natural mixed vs coniferous) or deer density was found. At six sites sampled in 2012 and 2013, there was a significant increase in B. afzelli prevalence at two sites and a decrease in B. garinii prevalence at one site. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights challenges for the prediction of risk of Lyme borreliosis, reflecting the sensitivity of both pathogen and vector ecology to habitat, host and climatic factors. Significant changes in the prevalence of individual genospecies at sites monitored across time are likely to be due to variability in the host community composition between years. Our results indicate the importance of monitoring dynamic variables such as reservoir host populations as well as climate and habitat factors over multiple years, to identify environmental factors associated with Lyme borreliosis risk.

"Three great plague pandemics caused by the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis have killed nearly 200 million people and it has been linked to biowarfare in the past. Plague is endemic in many parts of the world. In addition, the risk of plague as a bioweapon has prompted increased research to develop plague vaccines against this disease. Injectable subunit vaccines are being developed in the United States and United Kingdom.  However, the live attenuated Y. pestis-EV NIIEG strain has been used as a vaccine for more than 70 years in the former Soviet Union and in some parts of Asia and provides a high degree of efficacy against plague.  This vaccine has not gained general acceptance because of safety concerns.  In recent years, modern molecular biological techniques have been applied to Y. pestis to construct strains with specific defined mutations designed to create safe, immunogenic vaccines with potential for use in humans and as bait vaccines to reduce the load of Y. pestis in the environment.  In addition, a number of live, vectored vaccines have been reported using attenuated viral vectors or attenuated Salmonella strains to deliver plague antigens. Here we summarize the progress of live attenuated vaccines against plagu.

"Muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) were exposed experimentally by various routes to a chlamydial agent (designated strain M56) originally isolated during a die-off of muskrats and snowshoe hares which occurred in Saskatchewan during 1961. Both species were susceptible to experimental infection. Whereas M56 was highly lethal for snowshoe hares (18 deaths/19 exposed), it was less virulent for muskrats (6 deaths/20 exposed). The degree of susceptibility of muskrats to induced infections with M56 was influenced by the presence or absence of specific antibodies at the time of exposure. A febrile illness was observed in 11 of 20 muskrats. In the six that died, widespread focal necrosis was found in the liver. Following intraperitoneal or oral exposures, chronic infections were established and the agent was recovered from the brain and the small intestine up to 96 days post-infection. Specific antibodies were found in 11.8% of 127 sera of muskrats trapped form the wild in Saskatchewan, the Canadian Arctic, and Wisconsin. In snowshoe hares, M56 induced an acute, febrile, emaciating illness, and the almost invariable fatal course was short with terminal signs of opisthotonos, convulsions, and hypoglycemia. Snowshoe hares succumbed with intravenous doses of less than ten mouse intracerebral LD(50) of M56. The same syndrome was produced by intravenous, subcutaneous, and oral infections. M56 was found in high titers in all tissues examined. The highest titers were found in the liver and spleen which correlated with the pathology observed. M56 was recovered from female rabbit ticks (Haemaphysalis leporispalustris) engorging on experimentally infected snowshoe hares.

"Self-cleaving ribozymes are genetic elements found in all domains of life, but their evolution remains poorly understood. A ribozyme located in the second intron of the cytoplasmic polyadenylation binding protein 3 gene (CPEB3) shows high sequence conservation in mammals, but little is known about the functional conservation of self-cleaving ribozyme activity across the mammalian tree of life or during the course of mammalian evolution. Here, we use a phylogenetic approach to design a mutational library and a deep sequencing assay to evaluate the in vitro self-cleavage activity of numerous extant and resurrected CPEB3 ribozymes that span over 100 My of mammalian evolution. We found that the predicted sequence at the divergence of placentals and marsupials is highly active, and this activity has been conserved in most lineages. A reduction in ribozyme activity appears to have occurred multiple different times throughout the mammalian tree of life. The in vitro activity data allow an evaluation of the predicted mutational pathways leading to extant ribozyme as well as the mutational landscape surrounding these ribozymes. The results demonstrate that in addition to sequence conservation, the self-cleavage activity of the CPEB3 ribozyme has persisted over millions of years of mammalian evolution.

"Variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1) is a zoonotic virus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans who are infected after contact with exotic squirrels. We analyzed the brain lesions and the immune responses in all 4 known human cases that showed panencephalitis. Inflammatory infiltrates in areas positive for VSBV-1 RNA and antigen consisted of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with perivascular B-cell accumulation. Strong microglial response and bizarre astroglial expansion were present. Areas of malacia contained neutrophils and foamy microglia and macrophages. Immunopathologic examination during infection showed cleavage of caspase 3 in brain cells adjacent to CD8+ cells and widespread p53 expression, hallmarks of apoptosis. Cerebrospinal fluid analyses over time demonstrated increasing protein concentrations and cell counts, paralleled by pathologic lactate elevations in all patients. The most severe cerebrospinal fluid and histologic changes occurred in the patient with the highest viral load, shortest duration of disease, and most medical preconditions.

"Understanding the spread of infectious diseases is crucial for implementing effective control measures. For this, it is important to obtain information on the contemporary population structure of a disease agent and to infer the evolutionary processes that may have shaped it. Here, we investigate on a continental scale the population structure of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis (LB), a tick-borne disease, in North America. We test the hypothesis that the observed population structure is congruent with recent population expansions and that these were preceded by bottlenecks mostly likely caused by the near extirpation in the 1900s of hosts required for sustaining tick populations. Multilocus sequence typing and complementary population analytical tools were used to evaluate B. burgdorferi samples collected in the Northeastern, Upper Midwestern, and Far-Western United States and Canada. The spatial distribution of sequence types (STs) and inferred population boundaries suggest that the current populations are geographically separated. One major population boundary separated western B. burgdorferi populations transmitted by Ixodes pacificus in California from Eastern populations transmitted by I. scapularis; the other divided Midwestern and Northeastern populations. However, populations from all three regions were genetically closely related. Together, our findings suggest that although the contemporary populations of North American B. burgdorferi now comprise three geographically separated subpopulations with no or limited gene flow among them, they arose from a common ancestral population. A comparative analysis of the B. burgdorferi outer surface protein C (ospC) gene revealed novel linkages and provides additional insights into the genetic characteristics of strains.

"Changes in concentration of pollutants and pathogen distribution can vary among ecotypes (e.g. marine versus terrestrial food resources). This may have important implications for the animals that reside within them. We examined 1) canid pathogen presence in an endangered arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) population and 2) relative total mercury (THg) level as a function of ecotype ('coastal' or 'inland') for arctic foxes to test whether the presence of pathogens or heavy metal concentration correlate with population health. The Bering Sea populations on Bering and Mednyi Islands were compared to Icelandic arctic fox populations with respect to inland and coastal ecotypes. Serological and DNA based pathogen screening techniques were used to examine arctic foxes for pathogens. THg was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry from hair samples of historical and modern collected arctic foxes and samples from their prey species (hair and internal organs). Presence of pathogens did not correlate with population decline from Mednyi Island. However, THg concentration correlated strongly with ecotype and was reflected in the THg concentrations detected in available food sources in each ecotype. The highest concentration of THg was found in ecotypes where foxes depended on marine vertebrates for food. Exclusively inland ecotypes had low THg concentrations. The results suggest that absolute exposure to heavy metals may be less important than the feeding ecology and feeding opportunities of top predators such as arctic foxes which may in turn influence population health and stability. A higher risk to wildlife of heavy metal exposure correlates with feeding strategies that rely primarily on a marine based diet.

"West Nile virus (WNV) continues to be a major cause of human arboviral neuroinvasive disease. Susceptible non-human vertebrates are particularly diverse, ranging from commonly affected birds and horses to less commonly affected species such as alligators. This review summarizes the pathology caused by West Nile virus during natural infections of humans and non-human animals. While the most well-known findings in human infection involve the central nervous system, WNV can also cause significant lesions in the heart, kidneys and eyes. Time has also revealed chronic neurologic sequelae related to prior human WNV infection. Similarly, neurologic disease is a prominent manifestation of WNV infection in most non-human non-host animals. However, in some avian species, which serve as the vertebrate host for WNV maintenance in nature, severe systemic disease can occur, with neurologic, cardiac, intestinal and renal injury leading to death. The pathology seen in experimental animal models of West Nile virus infection and knowledge gains on viral pathogenesis derived from these animal models are also briefly discussed. A gap in the current literature exists regarding the relationship between the neurotropic nature of WNV in vertebrates, virus propagation and transmission in nature. This and other knowledge gaps, and future directions for research into WNV pathology, are addressed.

"Diving response (DR) is a powerful integrative response targeted toward survival of the hypoxic/anoxic conditions. Being present in all animals and humans, it allows to survive adverse conditions like diving. Earlier, we discovered that forehead stimulation affords neuroprotective effect, decreasing infarction volume triggered by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery in rats. We hypothesized that cold stimulation of the forehead induces DR in rats, which, in turn, exerts neuroprotection. We compared autonomic [AP, heart rate (HR), cerebral blood flow (CBF)] and EEG responses to the known DR-triggering stimulus, ammonia stimulation of the nasal mucosa, cold stimulation of the forehead, and cold stimulation of the glabrous skin of the tail base in anesthetized rats. Responses in AP, HR, CBF, and EEG to cold stimulation of the forehead and ammonia vapors instillation into the nasal cavity were comparable and differed significantly from responses to the cold stimulation of the tail base. Excitotoxic lesion of the subthalamic vasodilator area (SVA), which is known to participate in CBF regulation and to afford neuroprotection upon excitation, failed to affect autonomic components of the DR evoked by forehead cold stimulation or nasal mucosa ammonia stimulation. We conclude that cold stimulation of the forehead triggers physiological response comparable to the response evoked by ammonia vapor instillation into nasal cavity, which is considered as stimulus triggering protective DR. These observations may explain the neuroprotective effect of the forehead stimulation. Data demonstrate that SVA does not directly participate in the autonomic adjustments accompanying DR; however, it is involved in diving-evoked modulation of EEG. We suggest that forehead stimulation can be employed as a stimulus capable of triggering oxygen-conserving DR and can be used for neuroprotective therapy.

"The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a major international public health concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 11, 2020. In Panama, the first SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed on March 9, 2020, and the first fatal case associated to COVID-19 was reported on March 10. This report presents the case of a 44-year-old female who arrived at the hospital with a respiratory failure, five days after the first fatal COVID-19 case, and who was living in a region where hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases caused by Choclo orthohantavirus (CHOV), are prevalent. Thus, the clinical personnel set a differential diagnosis to determine a respiratory disease caused by the endemic CHOV or the new pandemic SARS-CoV-2. This case investigation describes the first coinfection by SARS-CoV-2 and CHOV worldwide. PCR detected both viruses during early stages of the disease and the genomic sequences were obtained. The presence of antibodies was determined during the patient’s hospitalization. After 23 days at the intensive care unit, the patient survived with no sequelae, and antibodies against CHOV and SARS-CoV-2 were still detectable 12 months after the disease. The detection of the coinfection in this patient highlights the importance, during a pandemic, of complementing the testing and diagnosis of the emergent agent, SARS-CoV-2, with other common endemic respiratory pathogens and other zoonotic pathogens, like CHOV, in regions where they are of public health concern.

"Most mammalian populations suffer from natural or human-induced disturbances; populations are no longer at the equilibrium (i.e., at stable [st]age distribution) and exhibit transient dynamics. From a literature survey, we studied patterns of transient dynamics for mammalian species spanning a large range of life-history tactics and population growth rates. For each population, we built an age-structured matrix and calculated six metrics of transient dynamics. After controlling for possible confounding effects of the phylogenetic relatedness among species using a phylogenetic principal component analysis and phylogenetic generalized least squares models, we found that short-term demographic responses of mammalian populations to disturbance are shaped by generation time and growth rate. Species with a slow pace of life (i.e., species with a late maturity, a low fecundity, and a long life span) displayed decreases in population size after a disturbance, whereas fast-living species increased in population size. The magnitude of short-term variation in population size increased with asymptotic population growth, being buffered in slow-growing species (i.e., species with a low population growth rate) but large in fast-growing species. By demonstrating direct links between transient dynamics, life history (generation time), and ecology (demographic regime), our comparative analysis of transient dynamics clearly improves our understanding of population dynamics in variable environments and has clear implications for future studies of the interplay between evolutionary and ecological dynamics. As most populations in the wild are not at equilibrium, we recommend that analyses of transient dynamics be performed when studying population dynamics in variable environments.

"In the late 1990s and early 2000s it was recognized that behavioral ecologists needed to study the sociality of caviomorph rodents (New World hystricognaths) before generalizations about rodent sociality could be made. Researchers identified specific problems facing individuals interested in caviomorph sociality, including a lack of information on the proximate mechanisms of sociality, role of social environment in development, and geographical or intraspecific variation in social systems. Since then researchers have described the social systems of many previously understudied species, including some with broad geographical ranges. Researchers have done a good job of determining the role of social environments in development and identifying the costs and benefits of social living. However, relatively little is known about the proximate mechanisms of social behavior and fitness consequences, limiting progress toward the development of integrative (evolutionary-mechanistic) models for sociality. To develop integrative models behavioral ecologists studying caviomorph rodents must generate information on the fitness consequences of different types of social organization, brain mechanisms, and endocrine substrates of sociality. We review our current understanding and future directions for research in these conceptual areas. A greater understanding of disease ecology, particularly in species carrying Old World parasites, is needed before we can identify potential links between social phenotypes, mechanism, and fitness.

"Proprotein convertases subtilisin kexins are serine endoproteases, playing critical roles in the biological functions, including lipid, glucose, and bile acid metabolism, as well as cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis. Experimental studies have demonstrated the physiological functions of PCSKs and their association with diseases; however, studies on the evolutionary history and diversification of these proteins are missing. In the present research, a bioinformatics study was conducted on the molecular evolution of several PCSKs family members and gene loss events across placental mammalian. In order to detect evolutionary constraints and positive selection, the CodeML program of the PAML package was used. The results showed the positive selection to occur in PCSK1, PCSK3, PCSK5, and PCSK7. A decelerated rate of evolution was observed in PCSK7, PCSK3, and MBTPS1 in Carnivores compared to the rest of phylogeny, and an accelerated evolution of PCSK1, PCSK7, and MBTPS1 in Muridae family of rodents was found. Additionally, our results indicated pcsk9 gene loss in 12 species comprising Carnivores and bats (Chiroptera). Future studies are required to evaluate the functional relevance and selective evolutionary advantages associated with these modifications in PCSK proteins during evolution.

"Zoonoses, which account for approximately 75% of emerging human infectious diseases worldwide, pose a re-emerging threat to public health. With an ever-increasing interrelationship between humans, livestock and wildlife species, the threat to human health will rise to unprecedented levels. Wildlife species contribute to the majority of emerging diseases; therefore, there is an urgent need to define control systems of zoonoses of wildlife origin but very little information exists. In this review, we examine prevalent zoonotic infections reported in Namibia between 1990 and 2009 and assess their potential impact on the growing wildlife industry. A wide spectrum of zoonotic diseases was confirmed in both livestock and wildlife species, with rabies and anthrax cases being over-represented and also showing the widest species distribution. Whilst vaccination and ante-mortem inspection against these diseases may curb infected livestock species from entering the human food chain, such practices are difficult to implement in free-ranging wildlife species. In this context, there is a need to improve existing control measures and/or develop novel and better interventional strategies to reduce the threat of this re-emerging global problem. This review provides the basis for initiating a multidisciplinary evidence-based approach to control zoonoses in countries with thriving wildlife and game farming.

"In recent years, the known distribution of vector-borne diseases in Europe has changed, with much new information also available now on the status of vectors in the United Kingdom (UK). For example, in 2016, the UK reported their first detection of the non-native mosquito Aedes albopictus, which is a known vector for dengue and chikungunya virus. In 2010, Culex modestus, a principal mosquito vector for West Nile virus was detected in large numbers in the Thames estuary. For tick-borne diseases, data on the changing distribution of the Lyme borreliosis tick vector, Ixodes ricinus, has recently been published, at a time when there has been an increase in the numbers of reported human cases of Lyme disease. This paper brings together the latest surveillance data and pertinent research on vector-borne disease in the UK, and its relevance to public health. It highlights the need for continued vector surveillance systems to monitor our native mosquito and tick fauna, as well as the need to expand surveillance for invasive species. It illustrates the importance of maintaining surveillance capacity that is sufficient to ensure accurate and timely disease risk assessment to help mitigate the UK's changing emerging infectious disease risks, especially in a time of climatic and environmental change and increasing global connectivity.

"The pulvinar is a higher-order thalamic relay and a central component of the extrageniculate visual pathway, with input from the superior colliculus and visual cortex and output to all of visual cortex. Rodent pulvinar, more commonly called the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), consists of three highly-conserved subdivisions, and offers the advantage of simplicity in its study compared to more subdivided primate pulvinar. Little is known about receptive field properties of LP, let alone whether functional differences exist between different LP subdivisions, making it difficult to understand what visual information is relayed and what kinds of computations the pulvinar might support. Here, we characterized single-cell response properties in two V1 recipient subdivisions of rat pulvinar, the rostromedial (LPrm) and lateral (LPl), and found that a fourth of the cells were selective for orientation, compared to half in V1, and that LP tuning widths were significantly broader. Response latencies were also significantly longer and preferred size more than three times larger on average than in V1; the latter suggesting pulvinar as a source of spatial context to V1. Between subdivisons, LPl cells preferred higher temporal frequencies, whereas LPrm showed a greater degree of direction selectivity and pattern motion detection. Taken together with known differences in connectivity patterns, these results suggest two separate visual feature processing channels in the pulvinar, one in LPl related to higher speed processing which likely derives from superior colliculus input, and the other in LPrm for motion processing derived through input from visual cortex. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The pulvinar has a perplexing role in visual cognition as no clear link has been found between the functional properties of its neurons and behavioral deficits that arise when it is damaged. The pulvinar, called the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) in rats, is a higher order thalamic relay with input from the superior colliculus and visual cortex and output to all of visual cortex. By characterizing single-cell response properties in anatomically distinct subdivisions we found two separate visual feature processing channels in the pulvinar, one in lateral LP related to higher speed processing which likely derives from superior colliculus input, and the other in rostromedial LP for motion processing derived through input from visual cortex.

"The maintenance of infectious diseases requires a sufficient number of susceptible hosts. Host culling is a potential control strategy for animal diseases. However, the reduction in biodiversity and increasing public concerns regarding the involved ethical issues have progressively challenged the use of wildlife culling. Here, we assess the potential of wildlife culling as an epidemiologically sound management tool, by examining the host ecology, pathogen characteristics, eco-sociological contexts, and field work constraints. We also discuss alternative solutions and make recommendations for the appropriate implementation of culling for disease control.

"OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) microbiome approaches in the diagnosis of infectious disorders in brain or spinal cord biopsies in patients with suspected CNS infections. METHODS: In a prospective pilot study, we applied NGS in combination with a new computational analysis pipeline to detect the presence of pathogenic microbes in brain or spinal cord biopsies from 10 patients with neurologic problems indicating possible infection but for whom conventional clinical and microbiology studies yielded negative or inconclusive results. RESULTS: Direct DNA and RNA sequencing of brain tissue biopsies generated 8.3 million to 29.1 million sequence reads per sample, which successfully identified with high confidence the infectious agent in 3 patients for whom validation techniques confirmed the pathogens identified by NGS. Although NGS was unable to identify with precision infectious agents in the remaining cases, it contributed to the understanding of neuropathologic processes in 5 others, demonstrating the power of large-scale unbiased sequencing as a novel diagnostic tool. Clinical outcomes were consistent with the findings yielded by NGS on the presence or absence of an infectious pathogenic process in 8 of 10 cases, and were noncontributory in the remaining 2. CONCLUSIONS: NGS-guided metagenomic studies of brain, spinal cord, or meningeal biopsies offer the possibility for dramatic improvements in our ability to detect (or rule out) a wide range of CNS pathogens, with potential benefits in speed, sensitivity, and cost. NGS-based microbiome approaches present a major new opportunity to investigate the potential role of infectious pathogens in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory disorders.

"Smallpox, caused by the solely human pathogen Variola virus (VARV), was declared eradicated in 1980. While known VARV stocks are secure, smallpox remains a bioterrorist threat agent. Recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the first smallpox anti-viral (tecovirimat) therapeutic was a successful step forward in smallpox preparedness; however, orthopoxviruses can become resistant to treatment, suggesting a multi-therapeutic approach is necessary. Animal models are required for testing medical countermeasures (MCMs) and ideally MCMs are tested directly against the pathogen of interest. Since VARV only infects humans, a representative animal model for testing therapeutics directly against VARV remains a challenge. Here we show that three different humanized mice strains are highly susceptible to VARV infection, establishing the first small animal model using VARV. In comparison, the non-humanized, immunosuppressed background mouse was not susceptible to systemic VARV infection. Following an intranasal VARV challenge that mimics the natural route for human smallpox transmission, the virus spread systemically within the humanized mouse before mortality (~ 13 days post infection), similar to the time from exposure to symptom onset for ordinary human smallpox. Our identification of a permissive/representative VARV animal model can facilitate testing of MCMs in a manner consistent with their intended use.

"West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) is a widely distributed arthropod-borne virus that has negatively affected human health and animal populations. WNV infection rates of mosquitoes and human cases have been shown to be correlated with climate. However, previous studies have been conducted at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and the scale-dependence of these relationships has been understudied. We tested the hypothesis that climate variables are important to understand these relationships at all spatial scales. We analyzed the influence of climate on WNV infection rate of mosquitoes and number of human cases in New York and Connecticut using Random Forests, a machine learning technique. During model development, 66 climate-related variables based on temperature, precipitation and soil moisture were tested for predictive skill. We also included 20-21 non-climatic variables to account for known environmental effects (e.g., land cover and human population), surveillance related information (e.g., relative mosquito abundance), and to assess the potential explanatory power of other relevant factors (e.g., presence of wastewater treatment plants). Random forest models were used to identify the most important climate variables for explaining spatial-temporal variation in mosquito infection rates (abbreviated as MLE). The results of the cross-validation support our hypothesis that climate variables improve the predictive skill for MLE at county- and trap-scales and for human cases at the county-scale. Of the climate-related variables selected, mean minimum temperature from July-September was selected in all analyses, and soil moisture was selected for the mosquito county-scale analysis. Models demonstrated predictive skill, but still over- and under-estimated WNV MLE and numbers of human cases. Models at fine spatial scales had lower absolute errors but had greater errors relative to the mean infection rates.

"Identifying the causative pathogen in central nervous system (CNS) infections is crucial for patient management and prognosis. Many viruses can cause CNS infections, yet screening for each individually is costly and time-consuming. Most metagenomic assays can theoretically detect all pathogens, but often fail to detect viruses because of their small genome and low viral load. Viral metagenomics overcomes this by enrichment of the viral genomic content in a sample. VIDISCA-NGS is one of the available workflows for viral metagenomics, which requires only a small input volume and allows multiplexing of multiple samples per run. The performance of VIDISCA-NGS was tested on 45 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with suspected CNS infections in which a virus was identified and quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Eighteen were positive for an RNA virus, and 34 for a herpesvirus. VIDISCA-NGS detected all RNA viruses with a viral load >2 × 10(4) RNA copies/mL (n = 6) and 8 of 12 of the remaining low load samples. Only one herpesvirus was identified by VIDISCA-NGS, however, when withholding a DNase treatment, 11 of 18 samples with a herpesvirus load >10(4) DNA copies/mL were detected. Our results indicate that VIDISCA-NGS has the capacity to detect low load RNA viruses in CSF. Herpesvirus DNA in clinical samples is probably non-encapsidated and therefore difficult to detect by VIDISCA-NGS.

"BACKGROUND: Human encephalitis can originate from a variety of different aetiologies, of which infection is the most common one. The diagnostic work-up is specifically challenging in patients with travel history since a broader spectrum of unfamiliar additional infectious agents, e. g. tropical disease pathogens, needs to be considered. Here we present a case of encephalitis of unclear aetiology in a female traveller returning from Africa, who in addition developed an atypical herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis in close temporal relation with high-dose steroid treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 48-year-old female presented with confusion syndrome and impaired vigilance which had developed during a six-day trip to The Gambia. The condition rapidly worsened to a comatose state. Extensive search for infectious agents including a variety of tropical disease pathogens was unsuccessful. As encephalitic signs persisted despite of calculated antimicrobial and antiviral therapy, high-dose corticosteroids were applied intravenously based on the working diagnosis of an autoimmune encephalitis. The treatment did, however, not improve the patient's condition. Four days later, bihemispheric signal amplification in the insular and frontobasal cortex was observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The intracranial pressure rapidly increased and could not be controlled by conservative treatment. The patient died due to tonsillar herniation 21 days after onset of symptoms. Histological examination of postmortem brain tissue demonstrated a generalized lymphocytic meningoencephalitis. Immunohistochemical reactions against HSV-1/2 indicated an atypical manifestation of herpesviral encephalitis in brain tissue. Moreover, HSV-1 DNA was detected by a next-generation sequencing (NGS) metagenomics approach. Retrospective analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples revealed HSV-1 DNA only in specimens one day ante mortem. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that standard high-dose steroid therapy can contribute to or possibly even trigger fulminant cerebral HSV reactivation in a critically ill patient. Thus, even if extensive laboratory diagnostics including wide-ranging search for infectious pathogens has been performed before and remained without results, continuous re-evaluation of potential differential diagnoses especially regarding opportunistic infections or reactivation of latent infections is of utmost importance, particularly if new symptoms occur.

"We barcoded 25 in vitro isolates (representing 92 samples) of Giardia duodenalis from humans and other animals, which have been assembled by the Upcroft team at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research over a period of almost three decades. We used mutation scanning-coupled sequencing of loci in the triosephosphate isomerase, glutamate dehydrogenase and β-giardin genes, combined with phylogenetic analysis, to genetically characterise them. Specifically, the isolates (n514) of G. duodenalis from humans from Australia (AD113; BRIS/83/HEPU/106; BRIS/87/HEPU/713; BRIS/89/HEPU/1003; BRIS/92/HEPU/1541; BRIS/92/HEPU/1590; BRIS/92/HEPU/2443; BRIS/93/HEPU/1706), Malaysia (KL/92/IMR/1106) and Afghanistan (WB), a cat from Australia (BAC2), a sheep from Canada (OAS1) and a sulphur-crested cockatoo from Australia (BRIS/95/HEPU/2041) represented assemblage A (sub-assemblage AI-1, AI-2 or AII-2); isolates (n510) from humans from Australia (BRIS/91/HEPU/1279; BRIS/92/HEPU/2342; BRIS/92/HEPU/2348; BRIS/93/HEPU/1638; BRIS/93/HEPU/1653; BRIS/93/HEPU/1705; BRIS/93/HEPU/1718; BRIS/93/HEPU/1727), Papua New Guinea (BRIS/92/HEPU/1487) and Canada (H7) represented assemblage B (sub-assemblage BIV) and an isolate from cattle from Australia (BRIS/92/HEPU/1709) had a match to assemblage E. Isolate BRIS/90/HEPU/1229 from a human from Australia was shown to represent a mixed population of assemblages A and B. These barcoded isolates (including stocks and derived lines) now allow direct comparisons of experimental data among laboratories and represent a massive resource for transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolic and functional genomic studies using advanced molecular technologies.

"Human neurons rapidly die after ischemia and current therapies for stroke management are limited to restoration of blood flow to prevent further brain damage. Thrombolytics and mechanical thrombectomy are the available reperfusion treatments, but most of the patients remain untreated. Neuroprotective therapies focused on treating the pathogenic cascade of the disease have widely failed. However, many animal species demonstrate that neurons can survive the lack of oxygen for extended periods of time. Here, we reviewed the physiological and molecular pathways inherent to tolerant species that have been described to contribute to hypoxia tolerance. Among them, Foxo3 and Eif5A were reported to mediate anoxic survival in Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively, and those results were confirmed in experimental models of stroke. In humans however, the multiple mechanisms involved in brain cell death after a stroke causes translation difficulties to arise making necessary a timely and coordinated control of the pathological changes. We propose here that, if we were able to plagiarize such natural hypoxia tolerance through drugs combined in a pharmacological cocktail it would open new therapeutic opportunities for stroke and likely, for other hypoxic conditions.

"In this work a mathematical model is built in order to validate on theoretical grounds field study results on a three-species system made of two prey, of which one is native and another one invasive, together with a native predator. Specifically, our results mathematically describe the negative effect on the native European hare after the introduction of the invasive Eastern cottontail, mediated by an increased predation rate by foxes. Two nonexclusive assumptions can be made: an increase in cottontail abundance would lead to a larger fox population, magnifying their predatory impact (""hyperpredation"") on hares; alternatively, cottontails attract foxes in patches where they live, which are also important resting sites for hares and consequently the increased presence of foxes results in a higher predation rates on hares. The model results support hyperpredation of increasing fox populations on native hares.

"In the mammalian visual system, information from the retina streams into parallel bottom-up pathways. It remains unclear how these pathways interact to contribute to contextual modulation of visual cortical processing. By optogenetic inactivation and activation of mouse lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of thalamus, a homolog of pulvinar, or its projection to primary visual cortex (V1), we found that LP contributes to surround suppression of layer (L) 2/3 responses in V1 by driving L1 inhibitory neurons. This results in subtractive suppression of visual responses and an overall enhancement of orientation, direction, spatial, and size selectivity. Neurons in V1-projecting LP regions receive bottom-up input from the superior colliculus (SC) and respond preferably to non-patterned visual noise. The noise-dependent LP activity allows V1 to ""cancel"" noise effects and maintain its orientation selectivity under varying noise background. Thus, the retina-SC-LP-V1 pathway forms a differential circuit with the canonical retino-geniculate pathway to achieve context-dependent sharpening of visual representations.

"Flaviviruses are globally distributed pathogens causing millions of human infections every year. Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses and are mainly transmitted by either ticks or mosquitoes. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses and their interactions with the innate immune response have been well-studied and reviewed extensively, thus this review will discuss tick-borne flaviviruses and their interactions with the host innate immune response.

"The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) has been valuable as a primate model in biomedical research. Interest in this species has grown recently, in part due to the successful demonstration of transgenic marmosets. Here we examine the prospects of the marmoset model for visual neuroscience research, adopting a comparative framework to place the marmoset within a broader evolutionary context. The marmoset's small brain bears most of the organizational features of other primates, and its smooth surface offers practical advantages over the macaque for areal mapping, laminar electrode penetration, and two-photon and optical imaging. Behaviorally, marmosets are more limited at performing regimented psychophysical tasks, but do readily accept the head restraint that is necessary for accurate eye tracking and neurophysiology, and can perform simple discriminations. Their natural gaze behavior closely resembles that of other primates, with a tendency to focus on objects of social interest including faces. Their immaturity at birth and routine twinning also makes them ideal for the study of postnatal visual development. These experimental factors, together with the theoretical advantages inherent in comparing anatomy, physiology, and behavior across related species, make the marmoset an excellent model for visual neuroscience.

"Green turtles (Chelonia mydas) have a hindgut fermentation digestive tract, which uses cellulolytic microbes to break down plant matter in the cecum and proximal colon. Previous studies on bacterial communities of green turtles have not identified in situ hindgut microbiota, and never before in Hawaiian green turtles, which comprise an isolated metapopulation. Fresh samples using sterile swabs were taken from five locations along the gastrointestinal tracts of eight green turtles that had required euthanization. Bacteria were cultured, aerobically and anaerobically, on nutrient agar and four differential and selective media. Samples at three sections along the gastrointestinal tracts of two green turtles were analyzed using 16S metagenomics on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. More than half of the 4 532 104 sequences belonged to the phylum Firmicutes, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, which are characteristic of herbivore gut microbiota. Some microbiota variation existed between turtles and among gastrointestinal sections. The 16S sequence analysis provided a better representation of the total gastrointestinal bacterial community, much of which cannot be cultured using traditional microbial techniques. These metagenomic analyses serve as a foundation for a better understanding of the microbiome of green turtles in the Hawaiian Islands and elsewhere.

"Red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) are native to most of Eurasia; in much of the United Kingdom, they have been supplanted by the non-native grey squirrel, and are considered an endangered species. Very little is known about the range of tick-borne pathogens to which UK red squirrels are exposed. As part of trap-and-release surveys examining prevalence of Mycobacterium spp. in red squirrel populations on two UK islands, Ixodes ricinus ticks were removed from squirrels and PCR screened for Borrelia spp., intracellular arthropod-borne bacteria and the parasitic wasp Ixodiphagus hookeri. At both sites, the most commonly encountered tick-transmitted bacterium was Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (overall minimum prevalence 12.7%), followed by Anaplasma phagocytophilum (overall minimum prevalence 1.6%). Single ticks infected with Spiroplasma were found at both sites, and single ticks infected with Borrelia miyamotoi or an Ehrlichia sp. at one site. Ticks harbouring Wolbachia (overall minimum prevalence 15.2%) were all positive for I. hookeri. Our study shows that UK red squirrels are potentially exposed to a variety of bacterial pathogens via feeding ticks. The effects on the health and survival of this already vulnerable wildlife species are unknown, and further studies are needed to evaluate the threat posed to red squirrels by Borrelia and other tick-borne pathogens.

"Reptiles and amphibians constitute a significant portion of vertebrate biomass in terrestrial ecosystems and may be important arbovirus reservoirs. To investigate mosquito preference for ectothermic hosts, feeding indices were calculated from data collected in Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, USA. Four mosquito species fed upon ectothermic hosts, with Culex peccator and Cx. territans feeding primarily upon ectotherms. These two species appeared to target distinct species with little overlap in host choice. Culex peccator was a generalist in its feeding patterns within ectotherms, and Cx. territans appeared to be a more specialized feeder. Six of eleven ectotherm species fed upon by Cx. territans were fed upon more often than predicted based upon abundance. Spring peepers were highly preferred over other host species by Cx. territans. Blood meals taken from each host species varied temporally, with some hosts being targeted fairly evenly throughout the season and others being fed upon in seasonal peaks.

"Successful establishment of non-native species is strongly influenced, among other factors, by the genetic variation of founding populations, which can be enhanced by multiple introductions through admixture. Coexisting pathogens can also facilitate the establishment of non-native species by detrimentally impacting on the native fauna acting as novel weapons. The signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) is a highly invasive species, which has caused mass declines of native crayfish in Europe through displacement and transmission of the oomycete Aphanomyces astaci (crayfish plague), which is typically lethal to native European crayfish. However, whether Aphanomyces astaci may have facilitated the invasion of the signal crayfish is not known. We estimated the genetic diversity at microsatellite DNA loci, effective population size, and potential origins of seven infected and noninfected signal crayfish populations in Europe and one founder population in North America. Approximate Bayesian computation analysis and population structuring suggested multiple host introductions from diverse source populations, as well as higher heterozygosity among infected than uninfected populations, which could reflect a fitness advantage. Low effective population size, moderate heterozygosity, and lack of isolation by distance suggest that some invasive signal crayfish populations may not be fully established or that their genetic diversity may have been reduced by eradication attempts.

"Naked mole rat (MR) Heterocephalus glaber is a rodent model of delayed aging because of its unusually long life span (>28 years). It is also not known to develop cancer. In the current work, tissue imaging by x-ray fluorescence microscopy and direct analyses of trace elements revealed low levels of selenium in the MR liver and kidney, whereas MR and mouse brains had similar selenium levels. This effect was not explained by uniform selenium deficiency because methionine sulfoxide reductase activities were similar in mice and MR. However, glutathione peroxidase activity was an order of magnitude lower in MR liver and kidney than in mouse tissues. In addition, metabolic labeling of MR cells with (75)Se revealed a loss of the abundant glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) band, whereas other selenoproteins were preserved. To characterize the MR selenoproteome, we sequenced its liver transcriptome. Gene reconstruction revealed standard selenoprotein sequences except for GPx1, which had an early stop codon, and SelP, which had low selenocysteine content. When expressed in HEK 293 cells, MR GPx1 was present in low levels, and its expression could be rescued neither by removing the early stop codon nor by replacing its SECIS element. In addition, GPx1 mRNA was present in lower levels in MR liver than in mouse liver. To determine if GPx1 deficiency could account for the reduced selenium content, we analyzed GPx1 knock-out mice and found reduced selenium levels in their livers and kidneys. Thus, MR is characterized by the reduced utilization of selenium due to a specific defect in GPx1 expression.

"Flaviviruses are a group of positive-sense RNA viruses that are primarily transmitted through arthropod vectors and are capable of causing a broad spectrum of diseases. Many of the flaviviruses that are pathogenic in humans are transmitted specifically through mosquito vectors. Over the past century, many mosquito-borne flavivirus infections have emerged and re-emerged, and are of global importance with hundreds of millions of infections occurring yearly. There is a need for novel, effective, and accessible vaccines and antivirals capable of inhibiting flavivirus infection and ameliorating disease. The development of therapeutics targeting viral entry has long been a goal of antiviral research, but most efforts are hindered by the lack of broad-spectrum potency or toxicities associated with on-target effects, since many host proteins necessary for viral entry are also essential for host cell biology. Mosquito-borne flaviviruses generally enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), and recent studies suggest that a subset of these viruses can be internalized through a specialized form of CME that has additional dependencies distinct from canonical CME pathways, and antivirals targeting this pathway have been discovered. In this review, we discuss the role and contribution of endocytosis to mosquito-borne flavivirus entry as well as consider past and future efforts to target endocytosis for therapeutic interventions.

"The raccoon (Procyon lotor) carnivore native to North America is a fast spreading, invasive species in the Europe now. At the moment, the highest population occupies areas near the German-Polish border. The data on the occurrence of Cryptosporidium spp. and microsporidia in raccoons is limited to North America's territory and is totally lacking in the case of their introduction to Europe. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the occurrence of microparasites, i.e., Cryptosporidium spp. and microsporidia in the introduced raccoons obtained from localities in Poland and Germany. A PCR-based approach that permitted genetic characterization via sequence analysis was applied to raccoon fecal samples (n = 49), collected during 2012-2014. All fecal samples were simultaneously tested with the use of genetic markers, and DNA of microsporidia and Cryptosporidium spp. was detected among the examined raccoons. The results of our research confirmed the presence of Cryptosporidium skunk genotype and Enterocytozoon bieneusi NCF2 genotype. The results suggest a possible role of raccoons in the contamination of the environment, including urban areas, with pathogens of zoonotic significance as well as their role in the transmission and introduction of new genotypes of microparasites in the areas where P. lotor has not been observed yet. To our knowledge, there has been no literature data on the above genotypes detected previously in humans or animals from the examined study sites so far.

"Infectious disease ecology has recently raised its public profile beyond the scientific community due to the major threats that wildlife infections pose to biological conservation, animal welfare, human health and food security. As we start unravelling the full extent of emerging infectious diseases, there is an urgent need to facilitate multidisciplinary research in this area. Even though research in ecology has always had a strong theoretical component, cultural and technical hurdles often hamper direct collaboration between theoreticians and empiricists. Building upon our collective experience of multidisciplinary research and teaching in this area, we propose practical guidelines to help with effective integration among mathematical modelling, fieldwork and laboratory work. Modelling tools can be used at all steps of a field-based research programme, from the formulation of working hypotheses to field study design and data analysis. We illustrate our model-guided fieldwork framework with two case studies we have been conducting on wildlife infectious diseases: plague transmission in prairie dogs and lyssavirus dynamics in American and African bats. These demonstrate that mechanistic models, if properly integrated in research programmes, can provide a framework for holistic approaches to complex biological systems.

"Eco-immunology seeks evolutionary explanations for the tremendous variation in immune defense observed in nature. Assays to quantify immune phenotypes often are crucial to this endeavor. To this end, we suggest that more use could (and arguably should) be made of the veterinary and clinical serological toolbox. For example, measuring the magnitude and half-life of parasite-specific antibodies across a range of host taxa may provide new ways of testing theories in eco-immunology. Here, we suggest that antibody assays developed in veterinary and clinical immunology and epidemiology provide excellent tools--or at least excellent starting points for development of tools--for tests of such hypotheses. We review how such assays work and how they may be optimized for new questions and new systems in eco-immunology. We provide examples of the application of such tools to eco-immunological studies of seabirds and mammals, and suggest a decision-tree to aid development of assays. We expect that addition of such tools to the eco-immunological toolbox will promote progress in the field and help elucidate how immune systems function and why they vary in nature.

"In nature, vector-borne flaviviruses are persistently cycled between either the tick or mosquito vector and small mammals such as rodents, skunks, and swine. These viruses account for considerable human morbidity and mortality worldwide. Increasing and substantial evidence of viral persistence in humans, which includes the isolation of RNA by RT-PCR and infectious virus by culture, continues to be reported. Viral persistence can also be established in vitro in various human, animal, arachnid, and insect cell lines in culture. Although some research has focused on the potential roles of defective virus particles, evasion of the immune response through the manipulation of autophagy and/or apoptosis, the precise mechanism of flavivirus persistence is still not well understood. We propose additional research for further understanding of how viral persistence is established in different systems. Avenues for additional studies include determining whether the multifunctional flavivirus protein NS5 has a role in viral persistence, the development of relevant animal models of viral persistence, and investigating the host responses that allow vector-borne flavivirus replication without detrimental effects on infected cells. Such studies might shed more light on the viral-host relationships and could be used to unravel the mechanisms for establishment of persistence.

"Aims: Seoul orthohantavirus (SEOV) and Leptospira spp. are zoonotic pathogens with rats as main reservoir. Recently, the presence of SEOV in brown rats was reported in one region in the Netherlands. Brown rats are a frequent bycatch in traps placed to catch muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) and coypus (Myocastor coypus), and thus are a potential health risk for trappers. It was our aim to determine the seroprevalence of orthohantavirus, specifically SEOV, and Leptospira spp in Dutch trappers. Methods and results: Participating trappers provided serum samples and completed an online questionnaire. The serum was tested for the presence of antibodies against six orthohantaviruses and eight Leptospira serovars. Two hundred-sixty trappers completed the online questionnaire (65%), and 246 (61%) and 162 (40%) serum samples were tested for relevant orthohantaviruses and Leptospira spp., respectively. The seroprevalence of Puumala orthohantavirus in Dutch trappers was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.1-2.3%). None of the participants tested positive for SEOV. The seroprevalence of leptospirosis was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.3-4.4%), although Leptospira spp. are present in brown rats in the Netherlands.Significance of study: The results indicate that the infections with orthohantaviruses and leptospires is low for muskrat and coypu trappers.

"The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) protein has been shown to play a pivotal role in response to both cytosolic RNA and dsDNA to elicit interferon (IFN) production in mammals. However, the role of duck STING (DuSTING) in antiviral innate immunity, especially in anti-RNA virus infection, has yet to be elucidated. In this study, the function of DuSTING in IFN induction and its role in anti-RNA virus infections were studied. DuSTING was amplified via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from Pekin duck, showing that its cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,149 bp and encodes 382 amino acids (aa). Sequence alignment showed that DuSTING protein shares 71.1, 43.4, and 33.3% identity with chickens, humans, and zebra fish, respectively. Overexpression of DuSTING in duck embryo fibroblasts (DEFs) strongly activated IFN-β promotor activity. Deletion mutant analysis revealed that the first 42 aa containing the first transmembrane (TM) domains and the last 32 aa containing a part of the C-terminal tail (CTT) are essential for its IFN-β activation. In vitro experiments showed that the mRNA levels of DuSTING and IFNs were all upregulated when the DEFs were infected with H9N2 avian influenza virus (AIV) SH010, while overexpression of DuSTING inhibited the replication of this virus. In vivo studies showed that DuSTING mRNA was widely expressed in different tissues, and was up-regulated in the spleen and lung of ducks challenged with SH010. In conclusion, our results indicate that DuSTING is an essential IFN mediator and plays a role in anti-RNA virus innate immunity.

"Metagenomic whole genome sequencing for detection of pathogens in clinical samples is an exciting new area for discovery and clinical testing. A major barrier to this approach is the overwhelming ratio of human to pathogen DNA in samples with low pathogen abundance, which is typical of most clinical specimens. Microbial DNA enrichment methods offer the potential to relieve this limitation by improving this ratio. Two commercially available enrichment kits, the NEBNext Microbiome DNA Enrichment Kit and the Molzym MolYsis Basic kit, were tested for their ability to enrich for microbial DNA from resected arthroplasty component sonicate fluids from prosthetic joint infections or uninfected sonicate fluids spiked with Staphylococcus aureus. Using spiked uninfected sonicate fluid there was a 6-fold enrichment of bacterial DNA with the NEBNext kit and 76-fold enrichment with the MolYsis kit. Metagenomic whole genome sequencing of sonicate fluid revealed 13- to 85-fold enrichment of bacterial DNA using the NEBNext enrichment kit. The MolYsis approach achieved 481- to 9580-fold enrichment, resulting in 7 to 59% of sequencing reads being from the pathogens known to be present in the samples. These results demonstrate the usefulness of these tools when testing clinical samples with low microbial burden using next generation sequencing.

"With one exception (epidemic relapsing fever), borreliae are obligately maintained in nature by ticks. Although some Borrelia spp. may be vertically transmitted to subsequent generations of ticks, most require amplification by a vertebrate host because inheritance is not stable. Enzootic cycles of borreliae have been found globally; those receiving the most attention from researchers are those whose vectors have some degree of anthropophily and, thus, cause zoonoses such as Lyme disease or relapsing fever. To some extent, our views on the synecology of the borreliae has been dominated by an applied focus, viz., analyses that seek to understand the elements of human risk for borreliosis. But, the elements of borrelial perpetuation do not necessarily bear upon risk, nor do our concepts of risk provide the best structure for analyzing perpetuation. We identify the major global themes for the perpetuation of borreliae, and summarize local variations on those themes, focusing on key literature to outline the factors that serve as the basis for the distribution and abundance of borreliae.

"Astroviruses are viral pathogens that have been associated with enteric and neurologic disease in a variety of species. The domestic cat is a prominent host, with reports of astroviral infection being both highly prevalent and widely distributed in the feline population. Despite the potential for inducing significant disease, especially within shelter environments, there is currently only one reliable method of detection: standard reverse-transcription PCR using pan-astrovirus degenerate primers (consensus RT-PCR) with product sequencing. Unfortunately, this process is relatively slow and costly. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) represents an efficient, economical alternative, with the added benefit of viral load quantification. We developed a RT-qPCR assay using probe hybridization technique to detect conserved regions of mamastrovirus 2 extracted from fecal samples of domestic cats. Known positive and negative samples were tested, and results were compared with gold standard consensus RT-PCR and sequencing. A standard curve was employed to determine limits of detection. In order to assess analytic specificity, we tested several additional samples that had been collected from non-felid species and were known to contain non-target astroviruses. Discrepant results between consensus RT-PCR and RT-qPCR testing were further analyzed with a validation RT-PCR assay, using mamastrovirus 2-specific primers. Our probe hybridization RT-qPCR assay is reliable and effective for the detection of mamastrovirus 2. This assay will allow rapid, affordable detection and facilitate further research on astroviral infection within domestic cats.

"The California Arbovirus Surveillance Program was initiated over 50 years ago to track endemic encephalitides and was enhanced in 2000 to include West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans, mosquitoes, sentinel chickens, dead birds and horses. This comprehensive statewide program is a function of strong partnerships among the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), the University of California, and local vector control and public health agencies. This manuscript summarizes WNV surveillance data in California since WNV was first detected in 2003 in southern California. From 2003 through 2018, 6,909 human cases of WNV disease, inclusive of 326 deaths, were reported to CDPH, as well as 730 asymptomatic WNV infections identified during screening of blood and organ donors. Of these, 4,073 (59.0%) were reported as West Nile neuroinvasive disease. California's WNV disease burden comprised 15% of all cases that were reported to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during this time, more than any other state. Additionally, 1,299 equine WNV cases were identified, along with detections of WNV in 23,322 dead birds, 31,695 mosquito pools, and 7,340 sentinel chickens. Annual enzootic detection of WNV typically preceded detection in humans and prompted enhanced intervention to reduce the risk of WNV transmission. Peak WNV activity occurred from July through October in the Central Valley and southern California. Less than five percent of WNV activity occurred in other regions of the state or outside of this time. WNV continues to be a major threat to public and wild avian health in California, particularly in southern California and the Central Valley during summer and early fall months. Local and state public health partners must continue statewide human and mosquito surveillance and facilitate effective mosquito control and bite prevention measures.

"Model organism research is essential for discovering the mechanisms of human diseases by defining biologically meaningful gene to disease relationships. The Rat Genome Database (RGD, ( https://rgd.mcw.edu )) is a cross-species knowledgebase and the premier online resource for rat genetic and physiologic data. This rich resource is enhanced by the inclusion and integration of comparative data for human and mouse, as well as other human disease models including chinchilla, dog, bonobo, pig, 13-lined ground squirrel, green monkey, and naked mole-rat. Functional information has been added to records via the assignment of annotations based on sequence similarity to human, rat, and mouse genes. RGD has also imported well-supported cross-species data from external resources. To enable use of these data, RGD has developed a robust infrastructure of standardized ontologies, data formats, and disease- and species-centric portals, complemented with a suite of innovative tools for discovery and analysis. Using examples of single-gene and polygenic human diseases, we illustrate how data from multiple species can help to identify or confirm a gene as involved in a disease and to identify model organisms that can be studied to understand the pathophysiology of a gene or pathway. The ultimate aim of this report is to demonstrate the utility of RGD not only as the core resource for the rat research community but also as a source of bioinformatic tools to support a wider audience, empowering the search for appropriate models for human afflictions.

"Malignant neoplasms were present in 39/66 Dicrostonyx groenlandicus of varying ages, examined from a laboratory colony. The presence of multiple neoplasms in some resulted in an overall average of 1.15 tumors/affected animal. Gastric squamous papillomas were present in nine, and locally invasive or metastatic gastric squamous cell carcinomas in a further 36 animals. Three mammary adenocarcinomas, one pancreatic islet cell tumor, one probable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and one adrenal cortical adenoma were also seen in lemmings with gastric tumors. Two others had mammary adenocarcinoma alone, and one animal had bilateral Harderian gland adenocarcinoma. Lesions resembling glomerulonephrosis of rats were seen in 23/51 animals whose kidneys were examined. These findings were not considered artefacts of captivity since concurrent gastric squamous cell carcinoma, mammary adenocarcinoma and glomerulonephrosis were present in the single animal examined directly from the wild at Eskimo Point, Northwest Territories.

"Genetic methods available in mice are likely to be powerful tools in dissecting cortical circuits. However, the visual cortex, in which sensory coding has been most thoroughly studied in other species, has essentially been neglected in mice perhaps because of their poor spatial acuity and the lack of columnar organization such as orientation maps. We have now applied quantitative methods to characterize visual receptive fields in mouse primary visual cortex V1 by making extracellular recordings with silicon electrode arrays in anesthetized mice. We used current source density analysis to determine laminar location and spike waveforms to discriminate putative excitatory and inhibitory units. We find that, although the spatial scale of mouse receptive fields is up to one or two orders of magnitude larger, neurons show selectivity for stimulus parameters such as orientation and spatial frequency that is near to that found in other species. Furthermore, typical response properties such as linear versus nonlinear spatial summation (i.e., simple and complex cells) and contrast-invariant tuning are also present in mouse V1 and correlate with laminar position and cell type. Interestingly, we find that putative inhibitory neurons generally have less selective, and nonlinear, responses. This quantitative description of receptive field properties should facilitate the use of mouse visual cortex as a system to address longstanding questions of visual neuroscience and cortical processing.

"Many animals differentially express behaviours across the annual cycle as life stages are coordinated with seasonal environmental conditions. Understanding of the mechanistic basis of such seasonal changes in behaviour has traditionally focused on the role of changes in circulating hormone levels. However, it is increasingly apparent that other endocrine regulation mechanisms such as changes in local hormone synthesis and receptor abundance also play a role. Here I review what is known about seasonal changes in steroid hormone receptor abundance in relation to seasonal behaviour in vertebrates. I find that there is widespread, though not ubiquitous, seasonal variation in the expression of steroid hormone receptors in the brain, with such variation being best documented in association with courtship, mating and aggression. The most common pattern of seasonal variation is for there to be upregulation of sex steroid receptors with the expression of courtship and mating behaviours, when circulating hormone levels are also high. Less well-documented are cases in which seasonal increases in receptor expression could compensate for low circulating hormone levels or seasonal downregulation that could serve a protective function. I conclude by identifying important directions for future research.

"Parasites have a variety of behavioural effects on their hosts, which can in turn affect species with which the host interacts. Here we review how these trait-mediated indirect effects of parasites can alter the outcomes of invader-native interactions, illustrating with examples from the literature and with particular regard to the invader-native crustacean systems studied in our laboratories. Parasites may potentially inhibit or exacerbate invasions via their effects on host behaviour, in addition to their direct virulence effects on hosts. In several crustacean systems, we have found that parasites influence both host predation rates on intra- and inter-guild prey and host vulnerability to being preyed upon. These trait effects can theoretically alter invasion impact and patterns of coexistence, as they indirectly affect interactions between predators and prey with the potential for further ramifications to other species in the food web. The fitness consequences of parasite-induced trait-mediated effects are rarely considered in traditional parasitological contexts, but demand attention in the context of ecological communities. We can regard these trait effects as a form of cryptic virulence that only becomes apparent when hosts are examined in the context of the other species with which they interact.

"The Arctic climate was warmer than today at the last interglacial and the Holocene thermal optimum. To reveal the impact of past climate-warming events on the demographic history of an Arctic specialist, we examined both mitochondrial and nuclear genomic variation in the collared lemming (Dicrostonyx torquatus, Pallas), a keystone species in tundra communities, across its entire distribution in northern Eurasia. The ancestral phylogenetic position of the West Beringian group and divergence time estimates support the hypothesis of continental range contraction to a single refugial area located in West Beringia during high-magnitude warming of the last interglacial, followed by westward recolonization of northern Eurasia in the last glacial period. The West Beringian group harbors the highest mitogenome diversity and its inferred demography indicates a constantly large effective population size over the Late Pleistocene to Holocene. This suggests that northward forest expansion during recent warming of the Holocene thermal optimum did not affect the gene pool of the collared lemming in West Beringia but reduced genomic diversity and effective population size in all other regions of the Eurasian Arctic. Demographic inference from genomic diversity was corroborated by species distribution modeling showing reduction in species distribution during past climate warming. These conclusions are supported by recent paleoecological evidence suggesting smaller temperature increases and moderate northward forest advances in the extreme northeast of Eurasia during the Late Pleistocene-to-Holocene warming events. This study emphasizes the importance of West Beringia as a potential refugium for cold-adapted Arctic species under ongoing climate warming.

"In Britain, the population of native red squirrels Sciurus vulgaris has suffered population declines and local extinctions. Interspecific resource competition and disease spread by the invasive gray squirrel Sciurus carolinensis are the main factors behind the decline. Gray squirrels have adapted to the British landscape so efficiently that they are widely distributed. Knowledge on how gray squirrels are using the landscape matrix and being able to predict their movements will aid management. This study is the first to use global positioning system (GPS) collars on wild gray squirrels to accurately record movements and land cover use within the landscape matrix. This data were used to validate Geographical Information System (GIS) least-cost model predictions of movements and provided much needed information on gray squirrel movement pathways and network use. Buffered least-cost paths and least-cost corridors provide predictions of the most probable movements through the landscape and are seen to perform better than the more expansive least-cost networks which include all possible movements. Applying the knowledge and methodologies gained to current gray squirrel expansion areas, such as Scotland and in Italy, will aid in the prediction of potential movement areas and therefore management of the invasive gray squirrel. The methodologies presented in this study could potentially be used in any landscape and on numerous species.

"Muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) are an integral component of Arctic biodiversity. Given low genetic diversity, their ability to respond to future and rapid Arctic change is unknown, although paleontological history demonstrates adaptability within limits. We discuss status and limitations of current monitoring, and summarize circumpolar status and recent variations, delineating all 55 endemic or translocated populations. Acknowledging uncertainties, global abundance is ca 170 000 muskoxen. Not all populations are thriving. Six populations are in decline, and as recently as the turn of the century, one of these was the largest population in the world, equaling ca 41% of today's total abundance. Climate, diseases, and anthropogenic changes are likely the principal drivers of muskox population change and result in multiple stressors that vary temporally and spatially. Impacts to muskoxen are precipitated by habitat loss/degradation, altered vegetation and species associations, pollution, and harvest. Which elements are relevant for a specific population will vary, as will their cumulative interactions. Our summaries highlight the importance of harmonizing existing data, intensifying long-term monitoring efforts including demographics and health assessments, standardizing and implementing monitoring protocols, and increasing stakeholder engagement/contributions.

"Enveloped viruses enter cells by inducing fusion of viral and cellular membranes, a process catalyzed by a specialized membrane-fusion protein expressed on their surface. This review focuses on recent structural studies of viral fusion proteins with an emphasis on their metastable prefusion form and on interactions with neutralizing antibodies. The fusion glycoproteins have been difficult to study because they are present in a labile, metastable form at the surface of infectious virions. Such metastability is a functional requirement, allowing these proteins to refold into a lower energy conformation while transferring the difference in energy to catalyze the membrane fusion reaction. Structural studies have shown that stable immunogens presenting the same antigenic sites as the labile wild-type proteins efficiently elicit potently neutralizing antibodies, providing a framework with which to engineer the antigens for stability, as well as identifying key vulnerability sites that can be used in next-generation subunit vaccine design.

"A new world of possibilities for ""virus discovery"" was opened up with high-throughput sequencing becoming available in the last decade. While scientifically metagenomic analysis was established before the start of the era of high-throughput sequencing, the availability of the first second-generation sequencers was the kick-off for diagnosticians to use sequencing for the detection of novel pathogens. Today, diagnostic metagenomics is becoming the standard procedure for the detection and genetic characterization of new viruses or novel virus variants. Here, we provide an overview about technical considerations of high-throughput sequencing-based diagnostic metagenomics together with selected examples of ""virus discovery"" for animal diseases or zoonoses and metagenomics for food safety or basic veterinary research.

"KEY POINTS: The lateral posterior and posterior thalamic nuclei have been implicated in aspects of visually guided behaviour and reflex responses to light, including those dependent on melanopsin photoreception. Here we investigated the extent and basic properties of visually evoked activity across the mouse lateral posterior and posterior thalamus. We show that a subset of retinal projections to these regions derive from melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells and find many cells that exhibit melanopsin-dependent changes in firing. We also show that subsets of cells across these regions integrate signals from both eyes in various ways and that, within the lateral posterior thalamus, visual responses are retinotopically ordered. ABSTRACT: In addition to the primary thalamocortical visual relay in the lateral geniculate nuclei, a number of other thalamic regions contribute to aspects of visual processing. Thus, the lateral posterior thalamic nuclei (LP/pulvinar) appear important for various functions including determining visual saliency, visually guided behaviours and, alongside dorsal portions of the posterior thalamic nuclei (Po), multisensory processing of information related to aversive stimuli. However, despite the growing importance of mice as a model for understanding visual system organisation, at present we know very little about the basic visual response properties of cells in the mouse LP or Po. Prompted by earlier suggestions that melanopsin photoreception might be important for certain functions of these nuclei, we first employ specific viral tracing to show that a subset of retinal projections to the LP derive from melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells. We next use multielectrode electrophysiology to demonstrate that LP and dorsal Po cells exhibit a variety of responses to simple visual stimuli including two distinct classes that express melanopsin-dependent changes in firing (together comprising ∼25% of neurons we recorded). We also show that subgroups of LP/Po cells integrate signals from both eyes in various ways and that, within the LP, visual responses are retinotopically ordered. Together our data reveal a diverse population of visually responsive neurons across the LP and dorsal Po whose properties align with some of the established functions of these nuclei and suggest new possible routes through which melanopsin photoreception could contribute to reflex light responses and/or higher order visual processing.

"Many rodents, including most populations of arctic lemmings (genus Dicrostonyx and Lemmus), have cyclic population dynamics. Among the numerous hypotheses which have been proposed and tested to explain this typical characteristic of some terrestrial vertebrate communities, trophic interactions have often been presented as the most likely drivers of these periodic fluctuations. The possible role of parasites has, however, only seldom been assessed. In this study, we genetically measured the prevalence of two endoparasite taxa, eimerians and cestodes, in 372 faecal samples from collared lemmings, over a five year period and across three distant sites in Northeast Greenland. Prevalence of cestodes was low (2.7% over all sites and years) and this taxon was only found at one site (although in 4 out of 5 years) in adult hosts. By contrast, we found high prevalence for eimerians (77.7% over all sites and years), which occurred at all sites, in every year, for both age classes (at the Hochstetter Forland site where both adult and juvenile faeces were collected) and regardless of reproductive and social status inferred from the characteristics of the lemming nests where the samples had been collected. Prevalence of eimerians significantly varied among years (not among sites) and was higher for juvenile than for adult lemmings at the Hochstetter Forland site. However, higher prevalence of eimerians (P (t) ) was only associated with lower lemming density (N (t) ) at one of the three sites and we found no delayed density dependence between N (t) and P (t+1) to support the parasite hypothesis. Our results show that there is no clear relation between lemming density and eimerian faecal prevalence in Northeast Greenland and hence no evidence that eimerians could be driving the cyclic population dynamics of collared lemmings in this region.

"Sex steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol and exert pleiotropic effects notably in the central nervous system. Pioneering studies from Baulieu and colleagues have suggested that steroids are also locally-synthesized in the brain. Such steroids, called neurosteroids, can rapidly modulate neuronal excitability and functions, brain plasticity, and behavior. Accumulating data obtained on a wide variety of species demonstrate that neurosteroidogenesis is an evolutionary conserved feature across fish, birds, and mammals. In this review, we will first document neurosteroidogenesis and steroid signaling for estrogens, progestagens, and androgens in the brain of teleost fish, birds, and mammals. We will next consider the effects of sex steroids in homeostatic and regenerative neurogenesis, in neuroprotection, and in sexual behaviors. In a last part, we will discuss the transport of steroids and lipoproteins from the periphery within the brain (and vice-versa) and document their effects on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and on neuroprotection. We will emphasize the potential interaction between lipoproteins and sex steroids, addressing the beneficial effects of steroids and lipoproteins, particularly HDL-cholesterol, against the breakdown of the BBB reported to occur during brain ischemic stroke. We will consequently highlight the potential anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and neuroprotective properties of sex steroid and lipoproteins, these latest improving cholesterol and steroid ester transport within the brain after insults.

"Genetically modified stem and progenitor cells have emerged as a promising regenerative platform in the treatment of genetic and degenerative disorders, highlighted by their successful therapeutic use in inherent immunodeficiencies. However, biosafety concerns over insertional mutagenesis resulting from integrating recombinant viral vectors have overshadowed the widespread clinical applications of genetically modified stem cells. Here, we report an RNA-based episomal vector system, amenable for long-term transgene expression in stem cells. Specifically, we used a unique intranuclear RNA virus, borna disease virus (BDV), as the gene transfer vehicle, capable of persistent infections in various cell types. BDV-based vectors allowed for long-term transgene expression in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) without affecting cellular morphology, cell surface CD105 expression or the adipogenicity of MSCs. Similarly, replication-defective BDV vectors achieved long-term transduction of human induced pluripotent stem cells, while maintaining the ability to differentiate into three embryonic germ layers. Thus, the BDV-based vectors offer a genomic modification-free, episomal RNA delivery system for sustained stem cell transduction.

"In veterinary and human medicine, gabapentin (a chemical analog of γ-aminobutyric acid) is commonly prescribed to treat postoperative and chronic neuropathic pain. This study explored the pharmacokinetics of oral and subcutaneous administration of gabapentin at high (80 mg/kg) and low (30 mg/kg) doses as a potential analgesic in black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus; n = 24). The doses (30 and 80 mg/kg) and half maximal effective concentration (1.4 to 16.7 ng/mL) for this study were extrapolated from pharmacokinetic efficacy studies in rats, rabbits, and cats. Gabapentin in plasma was measured by using an immunoassay, and data were evaluated using noncompartmental analysis. The peak plasma concentrations (mean ±1 SD) were 42.6 ±14.8 and 115.5 ±15.2 ng/mL, respectively, after 30 and 80 mg/kg SC and 14.5 ±3.5 and 20.7 ±6.1 ng/mL after the low and high oral dosages, respectively. All peak plasma concentrations of gabapentin occurred within 5 h of administration. Disappearance half-lives for the low and high oral doses were 7.4 ± 6.0 h and 5.0 ± 0.8 h, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that oral administration of gabapentin at low (30 mg/kg) doses likely would achieve and maintain plasma concentrations at half maximum effective concentration for 12 h, making it a viable option for an every 12-h treatment.

"Higher-order visual thalamus communicates broadly and bi-directionally with primary and extrastriate cortical areas in various mammals. In primates, the pulvinar is a topographically and functionally organized thalamic nucleus that is largely dedicated to visual processing. Still, a more granular connectivity map is needed to understand the role of thalamocortical loops in visually guided behavior. Similarly, the secondary visual thalamic nucleus in mice (the lateral posterior nucleus, LP) has extensive connections with cortex. To resolve the precise connectivity of these circuits, we first mapped mouse visual cortical areas using intrinsic signal optical imaging and then injected fluorescently tagged retrograde tracers (cholera toxin subunit B) into retinotopically-matched locations in various combinations of seven different visual areas. We find that LP neurons representing matched regions in visual space but projecting to different extrastriate areas are found in different topographically organized zones, with few double-labeled cells (~4-6%). In addition, V1 and extrastriate visual areas received input from the ventrolateral part of the laterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (LDVL). These observations indicate that the thalamus provides topographically organized circuits to each mouse visual area and raise new questions about the contributions from LP and LDVL to cortical activity.

"Cancer is a disease of multicellularity; it originates when cells become dysregulated due to mutations and grow out of control, invading other tissues and provoking discomfort, disability, and eventually death. Human life expectancy has greatly increased in the last two centuries, and consequently so has the incidence of cancer. However, how cancer patterns in humans compare to those of other species remains largely unknown. In this review, we search for clues about cancer and its evolutionary underpinnings across the tree of life. We discuss data from a wide range of species, drawing comparisons with humans when adequate, and interpret our findings from an evolutionary perspective. We conclude that certain cancers are uniquely common in humans, such as lung, prostate, and testicular cancer; while others are common across many species. Lymphomas appear in almost every animal analysed, including in young animals, which may be related to pathogens imposing selection on the immune system. Cancers unique to humans may be due to our modern environment or may be evolutionary accidents: random events in the evolution of our species. Finally, we find that cancer-resistant animals such as whales and mole-rats have evolved cellular mechanisms that help them avoid neoplasia, and we argue that there are multiple natural routes to cancer resistance.

"BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), acting as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) have been reported to regulate the expression of targeted genes by sponging miRNA in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). METHODS: However, their potential implications for recurrence free survival prognosis and functional roles remains largely unclear in COAD. In this study, we downloaded the TCGA dataset (training dataset) and GSE39582 (validation dataset) of COAD patients with prognostic information. RESULTS: A total of 411 differentially expressed genes (DElncRNAs: 12 downregulated and 43 upregulated), 18 DE miRNAs (9 downregulated and 9 upregulated) and 338 DEmRNAs (113 downregulated and 225 upregulated) were identified in recurrence samples compared with non-recurrence samples with the thresholds of FDR < 0.05 and |log(2)FC|> 0.263. Based on six signature lncRNAs (LINC00899, LINC01503, PRKAG2-AS1, RAD21-AS1, SRRM2-AS1 and USP30-AS1), the risk score (RS) system was constructed. Two prognostic clinical features, including pathologic stage and RS model status were screened for building the nomogram survival model. Moreover, a recurrent-specific ceRNA network was successfully constructed with 2 signature lncRNAs, 4 miRNAs and 113 mRNAs. Furthermore, we further manifested that SRRM2-AS1 predicted a poor prognosis in COAD patients. Furthermore, knockdown of SRRM2-AS1 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT markers in HT-29 and SW1116 cells. CONCLUSION: These identified novel lncRNA signature and ceRNA network associated with recurrence prognosis might provide promising therapeutic targets for COAD patients.

"Light plays an important role in the growth and differentiation of Lentinula edodes mycelia, and mycelial morphology is influenced by light wavelengths. The blue light-induced formation of brown film on the vegetative mycelial tissues of L. edodes is an important process. However, the mechanisms of L. edodes' brown film formation, as induced by blue light, are still unclear. Using a high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry integrated with a highly sensitive immune-affinity antibody method, phosphoproteomes of L. edodes mycelia under red- and blue-light conditions were analyzed. A total of 11,224 phosphorylation sites were identified on 2,786 proteins, of which 9,243 sites on 2,579 proteins contained quantitative information. In total, 475 sites were up-regulated and 349 sites were down-regulated in the blue vs red group. To characterize the differentially phosphorylated proteins, systematic bioinformatics analyses, including gene ontology annotations, domain annotations, subcellular localizations, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway annotations, were performed. These differentially phosphorylated proteins were correlated with light signal transduction, cell wall degradation, and melanogenesis, suggesting that these processes are involved in the formation of the brown film. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the blue light-induced brown film formation at the post-translational modification level.

"Humanity could not survive without a reliably clean, safe, and steady flow of drinking water. Since the early 1900s when typhoid fever and cholera were frequently causes of waterborne illness in developed countries, drinking water supplies have been protected and treated to ensure water safety, quality, and quantity. Having access to safe drinking water has always been one of the cornerstones of good public health. Not only safe water is limited to drinking water, but recreational water can also be a source for waterborne illness—both from treated waters such as in swimming pools, whirlpools, or splash pads and from non-treated surface waters such as lakes, rivers, streams and ponds. Recreational waters may cause illness not only from ingestion of pathogens, but also when in contact with eyes, ears, or skin. Some pathogens in water can be acquired by inhalation of aerosols from water that is agitated or sprayed such as in humidifiers, fountains, or misting of produce. This poses a potential risk to those exposed, particularly if they are immunocompromised.

"Leishmania parasites are a group of kinetoplastid pathogens that cause a variety of clinical disorders while maintaining cell communication by secreting extracellular vesicles. Emerging technologies have been adapted for the study of Leishmania-host cell interactions, to enable the broad-scale analysis of the extracellular vesicles of this parasite. Leishmania extracellular vesicles (LEVs) are spheroidal nanoparticles of polydispersed suspensions surrounded by a layer of lipid membrane. Although LEVs have attracted increasing attention from researchers, many aspects of their biology remain unclear, including their bioavailability and function in the complex molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis. Given the importance of LEVs in the parasite-host interaction, and in the parasite-parasite relationships that have emerged during the evolutionary history of these organisms, the present review provides an overview of the available data on Leishmania, and formulates guidelines for LEV research. We conclude by reporting direct methods for the isolation of specific LEVs from the culture supernatant of the promastigotes and amastigotes that are suitable for a range of different downstream applications, which increases the compatibility and reproducibility of the approach for the establishment of optimal and comparable isolation conditions and the complete characterization of the LEV, as well as the critical immunomodulatory events triggered by this important group of parasites.

"The only vaccine ever approved for human tuberculosis was developed a century ago from an isolate of Mycobacterium bovis derived from a tuberculous cow. Initial safety and efficacy studies of an attenuated version of this isolate were conducted in cattle and other animals. In 1921 the first human, an infant, was orally dosed with this attenuated strain that came to be known as M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG); named for Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin, the two French scientists that developed the strain. Since 1921, billions of people have been vaccinated with BCG making it the oldest, most widely used, and safest vaccine in use today. It is also the tuberculosis vaccine most studied for use in wildlife, including deer. While BCG vaccination of deer may not reliably prevent infection, it consistently decreases lesion severity, minimizing large, necrotic lesions, which often contain large numbers of bacilli. It is believed that decreased lesion severity correlates with decreased disease transmission; however, this hypothesis remains to be proven. Safety studies in white-tailed deer show BCG may persist in lymphoid tissues for up to 12 months; a factor to be considered in deer used for food. Beyond efficacy and safety, methods of vaccine delivery to free-ranging deer are also under investigation, both in the laboratory and in the field. The ideal delivery method is effective, efficient and safe for non-target species, including livestock. Ingestion of BCG by cattle is of special concern as such cattle may present as ""false positives"" using currently approved diagnostic methods, thus interfering with efforts by animal health agencies to monitor cattle for tuberculosis. An effective BCG vaccine for deer would be of value in regions where free-ranging deer represent a potential source of M. bovis for livestock. Such a vaccine would also be beneficial to farmed deer where M. bovis represents a serious threat to trade and productivity.

"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has become a widely used technology that can accurately detect individual pathogens. This prospective study was performed between February 2019 and September 2019 in one of the largest clinical neurosurgery centers in China. The study aimed to evaluate the performance of mNGS on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from neurosurgical patients for the diagnosis of external ventricular and lumbar drainage (EVD/LD)-associated ventriculitis and meningitis (VM). We collected CSF specimens from neurosurgical patients with EVD/LD for more than 24 h to perform conventional microbiological studies and mNGS analyses in a pairwise manner. We also investigated the usefulness of mNGS of CSF for the diagnosis of EVD/LD-associated VM. In total, 102 patients were enrolled in this study and divided into three groups, including confirmed VM (cVM) (39), suspected VM (sVM) (49), and non-VM (nVM) (14) groups. Of all the patients, mNGS detected 21 Gram-positive bacteria, 20 Gram-negative bacteria, and five fungi. The three primary bacteria detected were Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), Acinetobacter baumannii (5), and Staphylococcus aureus (3). The mNGS-positive coincidence rate of confirmed EVD/LD-associated VM was 61.54% (24/39), and the negative coincidence rate of the nVM group was 100% (14/14). Of 15 VM pathogens not identified by mNGS in the cVM group, eight were negative with mNGS and seven were inconsistent with the conventional microbiological identification results. In addition, mNGS identified pathogens in 22 cases that were negative using conventional methods; of them, 10 patients received a favorable clinical treatment; thus, showing the benefit of mNGS-guided therapy.

"The bacterial genus, Borrelia, is comprised of vector-borne spirochete species that infect and are transmitted from multiple host species. Some Borrelia species cause highly-prevalent diseases in humans and domestic animals. Evolutionary, ecological, and molecular research on many Borrelia species have resulted in tremendous progress toward understanding the biology and natural history of these species. Yet, many outstanding questions, such as how Borrelia populations will be impacted by climate and land-use change, will require an interdisciplinary approach. The evolutionary ecology research framework incorporates theory and data from evolutionary, ecological, and molecular studies while overcoming common assumptions within each field that can hinder integration across these disciplines. Evolutionary ecology offers a framework to evaluate the ecological consequences of evolved traits and to predict how present-day ecological processes may result in further evolutionary change. Studies of microbes with complex transmission cycles, like Borrelia, which interact with multiple vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors, are poised to leverage the power of the evolutionary ecology framework to identify the molecular interactions involved in ecological processes that result in evolutionary change. Using existing data, we outline how evolutionary ecology theory can delineate how interactions with other species and the physical environment create selective forces or impact migration of Borrelia populations and result in micro-evolutionary changes. We further discuss the ecological and molecular consequences of those micro-evolutionary changes. While many of the currently outstanding questions will necessitate new experimental designs and additional empirical data, many others can be addressed immediately by integrating existing molecular and ecological data within an evolutionary ecology framework.

"Although freshwater invasions have not been targeted for maintenance management or eradication as often as terrestrial invasions have, attempts to do so are frequent. Failures as well as successes abound, but several methods have been improved and new approaches are on the horizon. Many freshwater fish and plant invaders have been eliminated, especially by chemical and physical methods for fishes and herbicides for plants. Efforts to maintain invasive freshwater fishes at low levels have sometimes succeeded, although continuing the effort has proven challenging. By contrast, successful maintenance management of invasive freshwater plants is uncommon, although populations of several species have been managed by biological control. Invasive crayfish populations have rarely been controlled for long. Marine invasions have proven far less tractable than those in fresh water, with a few striking eradications of species detected before they had spread widely, and no marine invasions have been substantially managed for long at low levels. The rapid development of technologies based on genetics has engendered excitement about possibly eradicating or controlling terrestrial invaders, and such technologies may also prove useful for certain aquatic invaders. Methods of particular interest, alone or in various combinations, are gene-silencing, RNA-guided gene drives, and the use of transgenes.

"Autoimmune encephalitis causes subacute deficits of memory and cognition, often followed by suppressed level of consciousness or coma. A careful history and examination may show early clues to particular autoimmune causes, such as neuromyotonia, hyperekplexia, psychosis, dystonia, or the presence of particular tumors. Ancillary testing with MRI and EEG may be helpful for excluding other causes, managing seizures, and, rarely, for identifying characteristic findings. Appropriate autoantibody testing can confirm specific diagnoses, although this is often done in parallel with exclusion of infectious and other causes. Autoimmune encephalitis may be divided into several groups of diseases: those with pathogenic antibodies to cell surface proteins, those with antibodies to intracellular synaptic proteins, T-cell diseases associated with antibodies to intracellular antigens, and those associated with other autoimmune disorders. Many forms of autoimmune encephalitis are paraneoplastic, and each of these conveys a distinct risk profile for various tumors. Tumor screening and, if necessary, treatment is essential to proper management. Most forms of autoimmune encephalitis respond to immune therapies, although powerful immune suppression for weeks or months may be needed in difficult cases. Autoimmune encephalitis may relapse, so follow-up care is important.

"Because of their agricultural value, there is a great body of research dedicated to understanding the microorganisms responsible for rumen carbon degradation. However, we lack a holistic view of the microbial food web responsible for carbon processing in this ecosystem. Here, we sampled rumen-fistulated moose, allowing access to rumen microbial communities actively degrading woody plant biomass in real time. We resolved 1,193 viral contigs and 77 unique, near-complete microbial metagenome-assembled genomes, many of which lacked previous metabolic insights. Plant-derived metabolites were measured with NMR and carbohydrate microarrays to quantify the carbon nutrient landscape. Network analyses directly linked measured metabolites to expressed proteins from these unique metagenome-assembled genomes, revealing a genome-resolved three-tiered carbohydrate-fuelled trophic system. This provided a glimpse into microbial specialization into functional guilds defined by specific metabolites. To validate our proteomic inferences, the catalytic activity of a polysaccharide utilization locus from a highly connected metabolic hub genome was confirmed using heterologous gene expression. Viral detected proteins and linkages to microbial hosts demonstrated that phage are active controllers of rumen ecosystem function. Our findings elucidate the microbial and viral members, as well as their metabolic interdependencies, that support in situ carbon degradation in the rumen ecosystem.

"BACKGROUND: Current estimates suggest that even in the most resourced settings, the aetiology of encephalitis is identified in less than half of clinical cases. It is acknowledged that filling this gap needs a combination of rigorous sampling and improved diagnostic technologies. Next generation sequencing (NGS) methods are powerful tools with the potential for comprehensive and unbiased detection of pathogens in clinical samples. We reviewed the use of this new technology for the diagnosis of suspected infectious encephalitis, and discuss the feasibility for introduction of NGS methods as a frontline diagnostic test. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed, using MESH and text word searches for variants of ""sequencing"" and ""encephalitis"" in Medline and EMbase, and searching bibliographies and citations using the Web of Science database. Two authors independently reviewed, extracted and summarised data. FINDINGS: The review identified 25 articles reporting 44 case reports of patients with suspected encephalitis for whom NGS was used as a diagnostic tool. We present the data and highlight themes arising from these cases. There are no randomly controlled trials to assess the utility of NGS as a diagnostic tool. INTERPRETATION: There is increasing evidence of a role for NGS in the work-up of undiagnosed encephalitis. Lower costs and increasing accessibility of these technologies will facilitate larger studies of these patients. We recommend NGS should be considered as a front-line diagnostic test in chronic and recurring presentations and, given current sample-to-result turn-around times, as second-line in acute cases of encephalitis.

"If validated beforehand, the analysis of dried blood on blotting paper (BP samples) is very useful for monitoring free-ranging animals. We aimed to validate this method for the detection of antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii in stray cats. We used the modified agglutination test (MAT) in 199 sample pairs of sera and BP samples from 54, 39, 56, and 50 cats trapped during four periods in five dairy farms. Screening was at 1:6, 1:12, and 1:24 dilutions. The cut-off value was at MAT titre ≥ 24, but MAT titre ≥ 12 was also considered for BP samples that often have a higher dilution level. Depending on the period, sample type, and cut-off value, sensitivity of the analysis of the BP sample vs. serum varied from 87.1% to 100% and specificity ranged from 72.22% to 100%. The concordance values and Kappa coefficient showed a substantial to excellent agreement between the results of the two methods, whatever the cut-off value. These findings quantifiably validate the use of MAT on BP samples for the detection of antibodies to T. gondii in stray cats, but we recommend expressing results from BP samples with several cut-off values as the MAT titres tend to be lower than those of sera.

"Environmental waters are monitored for fecal pollution to protect public health and water resources. Traditionally, general fecal-indicator bacteria are used; however, they cannot distinguish human fecal waste from other animal pollution sources. Recently, a novel bacteriophage, crAssphage, was discovered by metagenomic data mining and reported to be abundant in and closely associated with human fecal waste. To confirm bioinformatic predictions, 384 primer sets were designed along the length of the crAssphage genome. Based on initial screening, two novel crAssphage qPCR assays (CPQ_056 and CPQ_064) were designed and evaluated in reference fecal samples and water matrices. The assays exhibited high specificities (98.6%) when tested against an animal fecal reference library, and crAssphage genetic markers were highly abundant in raw sewage and sewage-impacted water samples. In addition, CPQ_056 and CPQ_064 performance was compared to HF183/BacR287 and HumM2 assays in paired experiments. Findings confirm that viral crAssphage qPCR assays perform at a similar level to well-established bacterial human-associated fecal-source-identification approaches. These new viral-based assays could become important water quality management and research tools.

"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized multiple areas in the field of infectious diseases, from pathogen discovery to characterization of genes mediating drug resistance. Consequently, there is much anticipation that NGS technologies may be harnessed in the realm of diagnostic methods to complement or replace current culture-based and molecular microbiologic techniques. In this context, much consideration has been given to hypothesis-free, culture-independent tests that can be performed directly on primary clinical samples. The closest realizations of such universal diagnostic methods achieved to date are based on targeted amplicon and unbiased metagenomic shotgun NGS approaches. Depending on the exact details of implementation and analysis, these approaches have the potential to detect viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, and archaea, including organisms that were previously undiscovered and those that are uncultivatable. Shotgun metagenomics approaches additionally can provide information on the presence of virulence and resistance genetic elements. While many limitations to the use of NGS in clinical microbiology laboratories are being overcome with decreasing technology costs, expanding curated pathogen sequence databases, and better data analysis tools, there remain many challenges to the routine use and implementation of these methods. This review summarizes recent advances in applications of targeted amplicon and shotgun-based metagenomics approaches to infectious disease diagnostic methods. Technical and conceptual challenges are considered, along with expectations for future applications of these techniques.

"Since its recent discovery, Bourbon virus has been isolated from a human and ticks. To assess exposure of potential vertebrate reservoirs, we assayed banked serum and plasma samples from wildlife and domestic animals in Missouri, USA, for Bourbon virus-neutralizing antibodies. We detected high seroprevalence in raccoons (50%) and white-tailed deer (86%).

"Humans create ecologically simplified landscapes that favour some wildlife species, but not others. Here, we explore the possibility that those species that tolerate or do well in human-modified environments, or 'synanthropic' species, are predominantly the hosts of zoonotic emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). We do this using global wildlife conservation data and wildlife host information extracted from systematically reviewed emerging infectious disease literature. The evidence for this relationship is examined with special emphasis on the Australasian, South East Asian and East Asian regions. We find that synanthropic wildlife hosts are approximately 15 times more likely than other wildlife in this region to be the source of emerging infectious diseases, and this association is essentially independent of the taxonomy of the species. A significant positive association with EIDs is also evident for those wildlife species of low conservation risk. Since the increase and spread of native and introduced species able to adapt to human-induced landscape change is at the expense of those species most vulnerable to habitat loss, our findings suggest a mechanism linking land conversion, global decline in biodiversity and a rise in EIDs of wildlife origin.

"The IKK-NF-κB signaling cascade is one of the crucial responsive mechanisms in inflammatory and immune responses. The key kinase proteins called inhibitor of kappa B kinases (IKKs) serve as the core elements involved in cascade activation. Here, the complete ORFs of IKK homologs, PmIKK β, PmIKK ε 1, and PmIKK ε 2, from the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon were identified and characterized for their functions in shrimp antiviral responses. The PmIKK transcripts were widely expressed in various examined tissues and the PmIKKε protein was detected in all three types of shrimp hemocytes. Only the PmIKK ε 1 and PmIKK ε 2 were responsive to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), yellow head virus (YHV) and a bacterium Vibrio harveyi infection, while the PmIKK β exhibited no significant response to pathogen infection. On the contrary, suppression of PmIKK β and PmIKK ε by dsRNA-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a rapid death of WSSV-infected shrimp and the significant reduction of an IFN-like PmVago4 transcript. Whereas, the mRNA levels of the antimicrobial peptides, ALFPm3 and CrustinPm5, and a transcription factor, PmDorsal were significantly increased, those of ALFPm6, CrustinPm1, CrustinPm7, PmVago1, PmRelish, and PmCactus were unaffected. Overexpression of PmIKKβ and PmIKKε in HEK293T cells differentially activated the NF-κB and IFNβ promoter activities, respectively. These results suggest that the PmIKKβ and PmIKKε may act as common factors regulating the expression of immune-related genes from various signaling pathways. Interestingly, the PmIKKs may also contribute a possible role in shrimp cytokine-like system and cross-talking between signaling transductions in innate immune responses.

"A growing body of literature offers a framework for understanding geographic and ecological distributions of species; a few applications of this framework have treated disease transmission systems and their geography. The general framework focuses on interactions among abiotic requirements, biotic constraints, and dispersal abilities of species as determinants of distributional areas. Disease transmission systems have key differences from other sorts of biological phenomena: Interactions among species are particularly important, interactions may be stable or unstable, abiotic conditions may be relatively less important in shaping disease distributions, and dispersal abilities may be quite variable. The ways in which these differences may influence disease transmission geography are complex; I illustrate their effects by means of worked examples regarding West Nile Virus, plague, filoviruses, and yellow fever.

"Plague impacts prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.), the endangered black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) and other sensitive wildlife species. We compared efficacy of prophylactic treatments (burrow dusting with deltamethrin or oral vaccination with recombinant ""sylvatic plague vaccine"" [RCN-F1/V307]) to placebo treatment in black-tailed prairie dog (C. ludovicianus) colonies. Between 2013 and 2015, we measured prairie dog apparent survival, burrow activity and flea abundance on triplicate plots (""blocks"") receiving dust, vaccine or placebo treatment. Epizootic plague affected all three blocks but emerged asynchronously. Dust plots had fewer fleas per burrow (P < 0.0001), and prairie dogs captured on dust plots had fewer fleas (P < 0.0001) than those on vaccine or placebo plots. Burrow activity and prairie dog density declined sharply in placebo plots when epizootic plague emerged. Patterns in corresponding dust and vaccine plots were less consistent and appeared strongly influenced by timing of treatment applications relative to plague emergence. Deltamethrin or oral vaccination enhanced apparent survival within two blocks. Applying insecticide or vaccine prior to epizootic emergence blunted effects of plague on prairie dog survival and abundance, thereby preventing colony collapse. Successful plague mitigation will likely entail strategic combined uses of burrow dusting and oral vaccination within large colonies or colony complexes.

"Evolutionary principles are now routinely incorporated into medicine and agriculture. Examples include the design of treatments that slow the evolution of resistance by weeds, pests, and pathogens, and the design of breeding programs that maximize crop yield or quality. Evolutionary principles are also increasingly incorporated into conservation biology, natural resource management, and environmental science. Examples include the protection of small and isolated populations from inbreeding depression, the identification of key traits involved in adaptation to climate change, the design of harvesting regimes that minimize unwanted life-history evolution, and the setting of conservation priorities based on populations, species, or communities that harbor the greatest evolutionary diversity and potential. The adoption of evolutionary principles has proceeded somewhat independently in these different fields, even though the underlying fundamental concepts are the same. We explore these fundamental concepts under four main themes: variation, selection, connectivity, and eco-evolutionary dynamics. Within each theme, we present several key evolutionary principles and illustrate their use in addressing applied problems. We hope that the resulting primer of evolutionary concepts and their practical utility helps to advance a unified multidisciplinary field of applied evolutionary biology.

"Land use influences disease emergence by changing the ecological dynamics of humans, wildlife, domestic animals, and pathogens. This is a central tenet of One Health, and one that is gaining momentum in wildlife management decision-making in the United States. Using almost 2000 serological samples collected from non-native wild pigs (Sus scrofa) throughout Florida (U.S.), we compared the prevalence and exposure risk of two directly transmitted pathogens, pseudorabies virus (PrV) and Brucella spp., to test the hypothesis that disease emergence would be positively correlated with one of the most basic wildlife management operations: Hunting. The seroprevalence of PrV-Brucella spp. coinfection or PrV alone was higher for wild pigs in land management areas that allowed hunting with dogs than in areas that culled animals using other harvest methods. This pattern did not hold for Brucella alone. The likelihood of exposure to PrV, but not Brucella spp., was also significantly higher among wild pigs at hunted sites than at sites where animals were culled. By failing to consider the impact of dog hunting on the emergence of non-native pathogens, current animal management practices have the potential to affect public health, the commercial livestock industry, and wildlife conservation.

"Ecological perturbations caused by biotic invasion have been identified as a growing threat to global sustainability. Invasive alien plants species (IAPS) are considered to be one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and thereby altering the ecosystem services and socio-economic conditions through different mechanisms. Although the ecological impacts of IAPS are well documented, there is a dearth of studies regarding their economic quantification, livelihood considerations, biotechnological prospects (phytoremediation, bioenergy, phyto-synthesis of nanoparticles, biomedical, industrial applications etc.) and human health risk assessments of IAPS. In this context, the current panoramic review aimed to investigate the environmental, socio-ecological and health risks posed by IAPS as well as the compounded impact of IAPS with habitat fragmentation, climate and land use changes. To this end, the need of an integrated trans-disciplinary research is emphasized for the sustainable management of IAPS. The management prospects can be further strengthened through their linkage with geo-spatial technologies (remote sensing and GIS) by mapping and monitoring the IAPS spread. Further, the horizon of IAPS management is expanded to ecological indicator perspectives of IAPS, biosecurity, and risk assessment protocols with critical discussion. Moreover, positive as well as negative implications of the IAPS on environment, health, ecosystem services and socio-economy (livelihood) are listed so that a judicious policy framework could be developed for the IAPS management in order to mitigate the human health implications.

"Group A rotaviruses (RVA) are a major cause of viral diarrhea in the young of mammals and birds. RVA strains with certain genotype constellations or VP7-VP4 (G-P) genotype combinations are commonly found in a particular host species, whilst unusual or exotic RVAs have also been reported. In most cases, these exotic rotaviruses are derived from RVA strains common to other host species, possibly through interspecies transmission coupled with reassortment events, whilst a few other strains exhibit novel genotypes/genetic constellations rarely found in other RVAs. The epidemiology and evolutionary patterns of exotic rotaviruses in humans have been thoroughly reviewed previously. On the other hand, there is no comprehensive review article devoted to exotic rotaviruses in domestic animals and birds so far. The present review focuses on the exotic/unusual rotaviruses detected in livestock (cattle and pigs), horses and companion animals (cats and dogs). Avian rotaviruses (group D, group F and group G strains), including RVAs, which are genetically divergent from mammalian RVAs, are also discussed. Although scattered and limited studies have reported rotaviruses in several exotic animals and birds, including wildlife, these data remain to be reviewed. Therefore, a section entitled ""rotaviruses in exotic animals"" was included in the present review.

"Bat-associated bartonellae, including Bartonella mayotimonensis and Candidatus Bartonella rousetti, were recently identified as emerging and potential zoonotic agents, respectively. However, there is no report of bat-associated bartonellae in Zambia. Thus, we aimed to isolate and characterize Bartonella spp. from bats and bat flies captured in Zambia by culturing and PCR. Overall, Bartonella spp. were isolated from six out of 36 bats (16.7%), while Bartonella DNA was detected in nine out of 19 bat flies (47.3%). Subsequent characterization using a sequence of five different genes revealed that three isolates obtained from Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) were Ca. B. rousetti. The isolates obtained from insectivorous bats (Macronycteris vittatus) were divided into two previously unclassified bat-associated bartonellae. A phylogenetic analysis of the six genotypes of Bartonella gltA sequences from nine pathogen-positive bat flies revealed that three genotypes belonged to the same clades as bat-associated bartonellae, including Ca. B. rousetti. The other three genotypes represented arthropod-associated bartonellae, which have previously been isolated only from ectoparasites. We demonstrated that Ca. B. rousetti is maintained between bats (R. aegyptiacus) and bat flies in Zambia. Continuous surveillance of Bartonella spp. in bats and serological surveys in humans in Africa are warranted to evaluate the public health importance of bat-associated bartonellae.

"The uneven standards of surveillance, human- or animal-based, for zoonotic diseases or pathogens maintained and transmitted by wildlife H(R)s, or even domestic species, is a global problem, readily apparent even within the United States, where investment in public health, including surveillance systems, has a long and enviable history. As of 2006, there appears to be little scientific, social, or political consensus that animal-based surveillance for zoonoses merits investment in international infrastructure, other than the fledgling efforts with avian influenza, or targeted nontraditional avenues of surveillance and research. National institutions charged with strategic planning for emerging diseases or intentional releases of zoonotic agents have emphasized improving diagnostic capabilities for detecting human infections, modifying the immune status of human or domestic animals through vaccines, producing better antiviral or antibacterial drugs, and enhancing human-based surveillance as an early warning system. With the possible exception of extensive human vaccination, each of these approaches target post-spillover events and none of these avenues of research will have the slightest impact on reducing the risk of additional emergence of viruses or other pathogens from wildlife. Novel schemes of preventing spillover of human pathogens from animal H(R)s can only spring from improving our understanding of the ecological context and biological interactions of pathogen maintenance among H(R)s. Although the benefit derived from investments to improve surveillance and knowledge of zoonotic pathogens circulating among wildlife H(R) populations is uncertain, our experience with HIV and the looming threat of pandemic avian influenza A inform us of the outcomes we can expect by relying on detection of post-spillover events among sentinel humans.

"A Muscovy duckling was presented for necropsy due to ongoing mortalities on a farm. Microscopic examination revealed multisystemic inflammatory lesions with intralesional and intracytoplasmic yeast-like organisms. We identified these agents as yeast belonging to the Order Saccharomycetales based on sequence data obtained from the ribosomal RNA operon.

"The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) is an emblematic species for conservation, and its decline in the British Isles exemplifies the impact that alien introductions can have on native ecosystems. Indeed, red squirrels in this region have declined dramatically over the last 60 years due to the spread of squirrelpox virus following the introduction of the gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). Currently, red squirrel populations in Britain are fragmented and need to be closely monitored in order to assess their viability and the effectiveness of conservation efforts. The situation is even more dramatic in the South of England, where S. vulgaris survives only on islands (Brownsea Island, Furzey Island, and the Isle of Wight). Using the D-loop, we investigated the genetic diversity and putative ancestry of the squirrels from Southern England and compared them to a European dataset composed of 1,016 samples from 54 populations. We found that our three populations were more closely related to other squirrels from the British Isles than squirrels from Europe, showed low genetic diversity, and also harbored several private haplotypes. Our study demonstrates how genetically unique the Southern English populations are in comparison with squirrels from the continental European range. We report the presence of four private haplotypes, suggesting that these populations may potentially harbor distinct genetic lineages. Our results emphasize the importance of preserving these isolated red squirrel populations for the conservation of the species.

"Lyme disease is a common tick-borne infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). B. burgdorferi s.s. may utilize chemotaxis, the directional migration towards or away from a chemical stimulus, for transmission, acquisition, and infection. However, the specific signals recognized by the spirochete for these events have not been defined. In this study, we identify an Ixodes scapularis salivary gland protein, Salp12, that is a chemoattractant for the spirochete. We demonstrate that Salp12 is expressed in the I. scapularis salivary glands and midgut and expression is not impacted by B. burgdorferi s.s. infection. Knockdown of Salp12 in the salivary glands or passive immunization against Salp12 reduces acquisition of the spirochete by ticks but acquisition is not completely prevented. Knockdown does not impact transmission of B. burgdorferi s.s. This work suggests a new role for chemotaxis in acquisition of the spirochete and suggests that recognition of Salp12 contributes to this phenomenon.

"We present a genome assembly from an individual male Sciurus vulgaris (the Eurasian red squirrel; Vertebrata; Mammalia; Eutheria; Rodentia; Sciuridae). The genome sequence is 2.88 gigabases in span. The majority of the assembly is scaffolded into 21 chromosomal-level scaffolds, with both X and Y sex chromosomes assembled.

"Immune heterogeneity in wild host populations indicates that disease-mediated selection is common in nature. However, the underlying dynamic feedbacks involving the ecology of disease transmission, evolutionary processes, and their interaction with environmental drivers have proven challenging to characterize. Plague presents an optimal system for interrogating such couplings: Yersinia pestis transmission exerts intense selective pressure driving the local persistence of disease resistance among its wildlife hosts in endemic areas. Investigations undertaken in colonial India after the introduction of plague in 1896 suggest that, only a decade after plague arrived, a heritable, plague-resistant phenotype had become prevalent among commensal rats of cities undergoing severe plague epidemics. To understand the possible evolutionary basis of these observations, we developed a mathematical model coupling environmentally forced plague dynamics with evolutionary selection of rats, capitalizing on extensive archival data from Indian Plague Commission investigations. Incorporating increased plague resistance among rats as a consequence of intense natural selection permits the model to reproduce observed changes in seasonal epidemic patterns in several cities and capture experimentally observed associations between climate and flea population dynamics in India. Our model results substantiate Victorian era claims of host evolution based on experimental observations of plague resistance and reveal the buffering effect of such evolution against environmental drivers of transmission. Our analysis shows that historical datasets can yield powerful insights into the transmission dynamics of reemerging disease agents with which we have limited contemporary experience to guide quantitative modeling and inference.

"The 2003 monkeypox virus (MPXV) outbreak and subsequent laboratory studies demonstrated that the black-tailed prairie dog is susceptible to MPXV infection and that the ensuing rash illness is similar to human systemic orthopoxvirus (OPXV) infection, including a 7- to 9-day incubation period and, likely, in some cases a respiratory route of infection; these features distinguish this model from others. The need for safe and efficacious vaccines for OPVX in areas where it is endemic or epidemic is important to protect an increasingly OPXV-naïve population. In this study, we tested current and investigational smallpox vaccines for safety, induction of anti-OPXV antibodies, and protection against mortality and morbidity in two MPXV challenges. None of the smallpox vaccines caused illness in this model, and all vaccinated animals showed anti-OPXV antibody responses and neutralizing antibody. We tested vaccine efficacy by challenging the animals with 10(5) or 10(6) PFU Congo Basin MPXV 30 days postvaccination and evaluating morbidity and mortality. Our results demonstrated that vaccination with either Dryvax or Acambis2000 protected the animals from death with no rash illness. Vaccination with IMVAMUNE also protected the animals from death, albeit with (modified) rash illness. Based on the results of this study, we believe prairie dogs offer a novel and potentially useful small animal model for the safety and efficacy testing of smallpox vaccines in pre- and postexposure vaccine testing, which is important for public health planning.

"Bats are implicated as natural reservoirs for a wide range of zoonotic viruses including SARS and MERS coronaviruses, Ebola, Marburg, Nipah, Hendra, Rabies and other lyssaviruses. Accordingly, many One Health surveillance and viral discovery programs have focused on bats. In this report we present viral metagenomic data from bats collected in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [KSA]. Unbiased high throughput sequencing of fecal samples from 72 bat individuals comprising four species; lesser mouse-tailed bat (Rhinopoma hardwickii), Egyptian tomb bat (Taphozous perforatus), straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum), and Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) revealed molecular evidence of a diverse set of viral families: Picornaviridae (hepatovirus, teschovirus, parechovirus), Reoviridae (rotavirus), Polyomaviridae (polyomavirus), Papillomaviridae (papillomavirus), Astroviridae (astrovirus), Caliciviridae (sapovirus), Coronaviridae (coronavirus), Adenoviridae (adenovirus), Paramyxoviridae (paramyxovirus), and unassigned mononegavirales (chuvirus). Additionally, we discovered a bastro-like virus (Middle East Hepe-Astrovirus), with a genomic organization similar to Hepeviridae. However, since it shared homology with Hepeviridae and Astroviridae at ORF1 and in ORF2, respectively, the newly discovered Hepe-Astrovirus may represent a phylogenetic bridge between Hepeviridae and Astroviridae.

"Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) has emerged as a powerful tool in the study of animal models of viral disease. BLI enables real-time in vivo study of viral infection, host immune response and the efficacy of intervention strategies. Substrate dependent light emitting luciferase enzyme when incorporated into a virus as a reporter gene enables detection of bioluminescence from infected cells using sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) camera systems. Advantages of BLI include low background, real-time tracking of infection in the same animal and reduction in the requirement for larger animal numbers. Transgenic luciferase-tagged mice enable the use of pre-existing nontagged viruses in BLI studies. Continued development in luciferase reporter genes, substrates, transgenic animals and imaging systems will greatly enhance future BLI strategies in viral research.

"The discussion of the calculus of biodiversity values in Chap. 5 is the final requisite prop for the stage across which this chapter parades accounts of how biodiversity is supposed to be valuable. The selection of these accounts is generous and represents a great majority of discussions on this topic, though it is not all-inclusive. It does include, among other theories, the theory that biodiversity is valuable for “unspecified moral reasons” (Sect. 6.1), that it is valuable as a resource (Sect. 6.2), as a service provider (Sect. 6.3), as a sustainer of human life (Sect. 6.4), as a key to human health, both as pharmacopoeia and as an inoculation against infection (Sect. 6.5), as the progenitor of human biophilic tendencies (Sect. 6.6), as a generator of (more) value (Sect. 6.7), as font of knowledge (Sect. 6.8), as having option (and quasi-option) value (Sect. 6.9), as transformative (Sect. 6.10), as having experiential value (Sect. 6.11), and as an expression of the natural order (Sect. 6.12). The chapter concludes (Sect. 6.13) with some proposals that are not customarily offered as self-contained theories of biodiversity value, but that are often suggested as still heavily influencing evaluation. These include what conservation biologists call “viability” and “endangerment” as well as conservation “efficiency”. Section 6.13 concludes with an extended discussion of the significance for biodiversity’s value of the history of human impingements on the natural world.

"Plague is one of the world's most lethal human diseases caused by Yersinia pestis, a Gram-negative bacterium. Despite overwhelming studies for many years worldwide, there is no safe and effective vaccine against this fatal disease. Inhalation of Y. pestis bacilli causes pneumonic plague, a fast growing and deadly dangerous disease. F1/LcrV-based vaccines failed to provide adequate protection in African green monkey model in spite of providing protection in mice and cynomolgus macaques. There is still no explanation for this inconsistent efficacy, and scientists leg behind to search reliable correlate assays for immune protection. These paucities are the main barriers to improve the effectiveness of plague vaccine. In the present scenario, one has to pay special attention to elicit strong cellular immune response in developing a next-generation vaccine against plague. Here, we review the scientific contributions and existing progress in developing subunit vaccines, the role of molecular adjuvants; DNA vaccines; live delivery platforms; and attenuated vaccines developed to counteract virulent strains of Y. pestis.

"The purpose of this study was to develop and optimize different processing, extraction, amplification, and sequencing methods for metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens. We applied mNGS to 10 CSF samples with known standard-of-care testing (SoC) results (8 positive and 2 negative). Each sample was subjected to nine different methods by varying the sample processing protocols (supernatant, pellet, neat CSF), sample pretreatment (with or without bead beating), and the requirement of nucleic acid amplification steps using DNA sequencing (DNASeq) (with or without whole-genome amplification [WGA]) and RNA sequencing (RNASeq) methods. Negative extraction controls (NECs) were used for each method variation (4/CSF sample). Host depletion (HD) was performed on a subset of samples. We correctly determined the pathogen in 7 of 8 positive samples by mNGS compared to SoC. The two negative samples were correctly interpreted as negative. The processing protocol applied to neat CSF specimens was found to be the most successful technique for all pathogen types. While bead beating introduced bias, we found it increased the detection yield of certain organism groups. WGA prior to DNASeq was beneficial for defining pathogens at the positive threshold, and a combined DNA and RNA approach yielded results with a higher confidence when detected by both methods. HD was required for detection of a low-level-positive enterovirus sample. We demonstrate that NECs are required for interpretation of these complex results and that it is important to understand the common contaminants introduced during mNGS. Optimizing mNGS requires the use of a combination of techniques to achieve the most sensitive, agnostic approach that nonetheless may be less sensitive than SoC tools.

"In recent years, refined molecular methods coupled with powerful high throughput sequencing technologies have increased the potential of virus discovery in clinical samples. However, host genetic material remains a complicating factor that interferes with discovery of novel viruses in solid tissue samples as the relative abundance of the virus material is low. Physical enrichment processing methods, although usually complicated, labor-intensive, and costly, have proven to be successful for improving sensitivity of virus detection in complex samples. In order to further increase detectability, we studied the application of fast and simple high-throughput virus enrichment methods on tissue homogenates. Probe sonication in high EDTA concentrations, organic extraction with Vertrel™ XF, or a combination of both, were applied prior to chromatography-like enrichment using Capto™ Core 700 resin, after which effects on virus detection sensitivity by the VIDISCA method were determined. Sonication in the presence of high concentrations of EDTA showed the best performance with an increased proportion of viral reads, up to 9.4 times, yet minimal effect on the host background signal. When this sonication procedure in high EDTA concentrations was followed by organic extraction with Vertrel™ XF and two rounds of core bead chromatography enrichment, an increase up to 10.5 times in the proportion of viral reads in the processed samples was achieved, with reduction of host background sequencing. We present a simple and semi-high-throughput method that can be used to enrich homogenized tissue samples for viral reads.

"Whilst lead poisoning in raptors, scavenging birds and waterfowl is well studied and common knowledge, there is surprisingly little literature detailing the risk to mammalian scavengers and captive carnivores fed hunted meat. This case report describes the death of two captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus) following acute onset of nervous symptoms. Clinical signs included hyper-excitability, seizures, arched back, tail held abnormally high and hyper-salivation. Necropsy findings included bullets or a bullet in their stomachs. Kidney and liver lead levels from one cheetah (15.6 ppm and 17 ppm respectively) were consistent with a diagnosis of lead poisoning; liver from the second cheetah was not available for testing. Both animals were routinely fed hunted antelope or game birds. This is the first report of oral lead poisoning in captive large carnivores, although these are unlikely to be the first cases. Without awareness of the risks of feeding hunted game, lead exposure will continue to be an underdiagnosed reality in the rehabilitation of endangered carnivores.

"Abhydrolase domain containing 16A (ABHD16A) is a member of the α/β hydrolase domain-containing (ABHD) protein family and is expressed in a variety of animal cells. Studies have shown that ABHD16A has acylglycerol lipase and phosphatidylserine lipase activities. Its gene location in the main histocompatibility complex (MHC) III gene cluster suggests that this protein may participate in the immunomodulation of the body. The results of studies investigating nearly 20 species of ABHDs reveal that the ABHD proteins are key factors in metabolic regulation and disease occurrence and development. In this paper, we summarize the related progress regarding the function of ABHD16A and other ABHD proteins. A prediction of the active sites and structural domains of ABHD16A and an analysis of the amino acid sites are included. Moreover, we analysed the amino acid sequences of the ABHD16A molecules in different species and provide an overview of the related functions and diseases associated with these proteins. The functions and diseases related to ABHD are systematically summarized and highlighted. Future research directions for studies investigating the functions and mechanisms of these proteins are also suggested. Further studies investigating the function of ABHD proteins may further confirm their positions as important determinants of lipid metabolism and related diseases.

"In July 2017, fever and sepsis developed in 3 recipients of solid organs (1 heart and 2 kidneys) from a common donor in the United States; 1 of the kidney recipients died. Tularemia was suspected only after blood cultures from the surviving kidney recipient grew Francisella species. The organ donor, a middle-aged man from the southwestern United States, had been hospitalized for acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure. F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (clade A2) was cultured from archived spleen tissue from the donor and blood from both kidney recipients. Whole-genome multilocus sequence typing indicated that the isolated strains were indistinguishable. The heart recipient remained seronegative with negative blood cultures but had been receiving antimicrobial drugs for a medical device infection before transplant. Two lagomorph carcasses collected near the donor's residence were positive by PCR for F. tularensis subsp. tularensis (clade A2). This investigation documents F. tularensis transmission by solid organ transplantation.

"During the last ice age, much of North America far south as 40°N was covered by glaciers (Hewitt 2000). About 20,000 years ago, as the glaciers retreated, the hydrologic landscape changed dramatically creating waterways for fish dispersal. The number of populations responsible for recolonization and the regions from which they recolonized are unknown for many freshwater fishes living in New England and southeastern Canada. The Blacknose Dace,Rhinichthys atratulus, is one of the freshwater fish species that recolonized this region. We hypothesize that the earliest deglaciated region, modern-day Connecticut, was recolonized byR. atratulusvia a single founding event by a single population. In this paper, we test this hypothesis phylogenetically with regard to the major drainage basins within Connecticut. The mitochondrial DNA exhibits low nucleotide diversity, high haplotype diversity, and a dominant haplotype found across the state. A small percentage of individuals in the Housatonic drainage basin, however, share a haplotype with populations in New York drainage basins, a haplotype not found elsewhere in Connecticut's drainage basins. We calculated a range for the rate of divergence for NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (nd2) and control region (ctr) of 4.43-6.76% and 3.84-8.48% per million years (my), respectively. While this range is higher than the commonly accepted rate of 2% for mitochondrial DNA, these results join a growing list of publications finding high rates of divergence for various taxa (Peterson and Masel 2009). The data support the conclusion that Connecticut as a whole was recolonized initially by a single founding event that came from a single refugium. Subsequently, the Housatonic basin alone experienced a secondary recolonization event.

"Human leptospirosis is a zoonotic and potentially fatal disease that has increasingly been reported in both developing and developed countries, including France. However, our understanding of the basic aspects of the epidemiology of this disease, including the source of Leptospira serogroup Australis infections in humans and domestic animals, remains incomplete. We investigated the genetic diversity of Leptospira in 28 species of wildlife other than rats using variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) and multispacer sequence typing (MST). The DNA of pathogenic Leptospira was detected in the kidney tissues of 201 individuals out of 3,738 tested individuals. A wide diversity, including 50 VNTR profiles and 8 MST profiles, was observed. Hedgehogs and mustelid species had the highest risk of being infected (logistic regression, OR = 66.8, CI95% = 30.9-144 and OR = 16.7, CI95% = 8.7-31.8, respectively). Almost all genetic profiles obtained from the hedgehogs were related to Leptospira interrogans Australis, suggesting the latter as a host-adapted bacterium, whereas mustelid species were infected by various genotypes, suggesting their interaction with Leptospira was different. By providing an inventory of the circulating strains of Leptospira and by pointing to hedgehogs as a potential reservoir of L. interrogans Australis, our study advances current knowledge on Leptospira animal carriers, and this information could serve to enhance epidemiological investigations in the future.

"Oxidative stress (OS), triggered by overproduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is the main mechanism responsible for several human diseases. The available one-target drugs often face such illnesses, by softening symptoms without eradicating the cause. Differently, natural polyphenols from fruits and vegetables possess multi-target abilities for counteracting OS, thus representing promising therapeutic alternatives and adjuvants. Although in several in vitro experiments, ellagitannins (ETs), ellagic acid (EA), and its metabolites urolithins (UROs) have shown similar great potential for the treatment of OS-mediated human diseases, only UROs have demonstrated in vivo the ability to reach tissues to a greater extent, thus appearing as the main molecules responsible for beneficial activities. Unfortunately, UROs production depends on individual metabotypes, and the consequent extreme variability limits their potentiality as novel therapeutics, as well as dietary assumption of EA, EA-enriched functional foods, and food supplements. This review focuses on the pathophysiology of OS; on EA and UROs chemical features and on the mechanisms of their antioxidant activity. A discussion on the clinical applicability of the debated UROs in place of EA and on the effectiveness of EA-enriched products is also included.

"Tularemia is a Holarctic zoonosis caused by the gamma proteobacterium Francisella tularensis and is considered to be a vector-borne disease. In many regions, human risk is associated with the bites of flies, mosquitoes, or ticks. But the biology of the agent is such that risk may be fomite related, and large outbreaks can occur due to inhalation or ingestion of contaminated materials. Such well-documented human risk factors suggest a role for these risk factors in the enzootic cycle as well. Many arthropods support the growth or survival of the agent, but whether arthropods (ticks in particular) are obligately required for the perpetuation of F. tularensis remains to be demonstrated. As with most zoonoses, our knowledge of the ecology of F. tularensis has been driven with the objective of understanding human risk. In this review, we focus on the role of the arthropod in maintaining F. tularensis, particularly with respect to long-term enzootic persistence.

"Nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts) are non-functional fragments of mtDNA inserted into the nuclear genome. Numts are prevalent across eukaryotes and a positive correlation is known to exist between the number of numts and the genome size. Most numt surveys have relied on model organisms with fully sequenced nuclear genomes, but such analyses have limited utilities for making a generalization about the patterns of numt accumulation for any given clade. Among insects, the order Orthoptera is known to have the largest nuclear genome and it is also reported to include several species with a large number of numts. In this study, we use Orthoptera as a case study to document the diversity and abundance of numts by generating numts of three mitochondrial loci across 28 orthopteran families, representing the phylogenetic diversity of the order. We discover that numts are rampant in all lineages, but there is no discernable and consistent pattern of numt accumulation among different lineages. Likewise, we do not find any evidence that a certain mitochondrial gene is more prone to nuclear insertion than others. We also find that numt insertion must have occurred continuously and frequently throughout the diversification of Orthoptera. Although most numts are the result of recent nuclear insertion, we find evidence of very ancient numt insertion shared by highly divergent families dating back to the Jurassic period. Finally, we discuss several factors contributing to the extreme prevalence of numts in Orthoptera and highlight the importance of exploring the utility of numts in evolutionary studies.

"Haematology parameters (N = 24) and serum biochemistry parameters (N = 35) were determined for wild Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber), between 6 months - 12 years old. Of the population tested in this study, N = 18 Eurasian beavers were from Norway and N = 17 originating from Bavaria but now living extensively in a reserve in England. All blood samples were collected from beavers via the ventral tail vein. All beavers were chemically restrained using inhalant isoflurane in 100% oxygen prior to blood sampling. Results were determined for haematological and serum biochemical parameters for the species and were compared between the two different populations with differences in means estimated and significant differences being noted. Standard blood parameters for the Eurasian beaver were determined and their ranges characterised using percentiles. Whilst the majority of blood parameters between the two populations showed no significant variation, haemoglobin, packed cell volume, mean cell haemoglobin and white blood cell counts showed significantly greater values (p<0.01) in the Bavarian origin population than the Norwegian; neutrophil counts, alpha 2 globulins, cholesterol, sodium: potassium ratios and phosphorus levels showed significantly (p<0.05) greater values in Bavarian versus Norwegian; and potassium, bile acids, gamma globulins, urea, creatinine and total calcium values levels showed significantly (p<0.05) greater values in Norwegian versus Bavarian relict populations. No significant differences were noted between male and female beavers or between sexually immature (<3 years old) and sexually mature (≥3 years old) beavers in the animals sampled. With Eurasian beaver reintroduction encouraged by legislation throughout Europe, knowledge of baseline blood values for the species and any variations therein is essential when assessing their health and welfare and the success or failure of any reintroduction program. This is the first study to produce base-line blood values and their variations for the Eurasian beaver.

"The incidence of Western Equine Encephalitis (WEE) in humans and equids peaked during the mid-20th century and has declined to fewer than 1-2 human cases annually during the past 20 years. Using the mouse model, changes in WEE virus (WEEV) virulence were investigated as a potential explanation for the decline in the number of cases. Evaluation of 10 WEEV strains representing a variety of isolation locations, hosts, and all decades from the 1940's to the 1990's yielded no evidence of a decline in virulence. These results suggest that ecological factors affecting human and equine exposure should be investigated to explain the decline in WEE.

"Chordopoxviruses of the subfamily Chordopoxvirinae, family Poxviridae, infect vertebrates and consist of at least eight genera with broad host ranges. For most chordopoxviruses, the number of viral genes and their relative order are highly conserved in the central region. The GC content of chordopoxvirus genomes, however, evolved into two distinct types: those with genome GC content of more than 60% and those with a content of less than 40% GC. Two standard PCR assays were developed to identify chordopoxviruses based on whether the target virus has a low or high GC content. In design of the assays, the genus Avipoxvirus, which encodes major rearrangements of gene clusters, was excluded. These pan-pox assays amplify DNA from more than 150 different isolates and strains, including from primary clinical materials, from all seven targeted genera of chordopoxviruses and four unclassified new poxvirus species. The pan-pox assays represent an important advance for the screening and diagnosis of human and animal poxvirus infections, and the technology used is accessible to many laboratories worldwide.

"Bartonella are ubiquitous gram-negative pathogens that cause chronic blood stream infections in mammals. Two species most often responsible for human infection, B. henselae and B. quintana, cause prolonged febrile illness in immunocompetent hosts, known as cat scratch disease and trench fever, respectively. Fascinatingly, in immunocompromised hosts, these organisms also induce new blood vessel formation leading to the formation of angioproliferative tumors, a disease process named bacillary angiomatosis. In addition, they cause an endothelial-lined cystic disease in the liver known as bacillary peliosis. Unfortunately, there are as yet no completely satisfying small animal models for exploring these unique human pathologies, as neither species appears able to sustain infection in small animal models. Therefore, we investigated the potential use of other Bartonella species for their ability to recapitulate human pathologies in an immunodeficient murine host. Here, we demonstrate the ability of Bartonella taylorii to cause chronic infection in SCID/BEIGE mice. In this model, Bartonella grows in extracellular aggregates, embedded within collagen matrix, similar to previous observations in cat scratch disease, bacillary peliosis, and bacillary angiomatosis. Interestingly, despite overwhelming infection later in disease, evidence for significant intracellular replication in endothelial or other cell types was not evident. We believe that this new model will provide an important new tool for investigation of Bartonella-host interaction.

"The indoor environment created by the construction of homes and other buildings is often considered to be uniquely different from other environments. It is composed of organisms that are less diverse than those of the outdoors and strongly sourced by, or dependent upon, human bodies. Yet, no one has ever compared the composition of species found in contemporary human homes to that of other structures built by mammals, including those of non-human primates. Here we consider the microbes and arthropods found in chimpanzee beds, relative to the surrounding environment (n = 41 and 15 beds, respectively). Based on the study of human homes, we hypothesized that the microbes found in chimpanzee beds would be less diverse than those on nearby branches and leaves and that their beds would be primarily composed of body-associated organisms. However, we found that differences between wet and dry seasons and elevation above sea level explained nearly all of the observed variation in microbial diversity and community structure. While we can identify the presence of a chimpanzee based on the assemblage of bacteria, the dominant signal is that of environmental microbes. We found just four ectoparasitic arthropod specimens, none of which appears to be specialized on chimpanzees or their structures. These results suggest that the life to which chimpanzees are exposed while in their beds is predominately the same as that of the surrounding environment.

"Borna disease virus (BDV) is a non-segmented negative-stranded RNA virus that maintains a strictly neurotropic and persistent infection in affected end hosts. The primary target cells for BDV infection are brain cells, e.g. neurons and astrocytes. The exact mechanism of how infection is propagated between these cells and especially the role of the viral glycoprotein (GP) for cell-cell transmission, however, are still incompletely understood. Here, we use different cell culture systems, including rat primary astrocytes and mixed cultures of rat brain cells, to show that BDV primarily spreads through cell-cell contacts. We employ a highly stable and efficient peptidomimetic inhibitor to inhibit the furin-mediated processing of GP and demonstrate that cleaved and fusion-active GP is strictly necessary for the cell-to-cell spread of BDV. Together, our quantitative observations clarify the role of Borna disease virus-glycoprotein for viral dissemination and highlight the regulation of GP expression as a potential mechanism to limit viral spread and maintain persistence. These findings furthermore indicate that targeting host cell proteases might be a promising approach to inhibit viral GP activation and spread of infection.

"An extended-release formulation of the NSAID meloxicam (MSR) is used to provide 72 h of continuous analgesia in many species, including rodents. Although standard formulations of meloxicam are frequently used in rats with no observable injection-site reactions, the potential adverse effects from MSR have not been characterized sufficiently nor has a prospective study of these effects been performed in rats. To address this deficiency, we evaluated injection-site reactions after a single subcutaneous administration of MSR (n = 16) or sterile saline (SC, n = 6) in the flank of age- and sex-matched Sprague-Dawley rats. Mass and erythema scores were measured daily for 2 wk, and injection sites were collected for histopathology after euthanasia. Rats were randomly selected for euthanasia at 7 d (n = 12) or 14 d (n = 10) after injection to capture the subacute and chronic phases of mass and erythematic lesion formation. No rats in the SC group developed lesions, whereas all 16 MSR-treated rats developed masses. The median time to first mass in the MSR treatment group was 3 d (95% CI, 2-3 d), and nearly 8 d for erythema (95% CI, 6.7-9.1 d). The trajectory of mass lesion severity showed rapid progression from score 1 at onset (day 2 or 3) to score 2 for almost all animals by day 5 or 6. Histopathology was characterized by localized inflammation with central necrosis and peripheral fibrosis, with some sections showing developing draining tracts. Given the high prevalence and severity of localized skin reactions, MSR analgesia should be considered carefully for Sprague-Dawley rats.

"The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), so named for its blood-curdling, nocturnal shrieks and snarls, is the largest of the carnivorous marsupials. Although once widely persecuted, concerted efforts are now being made to save the devil from extinction following the emergence of a fatal transmissible malignancy known as devil facial tumour disease (DFTD). DFTD is unusual in that the infectious agent is the cancer cell itself. This chapter discusses the aetiology and pathogenesis of DFTD as well as the profound impact the spread of DFTD has had on the devil’s conservation status. Strategies for managing DFTD and conserving the devil will be explored and the contribution of new sequencing technology to the field of conservation genetics and genomics will be examined with regard to the Tasmanian devil and DFTD.

"Many species are spatially and socially organized, with complex social organizations and dispersal patterns that are increasingly documented. Social species typically consist of small age-structured units, where a limited number of individuals monopolize reproduction and exhibit complex mating strategies. Here, we model social groups as age-structured units and investigate the genetic consequences of social structure under distinct mating strategies commonly found in mammals. Our results show that sociality maximizes genotypic diversity, which contradicts the belief that social groups are necessarily subject to strong genetic drift and at high risk of inbreeding depression. Social structure generates an excess of genotypic diversity. This is commonly observed in ecological studies but rarely reported in population genetic studies that ignore social structure. This heterozygosity excess, when detected, is often interpreted as a consequence of inbreeding avoidance mechanisms, but we show that it can occur even in the absence of such mechanisms. Many seemly contradictory results from ecology and population genetics can be reconciled by genetic models that include the complexities of social species. We find that such discrepancies can be explained by the intrinsic properties of social groups and by the sampling strategies of real populations. In particular, the number of social groups and the nature of the individuals that compose samples (e.g., nonreproductive and reproductive individuals) are key factors in generating outbreeding signatures. Sociality is an important component of population structure that needs to be revisited by ecologists and population geneticists alike.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has put the world economy at an unprecedented position and protecting society from the infection is at the core of all measures. As the COVID-19 virus stays longer on plastic and stainless steel materials, hence the healthcare wastes (HCW), coming out of the treatment of COVID-19 infected patients can be one of the potential route for transmission of infection. Therefore, the present study analyses the dimensions of sustainable HCWM by using a multi-method approach: PESTEL (political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal) analysis, TISM (total interpretive structural modeling) and fuzzy- MICMAC (cross-impact matrix multiplication applied to classification) analysis. The opted research framework yields 17 PESTEL dimensions of sustainable HCWM during the COVID-19 outbreak through the literature survey and experts' discussions. Then, the TISM methodology developed a hierarchical digraph of all the 17 dimensions of sustainable HCWM based on the interrelationships. Fuzzy-MICMAC analysis classified all 17 PESTEL dimensions into four groups depending upon their driving and dependence powers. The study concluded that the policy framework for targeting political, legal and environmental issues should be the immediate concern of the worldwide governments and health officials. The effluent control and compliance to environmental laws being the output dimensions should be tracked regularly for ensuring the cleaner production in healthcare services. The PESTEL analysis will help the hospitals' managers and policymakers to understand the macro-environment surrounding the HCWM.

"Populations of large wildlife are declining on local and global scales. The impacts of this pulse of size-selective defaunation include cascading changes to smaller animals, particularly rodents, and alteration of many ecosystem processes and services, potentially involving changes to prevalence and transmission of zoonotic disease. Understanding linkages between biodiversity loss and zoonotic disease is important for both public health and nature conservation programs, and has been a source of much recent scientific debate. In the case of rodent-borne zoonoses, there is strong conceptual support, but limited empirical evidence, for the hypothesis that defaunation, the loss of large wildlife, increases zoonotic disease risk by directly or indirectly releasing controls on rodent density. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally excluding large wildlife from a savanna ecosystem in East Africa, and examining changes in prevalence and abundance of Bartonella spp. infection in rodents and their flea vectors. We found no effect of wildlife removal on per capita prevalence of Bartonella infection in either rodents or fleas. However, because rodent and, consequently, flea abundance doubled following experimental defaunation, the density of infected hosts and infected fleas was roughly twofold higher in sites where large wildlife was absent. Thus, defaunation represents an elevated risk in Bartonella transmission to humans (bartonellosis). Our results (i) provide experimental evidence of large wildlife defaunation increasing landscape-level disease prevalence, (ii) highlight the importance of susceptible host regulation pathways and host/vector density responses in biodiversity-disease relationships, and (iii) suggest that rodent-borne disease responses to large wildlife loss may represent an important context where this relationship is largely negative.

"BACKGROUND: Retroviruses utilize multiple unique RNA elements to control RNA processing and translation. However, it is unclear what functional RNA elements are present in endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Gene co-option from ERVs sometimes entails the conservation of viral cis-elements required for gene expression, which might reveal the RNA regulation in ERVs. RESULTS: Here, we characterized an RNA element found in ERVs consisting of three specific sequence motifs, called SPRE. The SPRE-like elements were found in different ERV families but not in any exogenous viral sequences examined. We observed more than a thousand of copies of the SPRE-like elements in several mammalian genomes; in human and marmoset genomes, they overlapped with lineage-specific ERVs. SPRE was originally found in human syncytin-1 and syncytin-2. Indeed, several mammalian syncytin genes: mac-syncytin-3 of macaque, syncytin-Ten1 of tenrec, and syncytin-Car1 of Carnivora, contained the SPRE-like elements. A reporter assay revealed that the enhancement of gene expression by SPRE depended on the reporter genes. Mutation of SPRE impaired the wild-type syncytin-2 expression while the same mutation did not affect codon-optimized syncytin-2, suggesting that SPRE activity depends on the coding sequence. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate multiple independent invasions of various mammalian genomes by retroviruses harboring SPRE-like elements. Functional SPRE-like elements are found in several syncytin genes derived from these retroviruses. This element may facilitate the expression of viral genes, which were suppressed due to inefficient codon frequency or repressive elements within the coding sequences. These findings provide new insights into the long-term evolution of RNA elements and molecular mechanisms of gene expression in retroviruses.

"Numerous pathogens are transmitted from one host to another by hematophagous insect vectors. The interactions between a vector-borne organism and its vector vary in many ways, most of which are yet to be explored and identified. These interactions may play a role in the dynamics of the infection cycle. One way to evaluate these interactions is by studying the effects of the tested organism on the vector. In this study, we tested the effects of infection with Bartonella species on fitness-related variables of fleas by using Bartonella sp. strain OE 1-1, Xenopsylla ramesis fleas, and Meriones crassus jirds as a model system. Feeding parameters, including blood meal size and metabolic rate during digestion, as well as reproductive parameters, including fecundity, fertility, and life span, were compared between fleas experimentally infected with Bartonella and uninfected fleas. In addition, the developmental time, sex ratio, and body size of F1 offspring fleas were compared between the two groups. Most tested parameters did not differ between infected and uninfected fleas. However, F1 males produced by Bartonella-positive females were significantly smaller than F1 males produced by Bartonella-negative female fleas. The findings in this study suggest that bartonellae are well adapted to their flea vectors, and by minimally affecting their fitness they have evolved to better spread themselves in the natural environment.

"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widely distributed, tick-borne viral disease. Humans are the only species known to develop illness after CCHF virus (CCHFV) infection, characterized by a nonspecific febrile illness that can progress to severe, often fatal, hemorrhagic disease. A variety of animals may serve as asymptomatic reservoirs of CCHFV in an endemic cycle of transmission. Seroepidemiological studies have been instrumental in elucidating CCHFV reservoirs and in determining endemic foci of viral transmission. Herein, we review over 50 years of CCHFV seroepidemiological studies in domestic and wild animals. This review highlights the role of livestock in the maintenance and transmission of CCHFV, and provides a detailed summary of seroepidemiological studies of wild animal species, reflecting their relative roles in CCHFV ecology.

"The primary driver of the observed increase in emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) has been identified as human interaction with wildlife and this increase has emphasized knowledge gaps in wildlife pathogens dynamics. Wild rodent models have proven excellent for studying changes in parasite communities and have been a particular focus of eco-immunological research. Helminth species have been shown to be one of the factors regulating rodent abundance and indirectly affect disease burden through trade-offs between immune pathways. The Myodes glareolus invasion in Ireland is a unique model system to explore the invasion dynamics of helminth species. Studies of the invasive population of M. glareolus in Ireland have revealed a verifiable introduction point and its steady spread. Helminths studies of this invasion have identified enemy release, spillover, spillback and dilution taking place. Longitudinal studies have the potential to demonstrate the interplay between helminth parasite dynamics and both immune adaptation and coinfecting microparasites as M. glareolus become established across Ireland. Using the M. glareolus invasion as a model system and other similar wildlife systems, we can begin to fill the large gap in our knowledge surrounding the area of wildlife pathogen dynamics.

"The success of an invasive species depends in part on its niche and the new niche opportunities that such species may find in the invaded habitat. Niche opportunities can be understood as the potential provided by a community to an invasive species to expand its niche by changes in habitat use, behavior, or diet, that favors population growth, reflected in the species occupying more habitat. This may occur under a favorable combination of access to resources that can be further favored by a lack of competitors and a release from natural enemies. The American mink (Neovison vison) is a crepuscular/nocturnal and semi-aquatic mustelid native to North America that generally concentrates activities at <100 m from the water. It has recently established an invasive population on Navarino Island in southern Chile. Here, the mink is now the top terrestrial predator free of predators or competitors. We hypothesized that this lack of potential predators and competitors, together with a more diurnal and terrestrial prey, have resulted in the mink expanding its spatial and temporal niche on Navarino Island as compared to that in its native habitats, expressed in occupancy of sites away from water and diurnal activity. We evaluated this by using 93 randomly-chosen camera-trap stations, occupancy models and mink daily activity patterns. Models showed a dynamic occupancy with the area occupied by mink being highest during summers and lowest in spring with seasonal changes in occupancy related to distance to water sources. Mink occupied and were active at sites up to 880 m from water sources during summers. Occupancy decreased at shorter distances from water during spring, but mink were still active at up to 300 m from water. Mink were active daylong during summers, and nocturnal and crepuscular during winter and spring. These results show that compared to the native and other invaded habitats, on Navarino Island mink use more terrestrial habitats and are more diurnal during summers, suggesting a niche expansion under new niche opportunities that may enhance the negative impacts of this predator on a myriad of small native vertebrates.

"In the Anthropocene context, changes in climate, land use and biodiversity are considered among the most important anthropogenic factors affecting parasites-host interaction and wildlife zoonotic diseases emergence. Transmission of vector borne pathogens are particularly sensitive to these changes due to the complexity of their cycle, where the transmission of a microparasite depends on the interaction between its vector, usually a macroparasite, and its reservoir host, in many cases represented by a wildlife vertebrate. The scope of this paper focuses on the effect of some major, fast-occurring anthropogenic changes on the vectorial capacity for tick and mosquito borne pathogens. Specifically, we review and present the latest advances regarding two emerging vector-borne viruses in Europe: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and West Nile virus (WNV). In both cases, variation in vector to host ratio is critical in determining the intensity of pathogen transmission and consequently infection hazard for humans. Forecasting vector-borne disease hazard under the global change scenarios is particularly challenging, requiring long term studies based on a multidisciplinary approach in a One-Health framework.

"Lyme borreliosis is an emerging infectious human disease caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex of bacteria with reported cases increasing in many areas of Europe and North America. To understand the drivers of disease risk and the distribution of symptoms, which may improve mitigation and diagnostics, here we characterize the genetics, distribution, and environmental associations of B. burgdorferi s.l. genospecies across Scotland. In Scotland, reported Lyme borreliosis cases have increased almost 10-fold since 2000 but the distribution of B. burgdorferi s.l. is so far unstudied. Using a large survey of over 2200 Ixodes ricinus tick samples collected from birds, mammals, and vegetation across 25 sites we identified four genospecies: Borrelia afzelii (48%), Borrelia garinii (36%), Borrelia valaisiana (8%), and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (7%), and one mixed genospecies infection. Surprisingly, 90% of the sequence types were novel and, importantly, up to 14% of samples were mixed intra-genospecies co-infections, suggesting tick co-feeding, feeding on multiple hosts, or multiple infections in hosts. B. garinii (hosted by birds) was considerably more genetically diverse than B. afzelii (hosted by small mammals), as predicted since there are more species of birds than small mammals and birds can import strains from mainland Europe. Higher proportions of samples contained B. garinii and B. valaisiana in the west, while B. afzelii and B. garinii were significantly more associated with mixed/deciduous than with coniferous woodlands. This may relate to the abundance of transmission hosts in different regions and habitats. These data on the genetic heterogeneity within and between Borrelia genospecies are a first step to understand pathogen spread and could help explain the distribution of patient symptoms, which may aid local diagnosis. Understanding the environmental associations of the pathogens is critical for rational policy making for disease risk mitigation and land management.

"Wildlife vaccination is of urgent interest to reduce disease-induced extinction and zoonotic spillover events. However, several challenges complicate its application to wildlife. For example, vaccines rarely provide perfect immunity. While some protection may seem better than none, imperfect vaccination can present epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary challenges. While anti-infection and antitransmission vaccines reduce parasite transmission, antidisease vaccines may undermine herd immunity, select for increased virulence, or promote spillover. These imperfections interact with ecological and logistical constraints that are magnified in wildlife, such as poor control and substantial trait variation within and among species. Ultimately, we recommend approaches such as trait-based vaccination, modeling tools, and methods to assess community- and ecosystem-level vaccine safety to address these concerns and bolster wildlife vaccination campaigns.

"Giardia causes the diarrheal disease known as giardiasis; transmission through contaminated surface water is common. The protozoan parasite's genetic diversity has major implications for human health and epidemiology. To determine the extent of transmission from wildlife through surface water, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize 89 Giardia duodenalis isolates from both outbreak and sporadic infections: 29 isolates from raw surface water, 38 from humans, and 22 from veterinary sources. Using single nucleotide variants (SNVs), combined with epidemiological data, relationships contributing to zoonotic transmission were described. Two assemblages, A and B, were identified in surface water, human, and veterinary isolates. Mixes of zoonotic assemblages A and B were seen in all the community waterborne outbreaks in British Columbia (BC), Canada, studied. Assemblage A was further subdivided into assemblages A1 and A2 based on the genetic variation observed. The A1 assemblage was highly clonal; isolates of surface water, human, and veterinary origins from Canada, United States, and New Zealand clustered together with minor variation, consistent with this being a panglobal zoonotic lineage. In contrast, assemblage B isolates were variable and consisted of several clonal lineages relating to waterborne outbreaks and geographic locations. Most human infection isolates in waterborne outbreaks clustered with isolates from surface water and beavers implicated to be outbreak sources by public health. In-depth outbreak analysis demonstrated that beavers can act as amplification hosts for human infections and can act as sources of surface water contamination. It is also known that other wild and domesticated animals, as well as humans, can be sources of waterborne giardiasis. This study demonstrates the utility of WGS in furthering our understanding of Giardia transmission dynamics at the water-human-animal interface.IMPORTANCEGiardia duodenalis causes large numbers of gastrointestinal illness in humans. Its transmission through the contaminated surface water/wildlife intersect is significant, and the water-dwelling rodents beavers have been implicated as one important reservoir. To trace human infections to their source, we used genome techniques to characterize genetic relationships among 89 Giardia isolates from surface water, humans, and animals. Our study showed the presence of two previously described genetic assemblages, A and B, with mixed infections detected from isolates collected during outbreaks. Study findings also showed that while assemblage A could be divided into A1 and A2, A1 showed little genetic variation among animal and human hosts in isolates collected from across the globe. Assemblage B, the most common type found in the study surface water samples, was shown to be highly variable. Our study demonstrates that the beaver is a possible source of human infections from contaminated surface water, while acknowledging that theirs is only one role in the complex cycle of zoonotic spread. Mixes of parasite groups have been detected in waterborne outbreaks. More information on Giardia diversity and its evolution using genomics will further the understanding of the epidemiology of spread of this disease-causing protozoan.

"The cyclical proliferation of the wild fossorial rodent Arvicola terrestris scherman (ATS) is critical in mid-mountain ecosystems of several European countries. Our goal is to develop an immunocontraceptive vaccine to control their fertility, as a sustainable alternative to chemical poisons currently used. Indeed, these chemicals cause the death of ATS predators and animals sharing their ecosystem, and current laws progressively limit their use, making the development of a targeted vaccination strategy an interesting and efficient alternative. In order to identify species-specific sperm antigens, male and female ATS received subcutaneous injections of whole ATS spermatozoa to elicit an immune response. The analysis of the immune sera led to the identification of 120 immunogenic proteins of sperm cells. Of these, 15 were strictly sperm-specific and located in different regions of the male gamete. Some of these antigens are proteins involved in molecular events essential to the reproductive process, such as sperm-egg interaction, acrosomal reaction, or sperm motility. This approach not only identified a panel of immunogenic proteins from ATS sperm cells, but also demonstrated that some of these proteins trigger an immune response in both male and female ATS. These spermatic antigens are good candidates for the development of a contraceptive vaccine.

"Plague is caused by a bacterial pathogen (Yersinia pestis) that can infect a wide range of mammal species, but its presence in wildlife is often underappreciated. Using a large-scale data set (n = 44,857) that details the extent of Y. pestis exposure in wildlife, we document exposure in 18 wildlife species, including coyotes (Canis latrans), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and black bears (Ursus americanus). Evidence of plague activity is widespread, with seropositive animals detected in every western state in the contiguous United States. Pathogen monitoring systems in wildlife that are both large scale and long-term are rare, yet they open the door for analyses on potential shifts in distribution that have occurred over time because of climate or land use changes. The data generated by these long-term monitoring programs, combined with recent advances in our understanding of pathogen ecology, offer a clearer picture of zoonotic pathogens and the risks they pose.

"1. Electrical stimulation (10 s) of the ethmoidal nerve (EN5) evokes the nasotrigeminal reflex responses, including apnoea, bradycardia and rise in arterial blood pressure. In the present study, we examined the involvement of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), AMPA/kainate, (gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) and glycine receptors in the Kolliker-Fuse (KF) nucleus in the mediation of the nasotrigeminal reflex responses. 2. Unilateral injections (n = 6) of 50-100 nl of the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 into the KF area led to a significant blockade of the EN5-evoked respiratory depression and bradycardia. Injections placed into the midlevel of the KF area were most effective (80-90 % blockade). The rise in arterial blood pressure remained unaffected. 3. Unilateral injections (n = 6) of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX into the KF area failed to block EN5-evoked autonomic responses significantly. 4. Unilateral injections (n = 5) of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline enhanced the EN5-evoked respiratory depression and bradycardia. The effect persisted for up to 30 s after stimulation. Bicuculline injections into the midlevel of the KF area were most effective. The increase in arterial blood pressure remained unaffected. 5. Unilateral injections (n = 5) of the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine into the KF area did not produce any significant effects on EN5-evoked autonomic responses. 6. Our results suggest that the KF area represents a mandatory relay for the nasotrigeminally induced apnoea and bradycardia which are predominantly mediated by NMDA receptors in the KF. Furthermore, it appears that KF neurons are under a potent GABAergic inhibitory control. The EN5-evoked rise in arterial blood pressure was not altered by any of the drugs and, therefore, appears not to be mediated via the KF.

"The patterns of species co-occurrence have long served as a primary approach to explore concepts of interspecific interaction. However, the interpretation of such patterns is difficult as they can result from several complex ecological processes, in a scale-dependent manner. Here, we aim to investigate the co-occurrence pattern between European rabbit and wild boar in an estate in Central Portugal, using two-species occupancy modelling. With this framework, we tested species interaction for occupancy and detection, but also the interdependencies between both parameters. According to our results, the wild boar and European rabbit occurred independently in the study area. However, model averaging of the detection parameters revealed a potential positive effect of wild boar's presence on rabbit's detection probability. Upon further analysis of the parameter interdependencies, our results suggested that failing to account for a positive effect on rabbit's detection could lead to potentially biased interpretations of the co-occurrence pattern. Our study, in spite of preliminary, highlights the need to understand these different pathways of species interaction to avoid erroneous inferences.

"BACKGROUND: Akkermansia muciniphila is a member of the human gut microbiota where it resides in the mucus layer and uses mucin as the sole carbon, nitrogen and energy source. A. muciniphila is the only representative of the Verrucomicrobia phylum in the human gut. However, A. muciniphila 16S rRNA gene sequences have also been found in the intestines of many vertebrates. RESULTS: We detected A. muciniphila-like bacteria in the intestines of animals belonging to 15 out of 16 mammalian orders. In addition, other species belonging to the Verrucomicrobia phylum were detected in fecal samples. We isolated 10 new A. muciniphila strains from the feces of chimpanzee, siamang, mouse, pig, reindeer, horse and elephant. The physiology and genome of these strains were highly similar in comparison to the type strain A. muciniphila Muc(T). Overall, the genomes of the new strains showed high average nucleotide identity (93.9 to 99.7%). In these genomes, we detected considerable conservation of at least 75 of the 78 mucin degradation genes that were previously detected in the genome of the type strain Muc(T). CONCLUSIONS: The low genomic divergence observed in the new strains may indicate that A. muciniphila favors mucosal colonization independent of the differences in hosts. In addition, the conserved mucus degradation capability points towards a similar beneficial role of the new strains in regulating host metabolic health.

"Human babesiosis in Europe has been attributed to infection with Babesia divergens and, to a lesser extent, with Babesia venatorum and Babesia microti, which are all transmitted to humans through a bite of Ixodes ricinus. These Babesia species circulate in the Netherlands, but autochthonous human babesiosis cases have not been reported so far. To gain more insight into the natural sources of these Babesia species, their presence in reservoir hosts and in I. ricinus was examined. Moreover, part of the ticks were tested for co-infections with other tick borne pathogens. In a cross-sectional study, qPCR-detection was used to determine the presence of Babesia species in 4611 tissue samples from 27 mammalian species and 13 bird species. Reverse line blotting (RLB) and qPCR detection of Babesia species were used to test 25,849 questing I. ricinus. Fragments of the 18S rDNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from PCR-positive isolates were sequenced for confirmation and species identification and species-specific PCR reactions were performed on samples with suspected mixed infections. Babesia microti was found in two widespread rodent species: Myodes glareolus and Apodemus sylvaticus, whereas B. divergens was detected in the geographically restricted Cervus elaphus and Bison bonasus, and occasionally in free-ranging Ovis aries. B. venatorum was detected in the ubiquitous Capreolus capreolus, and occasionally in free-ranging O. aries. Species-specific PCR revealed co-infections in C. capreolus and C. elaphus, resulting in higher prevalence of B. venatorum and B. divergens than disclosed by qPCR detection, followed by 18S rDNA and COI sequencing. The non-zoonotic Babesia species found were Babesia capreoli, Babesia vulpes, Babesia sp. deer clade, and badger-associated Babesia species. The infection rate of zoonotic Babesia species in questing I. ricinus ticks was higher for Babesia clade I (2.6%) than Babesia clade X (1.9%). Co-infection of B. microti with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Neoehrlichia mikurensis in questing nymphs occurred more than expected, which reflects their mutual reservoir hosts, and suggests the possibility of co-transmission of these three pathogens to humans during a tick bite. The ubiquitous spread and abundance of B. microti and B. venatorum in their reservoir hosts and questing ticks imply some level of human exposure through tick bites. The restricted distribution of the wild reservoir hosts for B. divergens and its low infection rate in ticks might contribute to the absence of reported autochthonous cases of human babesiosis in the Netherlands.

"Aedes invasive mosquitoes (AIMs) play a key role as vectors of several pathogens of public health relevance. Four species have been established in Europe, including Aedes aegypti, Aedesalbopictus, Aedes japonicus and Aedes koreicus. In addition, Aedes atropalpus has been repeatedly recorded although it has not yet been established. In spite of their importance in the transmission of endemic (e.g., heartworms) and imported pathogens (e.g., dengue virus), basic information of parameters affecting their vectorial capacity is poorly investigated. The aim of this study is to review the blood feeding patterns of these invasive mosquito species in Europe, summarizing available information from their native and introduced distribution ranges. The feeding patterns of mosquitoes constitute a key parameter affecting the contact rates between infected and susceptible hosts, thus playing a central role in the epidemiology of mosquito-borne pathogens. Our results highlight that these mosquito species feed on the blood of different vertebrate groups from ectotherms to birds and mammals. However, humans represent the most important source of blood for these species, accounting for 36% and 93% of hosts identified for Ae. japonicus and Ae. aegypti, respectively. In spite of that, limited information has been obtained for some particular species, such as Ae. koreicus, or it is restricted to a few particular areas. Given the high vector competence of the four AIM species for the transmission of different emerging arboviruses such as dengue, Chikungunya, Zika or Yellow fever viruses and their high feeding rates on humans, these AIM species may have an important impact on the vectorial capacity for such pathogens on urban and periurban areas. Finally, we propose directions for future research lines based on identified knowledge gaps.

"BACKGROUND: Viral aetiologies are the most common cause of central nervous system (CNS) infections. Approximately one-half of CNS infections remain of undetermined origin. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) brought new perspectives to CNS infection investigations, allowing investigation of viral aetiologies with an unbiased approach. HTS use is still limited to specific clinical situations. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to evaluate the contribution and pitfalls of HTS for the aetiologic identification of viral encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis in CNS patient samples. SOURCES: PubMed was searched from 1 January 2008 to 2 August 2018 to retrieve available studies on the topic. Additional publications were included from a review of full-text sources. CONTENT: Among 366 studies retrieved, 29 used HTS as a diagnostic technique. HTS was performed in cerebrospinal fluid and brain biopsy samples of 307 patients, including immunocompromised, immunocompetent paediatric, and adult cases. HTS was performed retrospectively in 18 studies and prospectively in 11. HTS led to the identification of a potential causal virus in 41 patients, with 11 viruses known and ten not expected to cause CNS infections. Various HTS protocols were used. IMPLICATIONS: The additional value of HTS is difficult to quantify because of various biases. Nevertheless, HTS led to the identification of a viral cause in 13% of encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and meningitis cases in which various assays failed to identify the cause. HTS should be considered early in clinical management as a complement to routine assays. Standardized strategies and systematic studies are needed for the integration of HTS in clinical management.

"Lin-28 is an RNA-binding protein that is known for its role in promoting the pluripotency of stem cells. In the present study, Arabian camel Lin-28 (cLin-28) cDNA was identified and analyzed. Full length cLin-28 mRNA was obtained using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). It was shown to be 715 bp in length, and the open reading frame (ORF) encoded 205 amino acids. The molecular weight and theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of the cLin-28 protein were predicted to be 22.389 kDa and 8.50, respectively. Results from the bioinformatics analysis revealed that cLin-28 has two main domains: an N-terminal cold-shock domain (CSD) and a C-terminal pair of retroviral-type Cysteine3Histidine (CCHC) zinc fingers. Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis showed that the cLin-28 protein is grouped together Camelus bactrianus and Bos taurus. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis showed that cLin-28 mRNA is highly expressed in the lung, heart, liver, and esophageal tissues. Peptide mass fingerprint-mass spectrometry (PMF-MS) analysis of the purified cLin-28 protein confirmed the identity of this protein. Comparing the modeled 3D structure of cLin-28 protein with the available protein 3D structure of the human Lin-28 protein confirmed the presence of CSD and retroviral-type CCHC zinc fingers, and high similarities were noted between the two structures by using super secondary structure prediction.

"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of pathogens is becoming increasingly important not only for basic research but also for clinical science and practice. In virology, WGS is important for the development of novel treatments and vaccines, and for increasing the power of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genomics. In this Opinion article, we suggest that WGS of viruses in a clinical setting will become increasingly important for patient care. We give an overview of different WGS methods that are used in virology and summarize their advantages and disadvantages. Although there are only partially addressed technical, financial and ethical issues in regard to the clinical application of viral WGS, this technique provides important insights into virus transmission, evolution and pathogenesis.

"Rates of encounters between humans and wildlife are increasing in cities around the world, especially when wildlife overlap with people in time, space and resources. Coyotes (Canis latrans) can make use of anthropogenic resources and reported rates of conflict have increased in cities across North America. This increase may be linked to individual differences in the use of human food and developed areas. We compared the relationships between coyote age, sex or health and the use of anthropogenic resources, which we defined as using developed areas over large home ranges, being active during the day, and consuming anthropogenic food. To do so, we applied GPS collars to 19 coyotes and sampled hair for stable isotope analysis. Eleven coyotes appeared to be healthy and eight were visibly infested with sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei), a mite that causes hair loss. Diseased coyotes used more developed areas, had larger monthly home ranges, were more active during the day, and assimilated less protein than coyotes that appeared to be healthy. We speculate that anthropogenic food provides a low-quality but easily accessible food source for diseased coyotes, which in turn may increase reliance on it and other anthropogenic resources to promote encounters with people.

"Advances in mouse neural circuit genetics, brain atlases, and behavioral assays provide a powerful system for modeling the genetic basis of cognition and psychiatric disease. However, a critical limitation of this approach is how to achieve concordance of mouse neurobiology with the ultimate goal of understanding the human brain. Previously, the common marmoset has shown promise as a genetic model system toward the linking of mouse and human studies. However, the advent of marmoset transgenic approaches will require an understanding of developmental principles in marmoset compared to mouse. In this study, we used gene expression analysis in marmoset brain to pose a series of fundamental questions on cortical development and evolution for direct comparison to existing mouse brain atlas expression data. Most genes showed reliable conservation of expression between marmoset and mouse. However, certain markers had strikingly divergent expression patterns. The lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar in the thalamus showed diversification of genetic organization between marmoset and mouse, suggesting they share some similarity. In contrast, gene expression patterns in early visual cortical areas showed marmoset-specific expression. In prefrontal cortex, some markers labeled architectonic areas and layers distinct between mouse and marmoset. Core hippocampus was conserved, while afferent areas showed divergence. Together, these results indicate that existing cortical areas are genetically conserved between marmoset and mouse, while differences in areal parcellation, afferent diversification, and layer complexity are associated with specific genes. Collectively, we propose that gene expression patterns in marmoset brain reveal important clues to the principles underlying the molecular evolution of cortical and cognitive expansion.

"BACKGROUND: Landscape structure can affect pathogen prevalence and persistence with consequences for human and animal health. Few studies have examined how reservoir host species traits may interact with landscape structure to alter pathogen communities and dynamics. Using a landscape of islands and mainland sites we investigated how natural landscape fragmentation affects the prevalence and persistence of the zoonotic tick-borne pathogen complex Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), which causes Lyme borreliosis. We hypothesized that the prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) would be lower on islands compared to the mainland and B. afzelii, a small mammal specialist genospecies, would be more affected by isolation than bird-associated B. garinii and B. valaisiana and the generalist B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto). METHODS: Questing (host-seeking) nymphal I. ricinus ticks (n = 6567) were collected from 12 island and 6 mainland sites in 2011, 2013 and 2015 and tested for B. burgdorferi (s.l.). Deer abundance was estimated using dung transects. RESULTS: The prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) was significantly higher on the mainland (2.5%, 47/1891) compared to island sites (0.9%, 44/4673) (P < 0.01). While all four genospecies of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) were detected on the mainland, bird-associated species B. garinii and B. valaisiana and the generalist genospecies B. burgdorferi (s.s.) predominated on islands. CONCLUSION: We found that landscape structure influenced the prevalence of a zoonotic pathogen, with a lower prevalence detected among island sites compared to the mainland. This was mainly due to the significantly lower prevalence of small mammal-associated B. afzelii. Deer abundance was not related to pathogen prevalence, suggesting that the structure and dynamics of the reservoir host community underpins the observed prevalence patterns, with the higher mobility of bird hosts compared to small mammal hosts leading to a relative predominance of the bird-associated genospecies B. garinii and generalist genospecies B. burgdorferi (s.s.) on islands. In contrast, the lower prevalence of B. afzelii on islands may be due to small mammal populations there exhibiting lower densities, less immigration and stronger population fluctuations. This study suggests that landscape fragmentation can influence the prevalence of a zoonotic pathogen, dependent on the biology of the reservoir host.

"BACKGROUND: Spondylitis is an inflammation of the vertebrae that leads to a destructive process with exuberant new bone formation. Osteomyelitis can produce a distortion of the bone architecture, degenerative joint changes and ankyloses of adjacent vertebrae. In reptiles, intervertebral discs are absent, so the term discospondylitis is not used. In lizards, vertebral lesions have not been well studied. The present paper describes the first case of Klebsiella sp.-related spondylitis in a pet lizard (Pogona vitticeps). CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old, female bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) was presented for clinical examination due to a decreased activity level, decreased appetite and constipation. Blood tests showed no remarkable alterations. The haemogram showed normal parameters with relative lymphocytosis, although the absolute number of lymphocytes did not differ from the reference values. A computed tomography scan revealed a mixed osteolytic-proliferative bone lesion diffusing to the first and last tracts of the pre-sacral vertebrae together. A small amount of material obtained from the spinal swelling was sampled with an aseptic technique for bacterial culture, which was positive for Klebsiella sp. The antibiogram revealed sensitivity to enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and chloramphenicol and intermediate sensitivity to gentamicin. Complete return to spontaneous feeding was achieved 15 days after the beginning of antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In veterinary medicine, spondylitis represents a well-known disease in small companion animals. In mammals, the most common aetiologic agents are fungi and bacteria. Antibiotic therapy was set based on the antibiogram, and marbofloxacin was chosen at a dosage of 10 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) once per day (SID). After only 7 days of antibiotic therapy, the clinical condition improved significantly; the patient started feeding and drinking spontaneously and gained weight. This case should remind clinicians of the importance of always performing antibiograms before choosing any antibiotic therapy. Considering reptiles, there have been few papers about spinal diseases, mostly regarding snakes and a few about Iguana iguana. Relative to other species of saurians, the literature remains lacking.

"The influence of climate change on wildlife disease dynamics is a burgeoning conservation and human health issue, but few long-term studies empirically link climate to pathogen prevalence. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are vulnerable to the negative impacts of sea ice loss as a result of accelerated Arctic warming. While studies have associated changes in polar bear body condition, reproductive output, survival, and abundance to reductions in sea ice, no long-term studies have documented the impact of climate change on pathogen exposure. We examined 425 serum samples from 381 adult polar bears, collected in western Hudson Bay (WH), Canada, for antibodies to selected pathogens across three time periods: 1986-1989 (n = 157), 1995-1998 (n = 159) and 2015-2017 (n = 109). We ran serological assays for antibodies to seven pathogens: Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Trichinella spp., Francisella tularensis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine morbillivirus (CDV) and canine parvovirus (CPV). Seroprevalence of zoonotic parasites (T. gondii, Trichinella spp.) and bacterial pathogens (F. tularensis, B. bronchiseptica) increased significantly between 1986-1989 and 1995-1998, ranging from +6.2% to +20.8%, with T. gondii continuing to increase into 2015-2017 (+25.8% overall). Seroprevalence of viral pathogens (CDV, CPV) and N. caninum did not change with time. Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence was higher following wetter summers, while seroprevalences of Trichinella spp. and B. bronchiseptica were positively correlated with hotter summers. Seroprevalence of antibodies to F. tularensis increased following years polar bears spent more days on land, and polar bears previously captured in human settlements were more likely to be seropositive for Trichinella spp. As the Arctic has warmed due to climate change, zoonotic pathogen exposure in WH polar bears has increased, driven by numerous altered ecosystem pathways.

"BACKGROUND: Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) developed as anti-cancer drugs, also have anti-viral activity due to their ability to disrupt productive replication and dissemination in infected cells. Consequently, such drugs are attractive candidates for ""repurposing"" as anti-viral agents. However, clinical evaluation of therapeutics against infectious agents associated with high mortality, but low or infrequent incidence, is often unfeasible. The United States Food and Drug Administration formulated the ""Animal Rule"" to facilitate use of validated animal models for conducting anti-viral efficacy studies. METHODS: To enable such efficacy studies of two clinically approved TKIs, nilotinib, and imatinib, we first conducted comprehensive pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in relevant rodent and non-rodent animal models. PK of these agents following intravenous and oral dosing were evaluated in C57BL/6 mice, prairie dogs, guinea pigs and Cynomolgus monkeys. Plasma samples were analyzed using an LC-MS/MS method. Secondarily, we evaluated the utility of allometry-based inter-species scaling derived from previously published data to predict the PK parameters, systemic clearance (CL) and the steady state volume of distribution (Vss) of these two drugs in prairie dogs, an animal model not tested thus far. RESULTS: Marked inter-species variability in PK parameters and resulting oral bioavailability was observed. In general, elimination half-lives of these agents in mice and guinea pigs were much shorter (1-3 h) relative to those in larger species such as prairie dogs and monkeys. The longer nilotinib elimination half-life in prairie dogs (i.v., 6.5 h and oral, 7.5 h), facilitated multiple dosing PK and safety assessment. The allometry-based predicted values of the Vss and CL were within 2.0 and 2.5-fold, respectively, of the observed values. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prairie dogs and monkeys may be suitable rodent and non-rodent species to perform further efficacy testing of these TKIs against orthopoxvirus infections. The use of rodent models such as C57BL/6 mice and guinea pigs for assessing pre-clinical anti-viral efficacy of these two TKIs may be limited due to short elimination and/or low oral bioavailability. Allometry-based correlations, derived from existing literature data, may provide initial estimates, which may serve as a useful guide for pre-clinical PK studies in untested animal models.

"Decades after public health interventions - including pre- and post-exposure vaccination - were used to eradicate smallpox, zoonotic orthopoxvirus outbreaks and the potential threat of a release of variola virus remain public health concerns. Routine prophylactic smallpox vaccination of the public ceased worldwide in 1980, and the adverse event rate associated with the currently licensed live vaccinia virus vaccine makes reinstatement of policies recommending routine pre-exposure vaccination unlikely in the absence of an orthopoxvirus outbreak. Consequently, licensing of safer vaccines and therapeutics that can be used post-orthopoxvirus exposure is necessary to protect the global population from these threats. Variola virus is a solely human pathogen that does not naturally infect any other known animal species. Therefore, the use of surrogate viruses in animal models of orthopoxvirus infection is important for the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics. Major complications involved with the use of surrogate models include both the absence of a model that accurately mimics all aspects of human smallpox disease and a lack of reproducibility across model species. These complications limit our ability to model post-exposure vaccination with newer vaccines for application to human orthopoxvirus outbreaks. This review seeks to (1) summarize conclusions about the efficacy of post-exposure smallpox vaccination from historic epidemiological reports and modern animal studies; (2) identify data gaps in these studies; and (3) summarize the clinical features of orthopoxvirus-associated infections in various animal models to identify those models that are most useful for post-exposure vaccination studies. The ultimate purpose of this review is to provide observations and comments regarding available model systems and data gaps for use in improving post-exposure medical countermeasures against orthopoxviruses.

"Whole-genome amplification (WGA) is a useful tool for amplification of very small quantities of DNA for many uses, including metagenomic shotgun sequencing for infection diagnosis. Depending on the application, background DNA from WGA kits can be problematic. Three WGA kits were tested for their utility in a metagenomics approach to identify the pathogens in sonicate fluid comprised of biofilms and other materials dislodged from the surfaces of explanted prosthetic joints using sonication. The Illustra V2 Genomiphi, Illustra single cell Genomiphi, and Qiagen REPLI-g single cell kits were used to test identical sonicate fluid samples. Variations in the number of background reads, the genera identified in the background, and the number of reads from known pathogens known to be present in the samples were observed between kits. These results were then compared to those obtained with a library preparation without prior WGA using an NEBNext Ultra II paired-end kit, which requires a very small amount of input DNA. This approach also resulted in the presence of contaminant bacterial DNA and yielded fewer reads from the known pathogens. These findings highlight the impact that WGA kit selection can have on metagenomic analysis of low-biomass samples and the importance of the careful selection and consideration of the implications of using these tools.

"We report that patterns of nonneutral DNA sequence evolution among published nuclear and mitochondrially encoded protein-coding loci differ significantly in animals. Whereas an apparent excess of amino acid polymorphism is seen in most (25/31) mitochondrial genes, this pattern is seen in fewer than half (15/36) of the nuclear data sets. This differentiation is even greater among data sets with significant departures from neutrality (14/15 vs. 1/6). Using forward simulations, we examined patterns of nonneutral evolution using parameters chosen to mimic the differences between mitochondrial and nuclear genetics (we varied recombination rate, population size, mutation rate, selective dominance, and intensity of germ line bottleneck). Patterns of evolution were correlated only with effective population size and strength of selection, and no single genetic factor explains the empirical contrast in patterns. We further report that in Arabidopsis thaliana, a highly self-fertilizing plant with effectively low recombination, five of six published nuclear data sets also exhibit an excess of amino acid polymorphism. We suggest that the contrast between nuclear and mitochondrial nonneutrality in animals stems from differences in rates of recombination in conjunction with a distribution of selective effects. If the majority of mutations segregating in populations are deleterious, high linkage may hinder the spread of the occasional beneficial mutation.

"BACKGROUND: Medical writing styles can have an impact on the understandability of health educational resources. Amid current web-based health information research, there is a dearth of research-based evidence that demonstrates what constitutes the best practice of the development of web-based health resources on children's health promotion and education. OBJECTIVE: Using authoritative and highly influential web-based children's health educational resources from the Nemours Foundation, the largest not-for-profit organization promoting children's health and well-being, we aimed to develop machine learning algorithms to discriminate and predict the writing styles of health educational resources on children versus adult health promotion using a variety of health educational resources aimed at the general public. METHODS: The selection of natural language features as predicator variables of algorithms went through initial automatic feature selection using ridge classifier, support vector machine, extreme gradient boost tree, and recursive feature elimination followed by revision by education experts. We compared algorithms using the automatically selected (n=19) and linguistically enhanced (n=20) feature sets, using the initial feature set (n=115) as the baseline. RESULTS: Using five-fold cross-validation, compared with the baseline (115 features), the Gaussian Naive Bayes model (20 features) achieved statistically higher mean sensitivity (P=.02; 95% CI -0.016 to 0.1929), mean specificity (P=.02; 95% CI -0.016 to 0.199), mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (P=.02; 95% CI -0.007 to 0.140), and mean macro F1 (P=.006; 95% CI 0.016-0.167). The statistically improved performance of the final model (20 features) is in contrast to the statistically insignificant changes between the original feature set (n=115) and the automatically selected features (n=19): mean sensitivity (P=.13; 95% CI -0.1699 to 0.0681), mean specificity (P=.10; 95% CI -0.1389 to 0.4017), mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (P=.008; 95% CI 0.0059-0.1126), and mean macro F1 (P=.98; 95% CI -0.0555 to 0.0548). This demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of combining automatic feature selection and expert-based linguistic revision to develop the most effective machine learning algorithms from high-dimensional data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We developed new evaluation tools for the discrimination and prediction of writing styles of web-based health resources for children's health education and promotion among parents and caregivers of children. User-adaptive automatic assessment of web-based health content holds great promise for distant and remote health education among young readers. Our study leveraged the precision and adaptability of machine learning algorithms and insights from health linguistics to help advance this significant yet understudied area of research.

"A dearth of information obscures the true scale of the global illegal trade in wildlife. Herein, we introduce an automated web crawling surveillance system developed to monitor reports on illegally traded wildlife. A resource for enforcement officials as well as the general public, the freely available website, http://www.healthmap.org/wildlifetrade, provides a customizable visualization of worldwide reports on interceptions of illegally traded wildlife and wildlife products. From August 1, 2010 to July 31, 2011, publicly available English language illegal wildlife trade reports from official and unofficial sources were collected and categorized by location and species involved. During this interval, 858 illegal wildlife trade reports were collected from 89 countries. Countries with the highest number of reports included India (n = 146, 15.6%), the United States (n = 143, 15.3%), South Africa (n = 75, 8.0%), China (n = 41, 4.4%), and Vietnam (n = 37, 4.0%). Species reported as traded or poached included elephants (n = 107, 12.5%), rhinoceros (n = 103, 12.0%), tigers (n = 68, 7.9%), leopards (n = 54, 6.3%), and pangolins (n = 45, 5.2%). The use of unofficial data sources, such as online news sites and social networks, to collect information on international wildlife trade augments traditional approaches drawing on official reporting and presents a novel source of intelligence with which to monitor and collect news in support of enforcement against this threat to wildlife conservation worldwide.

"We investigated Bacteroidetes during spring algae blooms in the southern North Sea in 2010-2012 using a time series of 38 deeply sequenced metagenomes. Initial partitioning yielded 6455 bins, from which we extracted 3101 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) including 1286 Bacteroidetes MAGs covering ~120 mostly uncultivated species. We identified 13 dominant, recurrent Bacteroidetes clades carrying a restricted set of conserved polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that likely mediate the bulk of bacteroidetal algal polysaccharide degradation. The majority of PULs were predicted to target the diatom storage polysaccharide laminarin, alpha-glucans, alpha-mannose-rich substrates, and sulfated xylans. Metaproteomics at 14 selected points in time revealed expression of SusC-like proteins from PULs targeting all of these substrates. Analyses of abundant key players and their PUL repertoires over time furthermore suggested that fewer and simpler polysaccharides dominated early bloom stages, and that more complex polysaccharides became available as blooms progressed.

"Biological invasions are a global consequence of an increasingly connected world and the rise in human population size. The numbers of invasive alien species - the subset of alien species that spread widely in areas where they are not native, affecting the environment or human livelihoods - are increasing. Synergies with other global changes are exacerbating current invasions and facilitating new ones, thereby escalating the extent and impacts of invaders. Invasions have complex and often immense long-term direct and indirect impacts. In many cases, such impacts become apparent or problematic only when invaders are well established and have large ranges. Invasive alien species break down biogeographic realms, affect native species richness and abundance, increase the risk of native species extinction, affect the genetic composition of native populations, change native animal behaviour, alter phylogenetic diversity across communities, and modify trophic networks. Many invasive alien species also change ecosystem functioning and the delivery of ecosystem services by altering nutrient and contaminant cycling, hydrology, habitat structure, and disturbance regimes. These biodiversity and ecosystem impacts are accelerating and will increase further in the future. Scientific evidence has identified policy strategies to reduce future invasions, but these strategies are often insufficiently implemented. For some nations, notably Australia and New Zealand, biosecurity has become a national priority. There have been long-term successes, such as eradication of rats and cats on increasingly large islands and biological control of weeds across continental areas. However, in many countries, invasions receive little attention. Improved international cooperation is crucial to reduce the impacts of invasive alien species on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and human livelihoods. Countries can strengthen their biosecurity regulations to implement and enforce more effective management strategies that should also address other global changes that interact with invasions.

"The mosquito Aedes aegypti, the dengue virus vector, has spread throughout the tropics in historical times. While this suggests man-mediated dispersal, estimating contemporary connectivity among populations has remained elusive. Here, we use a large mtDNA dataset and a Bayesian coalescent framework to test a set of hypotheses about gene flow among American Ae. aegypti populations. We assessed gene flow patterns at the continental and subregional (Amazon basin) scales. For the Americas, our data favor a stepping-stone model in which gene flow is higher among adjacent populations but in which, at the same time, North American and southeastern Brazilian populations are directly connected, likely via sea trade. Within Amazonia, the model with highest support suggests extensive gene flow among major cities; Manaus, located at the center of the subregional transport network, emerges as a potentially important connecting hub. Our results suggest substantial connectivity across Ae. aegypti populations in the Americas. As long-distance active dispersal has not been observed in this species, our data support man-mediated dispersal as a major determinant of the genetic structure of American Ae. aegypti populations. The inferred topology of interpopulation connectivity can inform network models of Ae. aegypti and dengue spread.

"West Nile virus (WNV) is an important zoonotic flavivirus responsible for mild fever to severe, lethal neuroinvasive disease in humans, horses, birds, and other wildlife species. Since its discovery, WNV has caused multiple human and animal disease outbreaks in all continents, except Antarctica. Infections are associated with economic losses, mainly due to the cost of treatment of infected patients, control programmes, and loss of animals and animal products. The pathogenesis of WNV has been extensively investigated in natural hosts as well as in several animal models, including rodents, lagomorphs, birds, and reptiles. However, most of the proposed pathogenesis hypotheses remain contentious, and much remains to be elucidated. At the same time, the unavailability of specific antiviral treatment or effective and safe vaccines contribute to the perpetuation of the disease and regular occurrence of outbreaks in both endemic and non-endemic areas. Moreover, globalisation and climate change are also important drivers of the emergence and re-emergence of the virus and disease. Here, we give an update of the pathobiology, epidemiology, diagnostics, control, and ""One Health"" implications of WNV infection and disease.

"BACKGROUND: As an invasive mosquito species in the United States, Aedes albopictus is a potential vector of arboviruses including dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, and may also be involved in occasional transmission of other arboviruses such as West Nile, Saint Louis encephalitis, eastern equine encephalitis, and La Crosse viruses. Aedes albopictus feeds on a wide variety of vertebrate hosts, wild and domestic, as well as humans. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to investigate blood feeding patterns of Ae. albopictus, engorged specimens were collected from a variety of habitat types using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps, Biogents Sentinel 2 traps, and modified Reiter gravid traps in southeast Virginia. Sources of blood meals were determined by the analysis of mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences amplified in PCR assays. Our aims were to quantify degrees of Ae. albopictus interactions with vertebrate hosts as sources of blood meals, investigate arboviral infection status, assess the influence of key socioecological conditions on spatial variability in blood feeding, and investigate temporal differences in blood feeding by season. Analysis of 961 engorged specimens of Ae. albopictus sampled between 2017-2019 indicated that 96%, 4%, and less than 1% obtained blood meals from mammalian, reptilian, and avian hosts, respectively. Domestic cats were the most frequently identified (50.5%) hosts followed by Virginia opossums (17.1%), white-tailed deer (12.2%), and humans (7.3%), together representing 87.1% of all identified blood hosts. We found spatial patterns in blood feeding linked to socioecological conditions and seasonal shifts in Ae. albopictus blood feeding with implications for understanding human biting and disease risk. In Suffolk Virginia in areas of lower human development, the likelihood of human blood feeding increased as median household income increased and human blood feeding was more likely early in the season (May-June) compared to later (July-October). Screening of the head and thorax of engorged Ae. albopictus mosquitoes by cell culture and RT-PCR resulted in a single isolate of Potosi virus. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Understanding mosquito-host interactions in nature is vital for evaluating vectorial capacity of mosquitoes. These interactions with competent reservoir hosts support transmission, maintenance, and amplification of zoonotic agents of human diseases. Results of our study in conjunction with abundance in urban/suburban settings, virus isolation from field-collected mosquitoes, and vector competence of Ae. albopictus, highlight the potential involvement of this species in the transmission of a number of arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika to humans. Limited interaction with avian hosts suggests that Ae. albopictus is unlikely to serve as a bridge vector of arboviruses such as West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis in the study region, but that possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.

"Giardia duodenalis (syn. Giardia lamblia, Giardia intestinalis) is the causative agent of giardiasis, one of the most common diarrheal infections in humans. Evolutionary relationships among G. duodenalis genotypes (or subtypes) of assemblage B, one of two genetic assemblages causing the majority of human infections, remain unclear due to poor phylogenetic resolution of current typing methods. In this study, we devised a methodology to identify new markers for a streamlined multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on comparisons of all core genes against the phylogeny of whole-genome sequences (WGS). Our analysis identified three markers with resolution comparable to that of WGS data. Using newly designed PCR primers for our novel MLST loci, we typed an additional 68 strains of assemblage B. Analyses of these strains and previously determined genome sequences showed that genomes of this assemblage can be assigned to 16 clonal complexes, each with unique gene content that is apparently tuned to differential virulence and ecology. Obtaining new genomes of Giardia spp. and other eukaryotic microbial pathogens remains challenging due to difficulties in culturing the parasites in the laboratory. Hence, the methods described here are expected to be widely applicable to other pathogens of interest and advance our understanding of their ecology and evolution.IMPORTANCE Giardia duodenalis assemblage B is a major waterborne pathogen and the most commonly identified genotype causing human giardiasis worldwide. The lack of morphological characters for classification requires the use of molecular techniques for strain differentiation; however, the absence of scalable and affordable next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based typing methods has prevented meaningful advancements in high-resolution molecular typing for further understanding of the evolution and epidemiology of assemblage B. Prior studies have reported high sequence diversity but low phylogenetic resolution at standard loci in assemblage B, highlighting the necessity of identifying new markers for accurate and robust molecular typing. Data from comparative analyses of available genomes in this study identified three loci that together form a novel high-resolution typing scheme with high concordance to whole-genome-based phylogenomics and which should aid in future public health endeavors related to this parasite. In addition, data from newly characterized strains suggest evidence of biogeographic and ecologic endemism.

"Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease widely distributed throughout the world, infecting a wide variety of animal species including humans. In Mexico, this parasite has been detected in different parts of the country, particularly in the tropical areas where the parasite can remain infective for long periods of time due to the environmental conditions (i.e. high temperature and humidity over the whole year). Several epidemiological studies have been conducted in both human and animal populations, but despite the wide distribution of the agent in the country, there is a significant lack of knowledge on the parasite transmission, treatment alternatives and control measures. The lack of feral cat populations and control measures in sites of meat production for human consumption are playing a role that has led to the wide spread of the disease in the country, particularly in tropical areas of Southeastern Mexico. For these reasons, this manuscript aims to review the published information on relevant epidemiological aspects of infection with T. gondii in humans and animals from Mexico.

"Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV) is a tick-borne flavivirus classified as a biosafety level-4 (BSL4) pathogen. Studies of OHFV are restricted to be conducted within BSL4 laboratories. Currently, no commercial vaccines or antiviral drugs are available against OHFV infection. In this study, we recovered a replication-deficient OHFV with an NS1 deletion (OHFV-ΔNS1) and reporter virus replacing NS1 with the Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) (OHFV-ΔNS1-Gluc). Both the defective OHFV-ΔNS1 and OHFV-ΔNS1-Gluc virus could only replicate efficiently in the BHK21 cell line expressing NS1 (BHK21(NS1)) but not in naïve BHK21 cells. The Gluc reporter gene of OHFV-ΔNS1-Gluc virus was maintained stably after serial passaging of BHK21(NS1) cells and was used to surrogate the replication of OHFV. Using NITD008, OHFV-ΔNS1-Gluc virus was validated for antiviral screening, and high-throughput screening parameters were optimized in a 96-well plate format with a calculated Z' value above 0.5. The OHFV-ΔNS1-Gluc reporter virus is a powerful tool for antiviral screening as well as viral replication and pathogenesis studies in BSL2 laboratories.

"BACKGROUND: Over 60 % of human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic, and there is growing evidence of the zooanthroponotic transmission of diseases from humans to livestock and wildlife species, with major implications for public health, economics, and conservation. Zooanthroponoses are of relevance to critically endangered species; amongst these is the mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) of Uganda. Here, we assess the occurrence of Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Giardia, and Entamoeba infecting mountain gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda, using molecular methods. We also assess the occurrence of these parasites in humans and livestock species living in overlapping/adjacent geographical regions. RESULTS: Diagnostic PCR detected Cryptosporidium parvum in one sample from a mountain gorilla (IIdA23G2) and one from a goat (based on SSU). Cryptosporidium was not detected in humans or cattle. Cyclospora was not detected in any of the samples analysed. Giardia was identified in three human and two cattle samples, which were linked to assemblage A, B and E of G. duodenalis. Sequences defined as belonging to the genus Entamoeba were identified in all host groups. Of the 86 sequence types characterised, one, seven and two have been recorded previously to represent genotypes of Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Entamoeba, respectively, from humans, other mammals, and water sources globally. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a snapshot of the occurrence and genetic make-up of selected protists in mammals in and around BINP. The genetic analyses indicated that 54.6% of the 203 samples analysed contained parasites that matched species, genotypes, or genetic assemblages found globally. Seventy-six new sequence records were identified here for the first time. As nothing is known about the zoonotic/zooanthroponotic potential of the corresponding parasites, future work should focus on wider epidemiological investigations together with continued surveillance of all parasites in humans, other mammals, the environment, and water in this highly impoverished area.

"In this study we assessed the level of genetic introgression between red foxes bred on fur farms in Poland and the native wild population. We also evaluated the impact of a geographic barrier and isolation by distance on gene flow between two isolated subpopulations of the native red fox and their genetic differentiation. Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA was collected from a total of 308 individuals (200 farm and 108 wild red foxes) to study non-native allele flow from farm into wild red fox populations. Genetic structure analyses performed using 24 autosomal microsatellites showed two genetic clusters as being the most probable number of distinct populations. No strong admixture signals between farm and wild red foxes were detected, and significant genetic differentiation was identified between the two groups. This was also apparent from the mtDNA analysis. None of the concatenated haplotypes detected in farm foxes was found in wild animals. The consequence of this was that the haplotype network displayed two genetically distinct groups: farm foxes were completely separated from native ones. Neither the River Vistula nor isolation by distance had a significant impact on gene flow between the separated wild red fox subpopulations. The results of our research indicate a low probability of genetic introgression between farm and native red foxes, and no threat to the genetic integrity of this species.

"The greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) is an invasive mammalian species that was first recorded in Ireland in 2007. It currently occupies an area of approximately 7,600 km2 on the island. C. russula is normally distributed in Northern Africa and Western Europe, and was previously absent from the British Isles. Whilst invasive species can have dramatic and rapid impacts on faunal and floral communities, they may also be carriers of pathogens facilitating disease transmission in potentially naive populations. Pathogenic leptospires are endemic in Ireland and a significant cause of human and animal disease. From 18 trapped C. russula, 3 isolates of Leptospira were cultured. However, typing of these isolates by standard serological reference methods was negative, and suggested an, as yet, unidentified serovar. Sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA and secY indicated that these novel isolates belong to Leptospira alstonii, a unique pathogenic species of which only 7 isolates have been described to date. Earlier isolations were limited geographically to China, Japan and Malaysia, and this leptospiral species had not previously been cultured from mammals. Restriction enzyme analysis (REA) further confirms the novelty of these strains since no similar patterns were observed with a reference database of leptospires. As with other pathogenic Leptospira species, these isolates contain lipL32 and do not grow in the presence of 8-azagunaine; however no evidence of disease was apparent after experimental infection of hamsters. These isolates are genetically related to L. alstonii but have a novel REA pattern; they represent a new serovar which we designate as serovar Room22. This study demonstrates that invasive mammalian species act as bridge vectors of novel zoonotic pathogens such as Leptospira.

"The dorsal striatum has two functionally-defined subdivisions: a dorsomedial striatum (DMS) region involved in mediating goal-directed behaviors that require conscious effort, and a dorsolateral striatum (DLS) region involved in the execution of habitual behaviors in a familiar sensory context. Consistent with its presumed role in forming stimulus-response (S-R) associations, neurons in DLS receive massive inputs from sensorimotor cortex and are responsive to both active and passive sensory stimulation. While several studies have established that corticostriatal inputs contribute to the stimulus-induced responses observed in the DLS, there is growing awareness that the thalamus has a significant role in conveying sensory-related information to DLS and other parts of the striatum. The thalamostriatal projections to DLS originate mainly from the caudal intralaminar region, which contains the parafascicular (Pf) nucleus, and from higher-order thalamic nuclei such as the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Based on recent findings, we hypothesize that the thalamostriatal projections from these two regions exert opposing influences on the expression of behavioral habits. This article reviews the subcortical circuits that regulate the transmission of sensory information through these thalamostriatal projection systems, and describes the evidence that indicates these circuits could be manipulated to ameliorate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and related neurological disorders.

"Periodontal and Endodontic diseases are biofilm-related diseases. The presence of microorganisms in root canals (RCs) and the complex microbiota of periodontal pockets (PPs) contribute to the development of endodontic-periodontal diseases. This study performed a systemic analysis using state-of-the-art sequence data to assess the microbial composition of infected RCs and PPs to further assess the microbiota and verify the possibility of cross-infection between these sites. The microbiomes of these combined diseases were examined with a focus on the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. The number of species in PP was higher than in RC, and there was a predominance of obligate anaerobes and gram-negative bacteria. In the RCs, the genera Enterococcus, Parvimonas, Stomatobaculum predominated, in contrast, the PPs revealed a predominance of Enterococcus, Parvimonas, Stomatobaculum, Peptostreptococcus and Mogibacterium. The RC and PP microbiome was not similar with regards to the sharing of OTUs for phyla and genera (8 and 67, respectively). The evaluation of molecular markers revealed a large number of markers for resistance to antibiotics of the carbapenem and beta-lactam type (broad spectrum). Another relevant finding of this study was the markers related to systemic diseases related to cardiac muscle and rheumatology, among others. In conclusion, the RC microbiota was less complex and diverse than PP. Interactions between microbial communities were present. The shared genus can signal communication between the endodontic and periodontal microbiomes.

"A wide range of viruses from different virus families in different geographical areas, may cause immediate or delayed neuropathological changes and neurological manifestations in humans and animals. Infection by neurotropic viruses as well as the resulting immune response can irreversibly disrupt the complex structural and functional architecture of the central nervous system, frequently leaving the patient or affected animal with a poor or fatal prognosis. Mechanisms that govern neuropathogenesis and immunopathogenesis of viral infections are highlighted, using examples of well-studied virus infections that are associated with these alterations in different populations throughout the world. A better understanding of the molecular, epidemiological and biological characteristics of these infections and in particular of mechanisms that underlie their clinical manifestations may be expected to provide tools for the development of more effective intervention strategies and treatment regimens.

"Ticks are the major vectors of most disease-causing agents to humans, companion animals and wildlife. Moreover, ticks transmit a greater variety of pathogenic agents than any other blood-feeding arthropod. Ticks have been expanding their geographic ranges in recent decades largely due to climate change. Furthermore, tick populations in many areas of their past and even newly established localities have increased in abundance. These dynamic changes present new and increasing severe public health threats to humans, livestock and companion animals in areas where they were previously unknown or were considered to be of minor importance. Here in this review, the geographic status of four representative tick species are discussed in relation to these public health concerns, namely, the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, the Gulf Coast Tick, Amblyomma maculatum and the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis. Both biotic and abiotic factors that may influence future range expansion and successful colony formation in new habitats are discussed.

"Avian bornaviral ganglioneuritis, often referred to as parrot wasting disease, is associated with a newly discovered avian virus from the taxonomic family Bornaviridae. Research regarding the pathogenesis and treatment for this disease is ongoing, with implications for understanding other emerging human and nonhuman diseases, as well as the health and ecology of wildlife. At this time, numerous questions remain unanswered regarding the transmission of the disease, best practices for diagnostic sampling and testing, and whether currently used drug therapies are effective or harmful for afflicted birds. The pathogenesis of the disease also remains unclear with many birds showing resistance to the effects of the virus and being able to remain clinically unaffected for years, while other birds succumb to its effects. New research findings regarding avian bornaviral ganglioneuritis are discussed and important as yet unanswered questions are identified.

"Pioneering studies by Per Scholander indicated that the diving response consists of reflexly induced apnea, bradycardia and an alteration of blood flow that maintains perfusion of the heart and brain. More recently field physiological studies have shown that many marine animals can adjust cardiorespiratory aspects of their diving response depending upon the behavioral situation. This could suggest that the very labile heart rate during diving is under direct cortical control. However, the final control of autonomic nervous system functioning resides within the brainstem and not the cortex. Many physiologists regard the brain as a ""black box"" where important neuronal functioning occurs, but the complexity of such functioning leaves systematic investigation a daunting task. As a consequence the central control of the diving response has been under-investigated. Thus, to further advance the field of diving physiology by understanding its central neuronal control, it would be first necessary to understand the reflex circuitry that exists within the brainstem of diving animals. To do this will require an appropriate animal model. In this review, two animals, the muskrat and rat, will be offered as animal models to investigate the central aspects of the diving response. Firstly, although these rodents are not marine animals, natural histories indicate that both animals can and do exploit aquatic environments. Secondly, physiological recordings during natural and simulated diving indicate that both animals possess the same basic physiological responses to underwater submersion that occur in marine animals. Thirdly, the size and ease of housing of both animals makes them attractive laboratory research animals. Finally, the enormous amount of scientific literature regarding rodent brainstem autonomic control mechanisms, and the availability of brain atlases, makes these animals ideal choices to study the central control of the mammalian diving response.

"A well-defined granular layer 4 is a defining cytoarchitectonic feature associated with sensory areas of mammalian cerebral cortex, and one with hodological significance: the local axons ascending from cells in thalamorecipient layer 4 and connecting to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons form a major feedforward excitatory interlaminar projection. Conversely, agranular cortical areas, lacking a distinct layer 4, pose a hodological conundrum: without a laminar basis for the canonical layer 4-->2/3 pathway, what is the basic circuit organization? This review highlights current challenges and prospects for local-circuit electroanatomy and electrophysiology in agranular cortex, focusing on the mouse. Different lines of evidence, drawn primarily from studies of motor areas in frontal cortex in rodents, support the view that synaptic circuits in agranular cortex are organized around prominent descending excitatory layer 2/3-->5 pathways targeting multiple classes of projection neurons.

"In this study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic profiles of meloxicam and sustained-release (SR) buprenorphine in prairie dogs. The 4 treatment groups were: low-dose meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg SC), high-dose meloxicam (4 mg/kg SC), low-dose buprenorphine SR (0.9 mg/kg SC), and high-dose buprenorphine SR (1.2 mg/kg SC). The highest plasma concentrations occurred within 4 h of administration for both meloxicam treatment groups. The therapeutic range of meloxicam in prairie dogs is currently unknown. However, as compared with the therapeutic range documented in other species (0.39 - 0.91 μg/mL), the mean plasma concentration of meloxicam fell below the minimal therapeutic range prior to 24 h in the low-dose group but remained above therapeutic levels for more than 72 h in the high-dose group. These findings suggest that the current meloxicam dosing guidelines may be subtherapeutic for prairie dogs. The highest mean plasma concentration for buprenorphine SR occurred at the 24-h time point (0.0098 μg/mL) in the low-dose group and at the 8-h time point (0.015 μg/mL) for the high-dose group. Both dosages of buprenorphine SR maintained likely plasma therapeutic levels (0.001 μg/mL, based on previous rodent studies) beyond 72 h. Given the small scale of the study and sample size, statistical analysis was not performed. The only adverse reactions in this study were mild erythematous reactions at injection sites for buprenorphine SR.

"Invasive species are among the major driving forces behind biodiversity loss. Gene drive technology may offer a humane, efficient and cost-effective method of control. For safe and effective deployment it is vital that a gene drive is both self-limiting and can overcome evolutionary resistance. We present HD-ClvR in this modelling study, a novel combination of CRISPR-based gene drives that eliminates resistance and localises spread. As a case study, we model HD-ClvR in the grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), which is an invasive pest in the UK and responsible for both biodiversity and economic losses. HD-ClvR combats resistance allele formation by combining a homing gene drive with a cleave-and-rescue gene drive. The inclusion of a self-limiting daisyfield gene drive allows for controllable localisation based on animal supplementation. We use both randomly mating and spatial models to simulate this strategy. Our findings show that HD-ClvR could effectively control a targeted grey squirrel population, with little risk to other populations. HD-ClvR offers an efficient, self-limiting and controllable gene drive for managing invasive pests.

"The prevalence and intensity of parasites in wild hosts varies across space and is a key determinant of infection risk in humans, domestic animals and threatened wildlife. Because the immune system serves as the primary barrier to infection, replication and transmission following exposure, we here consider the environmental drivers of immunity. Spatial variation in parasite pressure, abiotic and biotic conditions, and anthropogenic factors can all shape immunity across spatial scales. Identifying the most important spatial drivers of immunity could help pre-empt infectious disease risks, especially in the context of how large-scale factors such as urbanization affect defence by changing environmental conditions. We provide a synthesis of how to apply macroecological approaches to the study of ecoimmunology (i.e. macroimmunology). We first review spatial factors that could generate spatial variation in defence, highlighting the need for large-scale studies that can differentiate competing environmental predictors of immunity and detailing contexts where this approach might be favoured over small-scale experimental studies. We next conduct a systematic review of the literature to assess the frequency of spatial studies and to classify them according to taxa, immune measures, spatial replication and extent, and statistical methods. We review 210 ecoimmunology studies sampling multiple host populations. We show that whereas spatial approaches are relatively common, spatial replication is generally low and unlikely to provide sufficient environmental variation or power to differentiate competing spatial hypotheses. We also highlight statistical biases in macroimmunology, in that few studies characterize and account for spatial dependence statistically, potentially affecting inferences for the relationships between environmental conditions and immune defence. We use these findings to describe tools from geostatistics and spatial modelling that can improve inference about the associations between environmental and immunological variation. In particular, we emphasize exploratory tools that can guide spatial sampling and highlight the need for greater use of mixed-effects models that account for spatial variability while also allowing researchers to account for both individual- and habitat-level covariates. We finally discuss future research priorities for macroimmunology, including focusing on latitudinal gradients, range expansions and urbanization as being especially amenable to large-scale spatial approaches. Methodologically, we highlight critical opportunities posed by assessing spatial variation in host tolerance, using metagenomics to quantify spatial variation in parasite pressure, coupling large-scale field studies with small-scale field experiments and longitudinal approaches, and applying statistical tools from macroecology and meta-analysis to identify generalizable spatial patterns. Such work will facilitate scaling ecoimmunology from individual- to habitat-level insights about the drivers of immune defence and help predict where environmental change may most alter infectious disease risk.

"The picornavirus named 'Ljungan virus' (LV, species Parechovirus B) has been detected in a dozen small mammal species from across Europe, but detailed information on its genetic diversity and host specificity is lacking. Here, we analyze the evolutionary relationships of LV variants circulating in free-living mammal populations by comparing the phylogenetics of the VP1 region (encoding the capsid protein and associated with LV serotype) and the 3D(pol) region (encoding the RNA polymerase) from 24 LV RNA-positive animals and a fragment of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) sequence (used for defining strains) in sympatric small mammals. We define three new VP1 genotypes: two in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) (genotype 8 from Finland, Sweden, France, and Italy, and genotype 9 from France and Italy) and one in field voles (Microtus arvalis) (genotype 7 from Finland). There are several other indications that LV variants are host-specific, at least in parts of their range. Our results suggest that LV evolution is rapid, ongoing and affected by genetic drift, purifying selection, spillover and host evolutionary history. Although recent studies suggest that LV does not have zoonotic potential, its widespread geographical and host distribution in natural populations of well-characterized small mammals could make it useful as a model for studying RNA virus evolution and transmission.

"BACKGROUND: A series of Rps (resistance to Pytophthora sojae) genes have been protecting soybean from the root and stem rot disease caused by the Oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora sojae. Five Rps genes were mapped to the Rps1 locus located near the 28 cM map position on molecular linkage group N of the composite genetic soybean map. Among these five genes, Rps1-k was introgressed from the cultivar, Kingwa. Rps1-k has been providing stable and broad-spectrum Phytophthora resistance in the major soybean-producing regions of the United States. Rps1-k has been mapped and isolated. More than one functional Rps1-k gene was identified from the Rps1-k locus. The clustering feature at the Rps1-k locus might have facilitated the expansion of Rps1-k gene numbers and the generation of new recognition specificities. The Rps1-k region was sequenced to understand the possible evolutionary steps that shaped the generation of Phytophthora resistance genes in soybean. RESULTS: Here the analyses of sequences of three overlapping BAC clones containing the 184,111 bp Rps1-k region are reported. A shotgun sequencing strategy was applied in sequencing the BAC contig. Sequence analysis predicted a few full-length genes including two Rps1-k genes, Rps1-k-1 and Rps1-k-2. Previously reported Rps1-k-3 from this genomic region 1 was evolved through intramolecular recombination between Rps1-k-1 and Rps1-k-2 in Escherichia coli. The majority of the predicted genes are truncated and therefore most likely they are nonfunctional. A member of a highly abundant retroelement, SIRE1, was identified from the Rps1-k region. The Rps1-k region is primarily composed of repetitive sequences. Sixteen simple repeat and 63 tandem repeat sequences were identified from the locus. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the Rps1 locus is located in a gene-poor region. The abundance of repetitive sequences in the Rps1-k region suggested that the location of this locus is in or near a heterochromatic region. Poor recombination frequencies combined with presence of two functional Rps genes at this locus has been providing stable Phytophthora resistance in soybean.

"This review focuses on the immunization of animals as a means of preventing human diseases (zoonoses). Three frameworks for the use of vaccines in this context are described, and examples are provided of successes and failures. Framework I vaccines are used for protection of humans and economically valuable animals, where neither plays a role in the transmission cycle. The benefit of collaborations between animal health and human health industries and regulators in developing such products is discussed, and one example (West Nile vaccine) of a single product developed for use in animals and humans is described. Framework II vaccines are indicated for domesticated animals as a means of preventing disease in both animals and humans. The agents of concern are transmitted directly or indirectly (e.g. via arthropod vectors) from animals to humans. A number of examples of the use of Framework II vaccines are provided, e.g. against brucellosis, Escherichia coli O157, rabies, Rift Valley fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and Hendra virus. Framework III vaccines are used to immunize wild animals as a means of preventing transmission of disease agents to humans and domesticated animals. Examples are reservoir-targeted, oral bait rabies, Mycobacterium bovis and Lyme disease vaccines. Given the speed and lost cost of veterinary vaccine development, some interventions based on the immunization of animals could lead to rapid and relatively inexpensive advances in public health. Opportunities for vaccine-based approaches to preventing zoonotic and emerging diseases that integrate veterinary and human medicine (the One Health paradigm) are emphasized.

"Avian bornaviruses were first described in 2008 as the causative agents of proventricular dilatation disease (PDD) in parrots and their relatives (Psittaciformes). To date, 15 genetically highly diverse avian bornaviruses covering at least five viral species have been discovered in different bird orders. Currently, the primary diagnostic tool is the detection of viral RNA by conventional or real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR). One of the drawbacks of this is the usage of either specific assays, allowing the detection of one particular virus, or of assays with a broad detection spectrum, which, however, do not allow for the simultaneous specification of the detected virus. To facilitate the simultaneous detection and specification of avian bornaviruses, a multiplex real-time RT-PCR assay was developed. Whole-genome sequences of various bornaviruses were aligned. Primers were designed to recognize conserved regions within the overlapping X/P gene and probes were selected to detect virus species-specific regions within the target region. The optimization of the assay resulted in the sensitive and specific detection of bornaviruses of Psittaciformes, Passeriformes, and aquatic birds. Finally, the new rRT-PCR was successfully employed to detect avian bornaviruses in field samples from various avian species. This assay will serve as powerful tool in epidemiological studies and will improve avian bornavirus detection.

"Wild boar (Sus scrofa) population spread into urban and periurban areas has exacerbated conflicts with humans. There is a need for planned wild boar management strategies, and Population viability analysis (PVA) combined with perturbation analyses allow the assessment of the management effort of control methods. Our study aims to develop stochastic predictive models of the increasing wild boar population of the 80 km2 peri-urban Mediterranean area of Collserola Natural Park (CNP), located near Barcelona, Spain, as well as assessing specific management measures (including reduced food availability, selective harvest, and reduction in fertility). Population parameters were estimated from previously published census and hunting data provided by the CNP and the local hunting administration. The results revealed that under the current conditions the CNP wild boar population will continue to increase. The most efficient strategy to reduce wild boar abundance was a combination of reducing supplementary anthropogenic food resources and selective removal of juvenile (<1 year) and yearling (1-2 years) wild boar. These strategies will probably be also the most efficient ones in other oversupplemented increasing wild boar populations in similar situations, although specific studies will be needed to fine-tune the best management option for each context. PVA allows the prediction of future population trends and the assessment of the efficacy and efficiency of potential management strategies before implementing management measures.

"Arboviruses are emerging/reemerging infectious agents worldwide. The factors within this scenario include vector and host population fluctuations, climatic changes, anthropogenic activities that disturb ecosystems, an increase in international flights, human mobility, and genetic mutations that allow spill-over phenomenon. Arboviruses are maintained by biologic transmission among vectors and hosts. Sometimes this biological transmission is specific and includes one vector and host species such as Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV), and urban Yellow Fever (YFV). However, most of the arboviruses are generalist and they use many vectors and hosts species. From this perspective, arboviruses are maintained through a transmission network rather than a transmission cycle. This allows us to understand the complexity and dynamics of the transmission and maintenance of arboviruses in the ecosystems. The old perspective that arboviruses are maintained in close and stable transmission cycles should be modified by a new more integrative and dynamic idea, representing the real scenario where biological interactions have a much broader representation, indicating the constant adaptability of the biological entities.

"BACKGROUND: Rickettsia spp. are human pathogens that cause a number of diseases and are transmitted by arthropods, such as ixodid ticks. Estonia is one of few regions where the distribution area of two medically important tick species, Ixodes persulcatus and I. ricinus, overlaps. The nidicolous rodent-associated Ixodes trianguliceps has also recently been shown to be present in Estonia. Although no data are available on human disease(s) caused by tick-borne Rickettsia spp. in Estonia, the presence of three Rickettsia species in non-nidicolous ticks has been previously reported. The aim of this study was to detect, identify and partially characterize Rickettsia species in nidicolous and non-nidicolous ticks attached to rodents in Estonia. RESULTS: Larvae and nymphs of I. ricinus (n = 1004), I. persulcatus (n = 75) and I. trianguliceps (n = 117), all removed from rodents and shrews caught in different parts of Estonia, were studied for the presence of Rickettsia spp. by nested PCR. Ticks were collected from 314 small animals of five species [Myodes glareolus (bank voles), Apodemus flavicollis (yellow necked mice), A. agrarius (striped field mice), Microtus subterranius (pine voles) and Sorex araneus (common shrews)]. Rickettsial DNA was detected in 8.7% (103/1186) of the studied ticks. In addition to identifying R. helvetica, which had been previously found in questing ticks, we report here the first time that the recently described I. trianguliceps-associated Candidatus Rickettsia uralica has been identified west of the Ural Mountains.

"Retinal degenerative diseases (RDDs) affecting photoreceptors (PRs) are one of the most prevalent sources of incurable blindness worldwide. Due to a lack of endogenous repair mechanisms, functional cell replacement of PRs and/or retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) cells are among the most anticipated approaches for restoring vision in advanced RDD. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technologies have accelerated development of outer retinal cell therapies as they provide a theoretically unlimited source of donor cells. Human PSC-RPE replacement therapies have progressed rapidly, with several completed and ongoing clinical trials. Although potentially more promising, hPSC-PR replacement therapies are still in their infancy. A first-in-human trial of hPSC-derived neuroretinal transplantation has recently begun, but a number of questions regarding survival, reproducibility, functional integration, and mechanism of action remain. The discovery of biomaterial transfer between donor and PR cells has highlighted the need for rigorous safety and efficacy studies of PR replacement. In this review, we briefly discuss the history of neuroretinal and PR cell transplantation to identify remaining challenges and outline a stepwise approach to address specific pieces of the outer retinal cell replacement puzzle.

"In recent decades, a considerable increase in the number of tick-bitten humans has been recorded in the north of European Russia. At the same time, significant climatic changes, such as an increase in air temperature, were noticed in this region. The northern border of the ixodidae distribution area lies in the north of European Russia, therefore the analysis of the population dynamics is of particular interest regarding the possible impact of the climate changes. Unfortunately, in such a large territory field, studies on tick abundance are very difficult. In our study, the official statistics for the number of tick-bitten humans were used. This kind of statistical analysis has been conducted in the Russian Federation for many years, and can be used for the estimation of climate change impact on tick abundance. Statistical data on tick-bitten humans have been collected in three large regions for several decades. For the same regions, the average annual air temperature was calculated and modeled. An S-shaped distribution of the number of victims depending on the average annual air temperature was established, which can be described as ""Verhulst's law"", or logistic function. However, the development of the population does not depend on time, but on the temperature of the ambient air.

"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus suis meningoencephalitis is a zoonotic disease that mostly infects slaughterhouse workers. Rapid diagnosis of Streptococcus suis meningoencephalitis is critical for effective clinical management of this condition. However, the current diagnostic techniques are not effective for early diagnosis of this condition. To the best of our knowledge, the use of cerebrospinal fluid metagenomic next generation sequencing in the diagnosis of Streptococcus suis meningoencephalitis has been rarely reported. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we report a case of Streptococcus suis meningoencephalitis in a 51-year-old female patient. The patient had a history of long-term contact with pork and had a three-centimeter-long wound on her left leg prior to disease onset. Conventional tests, including blood culture, gram staining and cerebrospinal fluid culture, did not reveal bacterial infection. However, Streptococcus suis was detected in cerebrospinal fluid using metagenomic next generation sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic next generation sequencing is a promising approach for early diagnosis of central nervous system infections. This case report indicates that cases of clinical meningeal encephalitis of unknown cause can be diagnosed through this method.

"Invasive species, range-expanding species, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), synthetic organisms, and emerging pathogens increasingly affect the human environment. We propose a framework that allows comparison of consecutive stages that such novel organisms go through. The framework provides a common terminology for novel organisms, facilitating knowledge exchange among researchers, managers, and policy makers that work on, or have to make effective decisions about, novel organisms. The framework also indicates that knowledge about the causes and consequences of stage transitions for the better studied novel organisms, such as invasive species, can be transferred to more poorly studied ones, such as GMOs and emerging pathogens. Finally, the framework advances understanding of how climate change can affect the establishment, spread, and impacts of novel organisms, and how biodiversity affects, and is affected by, novel organisms.

"Bartonella spp. are facultative intracellular pathogens that employ a unique stealth infection strategy comprising immune evasion and modulation, intimate interaction with nucleated cells, and intraerythrocytic persistence. Infections with Bartonella are ubiquitous among mammals, and many species can infect humans either as their natural host or incidentally as zoonotic pathogens. Upon inoculation into a naive host, the bartonellae first colonize a primary niche that is widely accepted to involve the manipulation of nucleated host cells, e.g., in the microvasculature. Consistently, in vitro research showed that Bartonella harbors an ample arsenal of virulence factors to modulate the response of such cells, gain entrance, and establish an intracellular niche. Subsequently, the bacteria are seeded into the bloodstream where they invade erythrocytes and give rise to a typically asymptomatic intraerythrocytic bacteremia. While this course of infection is characteristic for natural hosts, zoonotic infections or the infection of immunocompromised patients may alter the path of Bartonella and result in considerable morbidity. In this review we compile current knowledge on the molecular processes underlying both the infection strategy and pathogenesis of Bartonella and discuss their connection to the clinical presentation of human patients, which ranges from minor complaints to life-threatening disease.

"Relapsing fever still remains a neglected disease and little is known on its reservoir, tick vector and physiopathology in the vertebrate host. The disease occurs in temperate as well as tropical countries. Relapsing fever borreliae are spirochaetes, members of the Borreliaceae family which also contain Lyme disease spirochaetes. They are mainly transmitted by Ornithodoros soft ticks, but some species are vectored by ixodid ticks. Traditionally a Borrelia species is associated with a specific vector in a particular geographical area. However, new species are regularly described, and taxonomical uncertainties deserve further investigations to better understand Borrelia vector/host adaptation. The medical importance of Borrelia miyamotoi, transmitted by Ixodes spp., has recently spawned new interest in this bacterial group. In this review, recent data on tick-host-pathogen interactions for tick-borne relapsing fevers is presented, with special focus on B. miyamotoi.

"A hallmark of Lotka-Volterra models, and other ecological models of predator-prey interactions, is that in predator-prey cycles, peaks in prey abundance precede peaks in predator abundance. Such models typically assume that species life history traits are fixed over ecologically relevant time scales. However, the coevolution of predator and prey traits has been shown to alter the community dynamics of natural systems, leading to novel dynamics including antiphase and cryptic cycles. Here, using an eco-coevolutionary model, we show that predator-prey coevolution can also drive population cycles where the opposite of canonical Lotka-Volterra oscillations occurs: predator peaks precede prey peaks. These reversed cycles arise when selection favors extreme phenotypes, predator offense is costly, and prey defense is effective against low-offense predators. We present multiple datasets from phage-cholera, mink-muskrat, and gyrfalcon-rock ptarmigan systems that exhibit reversed-peak ordering. Our results suggest that such cycles are a potential signature of predator-prey coevolution and reveal unique ways in which predator-prey coevolution can shape, and possibly reverse, community dynamics.

"Spillover of honey bee viruses have posed a significant threat to pollination services, triggering substantial effort in determining the host range of the viruses as an attempt to understand the transmission dynamics. Previous studies have reported infection of honey bee viruses in ants, raising the concern of ants serving as a reservoir host. Most of these studies, however, are restricted to a single, local ant population. We assessed the status (geographical distribution/prevalence/viral replication) and phylogenetic relationships of honey bee viruses in ants across the Asia-Pacific region, using deformed wing virus (DWV) and two widespread invasive ants, Paratrechina longicornis and Anoplolepis gracilipes, as the study system. DWV was detected in both ant species, with differential geographical distribution patterns and prevenance levels between them. These metrics, however, are consistent across the geographical range of the same ant species. Active replication was only evident in P. longicornis. We also showed that ant-associated DWV is genetically similar to that isolated from Asian populations of honey bees, suggesting that local acquisition of DWV by the invasive ants may have been common at least in some of our sampled regions. Transmission efficiency of DWV to local arthropods mediated by ant, however, may vary across ant species.

"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spillover infection in December 2019 has caused an unprecedented pandemic. SARS-CoV-2, as other coronaviruses, binds its target cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Accordingly, this makes ACE2 research essential for understanding the zoonotic nature of coronaviruses and identifying novel drugs. Here we present a systematic analysis of the ACE2 conservation and co-evolution protein network across 1,671 eukaryotes, revealing an unexpected conservation pattern in specific metazoans, plants, fungi, and protists. We identified the co-evolved protein network and pinpointed a list of drugs that target this network by using data integration from different sources. Our computational analysis found widely used drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and vasodilators. These drugs are expected to perturb the ACE2 network affecting infectivity as well as the pathophysiology of the disease.

"Quality management and independent assessment of high-throughput sequencing-based virus diagnostics have not yet been established as a mandatory approach for ensuring comparable results. The sensitivity and specificity of viral high-throughput sequence data analysis are highly affected by bioinformatics processing using publicly available and custom tools and databases and thus differ widely between individuals and institutions. Here we present the results of the COMPARE [Collaborative Management Platform for Detection and Analyses of (Re-)emerging and Foodborne Outbreaks in Europe] in silico virus proficiency test. An artificial, simulated in silico data set of Illumina HiSeq sequences was provided to 13 different European institutes for bioinformatics analysis to identify viral pathogens in high-throughput sequence data. Comparison of the participants' analyses shows that the use of different tools, programs, and databases for bioinformatics analyses can impact the correct identification of viral sequences from a simple data set. The identification of slightly mutated and highly divergent virus genomes has been shown to be most challenging. Furthermore, the interpretation of the results, together with a fictitious case report, by the participants showed that in addition to the bioinformatics analysis, the virological evaluation of the results can be important in clinical settings. External quality assessment and proficiency testing should become an important part of validating high-throughput sequencing-based virus diagnostics and could improve the harmonization, comparability, and reproducibility of results. There is a need for the establishment of international proficiency testing, like that established for conventional laboratory tests such as PCR, for bioinformatics pipelines and the interpretation of such results.

"It is hard to overemphasize the role that metagenomics has had on our recent understanding of RNA virus diversity. Metagenomics in the 21st century has brought with it an explosion in the number of RNA virus species, genera, and families far exceeding that following the discovery of the microscope in the 18th century for eukaryotic life or culture media in the 19th century for bacteriology or the 20th century for virology. When the definition of success in organism discovery is measured by sequence diversity and evolutionary distance, RNA viruses win. This review explores the history of RNA virus metagenomics, reasons for the successes so far in RNA virus metagenomics, and methodological concerns. In addition, the review briefly covers clinical metagenomics and environmental metagenomics and highlights some of the critical accomplishments that have defined the fast pace of RNA virus discoveries in recent years. Slightly more than a decade in, the field is exhausted from its discoveries but knows that there is yet even more out there to be found.

"Because phenotypic innovations must be genetically heritable for biological evolution to proceed, it is natural to consider new mutation events as well as standing genetic variation as sources for their birth. Previous research has identified a number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms that underlie a subset of adaptive traits in organisms. However, another well-known class of variation, genomic structural variation, could have even greater potential to produce adaptive phenotypes, due to the variety of possible types of alterations (deletions, insertions, duplications, among others) at different genomic positions and with variable lengths. It is from these dramatic genomic alterations, and selection on their phenotypic consequences, that adaptations leading to biological diversification could be derived. In this review, using studies in humans and other mammals, we highlight examples of how phenotypic variation from structural variants might become adaptive in populations and potentially enable biological diversification. Phenotypic change arising from structural variants will be described according to their immediate effect on organismal metabolic processes, immunological response and physical features. Study of population dynamics of segregating structural variation can therefore provide a window into understanding current and historical biological diversification.

"It is important to track fecal sources from humans and animals that negatively influence the water quality of rural rivers and human health. In this study, microbial source tracking (MST) methods using molecular markers and the community-based FEAST (fast expectation-maximization microbial source tracking) program were synergistically applied to distinguish the fecal contributions of multiple sources in a rural river located in Beijing, China. The performance of eight markers were evaluated using 133 fecal samples based on real-time quantitative (qPCR) technique. Among them, six markers, including universal (BacUni), human-associated (HF183-1 and BacH), swine-associated (Pig-2-Bac), ruminant-associated (Rum-2-Bac), and avian-associated (AV4143) markers, performed well in the study. A total of 96 water samples from the river and outfalls showed a coordinated composition of fecal pollution, which revealed that outfall water might be a potential input of the Fsq River. In the FEAST program, bacterial 16S rRNA genes of 58 fecal and 12 water samples were sequenced to build the ""source"" library and ""sink,"" respectively. The relative contribution (<4.01% of sequence reads) of each source (i.e., human, swine, bovine, or sheep) was calculated based on simultaneous screening of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of sources and sinks, which indicated that community-based MST methods could be promising tools for identifying fecal sources from a more comprehensive perspective. Results of the qPCR assays indicated that fecal contamination from human was dominant during dry weather and that fecal sources from swine and ruminant were more prevalent in samples during the wet season than in those during the dry season, which were consistent with the findings predicted by the FEAST program using a very small sample size. Information from the study could be valuable for the development of improved regulation policies to reduce the levels of fecal contamination in rural rivers.

"Introduction: Tularemia is a zoonotic infection caused by the highly infectious bacterium Francisella tularensis. Persons having outdoor professions are more likely than others to be exposed to F. tularensis through increased contact with arthropods, infected animals, and contaminated aerosols. Materials and Methods: After a tularemia epizootic during July and August 2015 at Devils Tower National Monument and an associated tularemia infection in a park employee, we assessed seroprevalence of F. tularensis antibodies, risk factors for F. tularensis seropositivity, and use of protective measures among park employees. Results: Seroprevalence among participating employees was 13% (3/23). Seropositive employees reported multiple risk factors for F. tularensis exposure through both job-related and recreational activities. Activities reported by more seropositive than seronegative employees included using a power blower (67% vs. 5%, p = 0.03), collecting animal carcasses (100% vs. 30%, p = 0.047), and hunting prairie dogs recreationally (67% vs. 5%, p = 0.03). Seropositive employees reported exposure to more ticks (median 30, range 25-35) than seronegative employees (median 6, range 0-25, p = 0.001). Most employees used protective measures (e.g., insect repellent) inconsistently but increased use after receiving educational materials. Conclusions: Educating and enabling at-risk employees to use protective measures consistently, both at work and during recreational activities, can reduce exposure during epizootics.

"Given the significant impact of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) on both human and animal health, predicting their dynamics and understanding their transmission cycle is of the utmost importance. Usually, predictions about the distribution of priority pathogens, such as Dengue, Yellow fever, West Nile Virus and St. Louis encephalitis, relate abiotic elements to simple biotic components, such as a single causal agent. Furthermore, focusing on single pathogens neglects the possibility of interactions and the existence of common elements in the transmission cycles of multiple pathogens. A necessary, but not sufficient, condition that a mosquito be a vector of a MBFV is that it co-occurs with hosts of the pathogen. We therefore use a recently developed modeling framework, based on co-occurrence data, to infer potential biotic interactions between those mosquito and mammal species which have previously been identified as vectors or confirmed positives of at least one of the considered MBFVs. We thus create models for predicting the relative importance of mosquito species as potential vectors for each pathogen, and also for all pathogens together, using the known vectors to validate the models. We infer that various mosquito species are likely to be significant vectors, even though they have not currently been identified as such, and are likely to harbor multiple pathogens, again validating the predictions with known results. Besides the above ""niche-based"" viewpoint we also consider an assemblage-based analysis, wherein we use a community-identification algorithm to identify those mosquito and/or mammal species that form assemblages by dint of their significant degree of co-occurrence. The most cohesive assemblage includes important primary vectors, such as A. aegypti, A. albopictus, C. quinquefasciatus, C. pipiens and mammals with abundant populations that are well-adapted to human environments, such as the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), peccary (Tayassu pecari), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and bats (Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium). Our results suggest that this assemblage has an important role in the transmission dynamics of this viral group viewed as a complex multi-pathogen-vector-host system. By including biotic risk factors our approach also modifies the geographical risk profiles of the spatial distribution of MBFVs in Mexico relative to a consideration of only abiotic niche variables.

"A 50-year-old woman from Pulaski, Virginia, presented to a local clinic with headaches, fever, generalized joint pain, excessive thirst and fluid intake, and a progressing rash on her back. On physical examination, she had a large circular red rash on her back with a bull's-eye appearance, 16 × 18 cm in diameter. Serologic tests confirmed a diagnosis of Lyme disease. The patient could recall a walk through the woods 3 weeks prior, although she never noticed a tick on her body. Following a prolonged course of antibiotics, this case report presents a patient with ongoing symptoms consistent with post-treatment Lyme disease.

"The build-up of species locally within a region by allopatric speciation depends on geographically separated (allopatric) sister populations becoming reproductively incompatible followed by secondary sympatry. Among birds, this has happened frequently in remote archipelagos, spectacular cases including the Darwin's finches (Geospizinae) and Hawaiian honeycreepers (Drepanidinae), but similar examples are lacking in archipelagos nearer to continental landmasses. Of the required steps in the speciation cycle, achievement of secondary sympatry appears to be limiting in near archipelagos and, by extension, in continental regions. Here, I suggest that secondary sympatry might be prevented by apparent competition mediated through pathogens that are locally coevolved with one population of host and are pathogenic in sister populations. The absence of numerous pathogens in remote archipelagos might, therefore, allow sister populations to achieve secondary sympatry more readily and thereby accelerate diversification. By similar reasoning, species should accumulate relatively slowly within continental regions. In this essay, I explore the assumptions and some implications of this model for species diversification.

"The sustained-release formulation of meloxicam (MSR) is a compounded NSAID that may provide pain relief for as long as 72 h after administration. MSR injection-site skin reactions have occurred in several species but have not previously been observed in mice. We investigated the development and progression of localized skin reactions after a single injection of MSR in Crl:CD1(ICR), C57BL/6J, and BALB/cJ mice. Each mouse received a subcutaneous injection of MSR (n = 60), standard-formulation meloxicam (MEL; n = 24) or saline (control; SC; n = 24) and was scored daily according to a 5-point system for erythema and mass characteristics. Mice were euthanized at either 7 or 14 d after injection and underwent postmortem analysis. MSR-treated mice had more erythematous and mass reactions than did MEL and SC mice. Mass lesions developed in 49 MSR mice (82%; 95% CI, 70% to 90%), 5 MEL animals (21%; 95% CI, 7% to 42%), and 1 SC mouse. MSR-treated BALB/cJ developed erythematous lesions less frequently than similarly treated Crl:CD1(ICR) or C57BL/6J. Lesions often were ventrolateral to the injection site. The median times to the appearance of mass and erythematous lesions were 2 d and 3 d, respectively. Histologically, the erythematous and mass reactions correlated with necrotizing to pyogranulomatous injection-site panniculitis. Inflammation severity scores at 7 and 14 d after injection were greater in the MSR-treated group than the other 2 groups. No strain- or sex-associated differences emerged except that inflammation severity scores at day 14 were higher in Crl:CD1(ICR) females than males. The character of the inflammatory response in MSR-treated mice did not differ between 7 and 14 d after injection, indicating that MSR-induced inflammation is slow to resolve. The ventral migration and delayed onset of MSR injection-site reactions could result in their being attributed to another cause or not being identified. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of the potential for slowly resolving injection-site reactions with MSR.

"For many pathogens with environmental stages, or those carried by vectors or intermediate hosts, disease transmission is strongly influenced by pathogen, host, and vector movements across complex landscapes, and thus quantitative measures of movement rate and direction can reveal new opportunities for disease management and intervention. Genetic assignment methods are a set of powerful statistical approaches useful for establishing population membership of individuals. Recent theoretical improvements allow these techniques to be used to cost-effectively estimate the magnitude and direction of key movements in infectious disease systems, revealing important ecological and environmental features that facilitate or limit transmission. Here, we review the theory, statistical framework, and molecular markers that underlie assignment methods, and we critically examine recent applications of assignment tests in infectious disease epidemiology. Research directions that capitalize on use of the techniques are discussed, focusing on key parameters needing study for improved understanding of patterns of disease.

"The largest targets of retinal input in mammals are the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), a relay to the primary visual cortex (V1), and the superior colliculus. V1 innervates and influences the superior colliculus. Here, we find that, in turn, superior colliculus modulates responses in mouse V1. Optogenetically inhibiting the superior colliculus reduces responses in V1 to optimally sized stimuli. Superior colliculus could influence V1 via its strong projection to the lateral posterior nucleus (LP/Pulvinar) or its weaker projection to the dLGN. Inhibiting superior colliculus strongly reduces activity in LP. Pharmacologically silencing LP itself, however, does not remove collicular modulation of V1. The modulation is instead due to a collicular gain modulation of the dLGN. Surround suppression operating in V1 explains the different effects for differently sized stimuli. Computations of visual saliency in the superior colliculus can thus influence tuning in the visual cortex via a tectogeniculate pathway.

"We report a successful surgical sterilization procedure for population control of 324 male and female free-ranging grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in Genoa (Italy). We describe the clinical procedure from the trapping of the animals to their surgical sterilization and release in another part of the city. Live-trapped squirrels were transported to the veterinary clinic within 1-2 hr of capture and maintained in a hospitalization room reserved for them. The waiting period before surgery was kept below 12 hr. The developed procedure has resulted in a survival of 94% of trapped squirrels from surgery to animal release. Sterilized squirrels started to feed in a very short time (1.0-1.5 hr), and after 2-3 days, it was possible to release them in a new area. Amoxicillin was used as a long-acting postoperative antibiotic to reduce the period of captivity. The successful surgical procedure described here can provide an important additional tool for the management of introduced populations of squirrels. We showed that the surgical sterilization of some hundred squirrels is clinically possible and could be included in management strategies aimed at removing critical populations of these species. Moreover, the data allow dosages and operational times in order to provide economic viability assessment of future population control measures.

"Understanding the interactions between host and pathogen is important for the development and assessment of medical countermeasures to infectious agents, including potential biodefence pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis, Ebola virus, and Francisella tularensis. This review focuses on technological advances which allow this interaction to be studied in much greater detail. Namely, the use of ""omic"" technologies (next generation sequencing, DNA, and protein microarrays) for dissecting the underlying host response to infection at the molecular level; optical imaging techniques (flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy) for assessing cellular responses to infection; and biophotonic imaging for visualising the infectious disease process. All of these technologies hold great promise for important breakthroughs in the rational development of vaccines and therapeutics for biodefence agents.

"The use of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab sampling for the detection of various respiratory pathogens has been a standard procedure in medicine for many years. While this is a fairly common procedure, there has been a significant increase in utilization recently due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We describe a case of a 40-year-old SARS-CoV-2 positive patient with no prior cardiac history who developed asystole while an NP swab was being used to obtain a sample for a SARS-CoV-2 assay. Return of normal sinus rhythm was achieved with chest compressions alone. The incident was deemed to have been an exaggerated vagal response to intranasal stimulation; better known as the trigeminocardiac reflex. This is the first reported case describing asystole during use of an NP swab. This case occurred in a patient with no known cardiac disease and highlights the potential importance of the arrhythmogenic nature of COVID-19 that could potentiate the vagal response in susceptible individuals undergoing NP sampling.

"Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are recognized as having significant social, economic and ecological costs, threatening human health, food security, wildlife conservation and biodiversity. We review the processes underlying the emergence of infectious disease, focusing on the similarities and differences between conceptual models of disease emergence and biological invasions in general.Study of the IUCN's list of the world's worst invaders reveals that disease is cited as a driver behind the conservation, medical or economic impact of nearly a quarter of the species on the data base.The emergence of novel diseases in new host species are, in essence, examples of invasions by parasites. Many of the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of disease emergence and classical invasions are also shared, with environmental change and global transport providing opportunities for the introduction and spread of invaders and novel parasites.The phases of disease emergence and biological invasions have many parallels; particularly the early and late phases, where demographic and anthropogenic factors are key drivers. However, there are also differences in the intermediate phases, where host-parasite co-evolution plays a crucial role in determining parasite establishment in novel hosts.Similar opportunities and constraints on control and management occur at the different phases of invasions and disease emergence. However, exploitation of host immune responses offers additional control opportunities through contact control and vaccination against EIDs. We propose that cross-fertilization between the disciplines of disease emergence and invasion biology may provide further insights into their prediction, control and management.

"SARS-CoV-2 is the etiological agent responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to spread with devastating effects on global health and socioeconomics. The susceptibility of domestic and wild animal species to infection is a critical facet of SARS-CoV-2 ecology, since reverse zoonotic spillover events resulting in SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in animal populations could result in the establishment of new virus reservoirs. Adaptive mutations in the virus to new animal species could also complicate ongoing mitigation strategies to combat SARS-CoV-2. In addition, animal species susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection are essential as standardized preclinical models for the development and efficacy testing of vaccines and therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the current findings regarding the susceptibility of different domestic and wild animal species to experimental SARS-CoV-2 infection and provide detailed descriptions of the clinical disease and transmissibility in these animals. In addition, we outline the documented natural infections in animals that have occurred at the human-animal interface. A comprehensive understanding of animal susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 is crucial to inform public health, veterinary, and agricultural systems, and to guide environmental policies.

"Parasites have historically been considered a scourge, deserving of annihilation. Although parasite eradications rank among humanity's greatest achievements, new research is shedding light on the collateral effects of parasite loss. Here, we explore a ""world without parasites"": a thought experiment for illuminating the ecological roles that parasites play in ecosystems. While there is robust evidence for the effects of parasites on host individuals (eg affecting host vital rates), this exercise highlights how little we know about the influence of parasites on communities and ecosystems (eg altering energy flow through food webs). We present hypotheses for novel, interesting, and general effects of parasites. These hypotheses are largely untested, and should be considered a springboard for future research. While many uncertainties exist, the available evidence suggests that a world without parasites would be very different from the world we know, with effects extending from host individuals to populations, communities, and even ecosystems.

"The ability of animals to respond to life-threatening stimuli is essential for survival. Although vision provides one of the major sensory inputs for detecting threats across animal species, the circuitry underlying defensive responses to visual stimuli remains poorly defined. Here, we investigate the circuitry underlying innate defensive behaviours elicited by predator-like visual stimuli in mice. Our results demonstrate that neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) are essential for a variety of acute and persistent defensive responses to overhead looming stimuli. Optogenetic mapping revealed that SC projections to the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) of the thalamus, a non-canonical polymodal sensory relay, are sufficient to mimic visually evoked fear responses. In vivo electrophysiology experiments identified a di-synaptic circuit from SC through LP to the lateral amygdale (Amg), and lesions of the Amg blocked the full range of visually evoked defensive responses. Our results reveal a novel collicular-thalamic-Amg circuit important for innate defensive responses to visual threats.

"Borrelia burgdorferi, an emerging bacterial pathogen, is maintained in nature by transmission from one vertebrate host to another by ticks. One of the few antigens against which mammals develop protective immunity is the highly polymorphic OspC protein, encoded by the ospC gene on the cp26 plasmid. Intragenic recombination among ospC genes is known, but the extent to which recombination extended beyond the ospC locus itself is undefined. We accessed and supplemented collections of DNA sequences of ospC and other loci from ticks in three U.S. regions (the Northeast, the Midwest, and northern California); a total of 839 ospC sequences were analyzed. Three overlapping but distinct populations of B. burgdorferi corresponded to the geographic regions. In addition, we sequenced 99 ospC flanking sequences from different lineages and compared the complete cp26 sequences of 11 strains as well as the cp26 bbb02 loci of 56 samples. Besides recombinations with traces limited to the ospC gene itself, there was evidence of lateral gene transfers that involved (i) part of the ospC gene and one of the two flanks or (ii) the entire ospC gene and different lengths of both flanks. Lateral gene transfers resulted in different linkages between the ospC gene and loci of the chromosome or other plasmids. By acquisition of the complete part or a large part of a novel ospC gene, an otherwise adapted strain would assume a new serotypic identity, thereby being comparatively fitter in an area with a high prevalence of immunity to existing OspC types.

"Comparative studies have greatly contributed to our understanding of the organization and function of visual pathways of the brain, including that of humans. This comparative approach is a particularly useful tactic for studying the pulvinar nucleus, an enigmatic structure which comprises the largest territory of the human thalamus. This review focuses on the regions of the mouse pulvinar that receive input from the superior colliculus, and highlights similarities of the tectorecipient pulvinar identified across species. Open questions are discussed, as well as the potential contributions of the mouse model for endeavors to elucidate the function of the pulvinar nucleus.

"BACKGROUND: Invasive predators may change the structure of invaded communities through predation and competition with native species. In Europe, the invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is excluding the native white clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study compared the predatory functional responses and prey choice of native and invasive crayfish and measured impacts of parasitism on the predatory strength of the native species. Invasive crayfish showed a higher (>10%) prey (Gammarus pulex) intake rate than (size matched) natives, reflecting a shorter (16%) prey handling time. The native crayfish also showed greater selection for crustacean prey over molluscs and bloodworm, whereas the invasive species was a more generalist predator. A. pallipes parasitised by the microsporidian parasite Thelohania contejeani showed a 30% reduction in prey intake. We suggest that this results from parasite-induced muscle damage, and this is supported by a reduced (38%) attack rate and increased (30%) prey handling time. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that the per capita (i.e., functional response) difference between the species may contribute to success of the invader and extinction of the native species, as well as decreased biodiversity and biomass in invaded rivers. In addition, the reduced predatory strength of parasitized natives may impair their competitive abilities, facilitating exclusion by the invader.

"After Edward Jenner established human vaccination over 200 years ago, attenuated poxviruses became key players to contain the deadliest virus of its own family: Variola virus (VARV), the causative agent of smallpox. Cowpox virus (CPXV) and horsepox virus (HSPV) were extensively used to this end, passaged in cattle and humans until the appearance of vaccinia virus (VACV), which was used in the final campaigns aimed to eradicate the disease, an endeavor that was accomplished by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1980. Ever since, naturally evolved strains used for vaccination were introduced into research laboratories where VACV and other poxviruses with improved safety profiles were generated. Recombinant DNA technology along with the DNA genome features of this virus family allowed the generation of vaccines against heterologous diseases, and the specific insertion and deletion of poxvirus genes generated an even broader spectrum of modified viruses with new properties that increase their immunogenicity and safety profile as vaccine vectors. In this review, we highlight the evolution of poxvirus vaccines, from first generation to the current status, pointing out how different vaccines have emerged and approaches that are being followed up in the development of more rational vaccines against a wide range of diseases.

"Here we describe 5 cases of molar malocclusions in adult pine voles (Microtus pinetorum) used for behavioral endocrinology studies. This species belongs to the subfamily Microtinae, which possess aradicular hypsodont molars. The abnormal molars identified caused apparent difficulty in mastication, resulting in poor body condition necessitating euthanasia. Postmortem examination of the oral cavity revealed grossly elongated mandibular and maxillary molars with abnormal wear at occlusal surfaces. This colony health problem was addressed successfully by adding autoclaved hardwood sticks to each cage as an enrichment tool.

"Identification of landscape features that correlate with genetic structure permits understanding of factors that may influence gene flow in a species. Comparing effects of the landscape on a parasite and host provides potential insights into parasite-host ecology. We compared fine-scale spatial genetic structure between big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and their cimicid ectoparasite (Cimex adjunctus; class Insecta) in the lower Great Lakes region of the United States, in an area of about 160,000 km(2). We genotyped 142 big brown bat and 55 C. adjunctus samples at eight and seven microsatellite loci, respectively, and inferred effects of various types of land cover on the genetic structure of each species. We found significant associations between several land cover types and genetic distance in both species, although different land cover types were influential in each. Our results suggest that even in a parasite that is almost entirely reliant on its hosts for dispersal, land cover can affect gene flow differently than in the hosts, depending on key ecological aspects of both species.

"Human-wildlife interactions, including human-wildlife conflict, are increasingly common as expanding urbanization worldwide creates more opportunities for people to encounter wildlife. Wildlife-vehicle collisions, zoonotic disease transmission, property damage, and physical attacks to people or their pets have negative consequences for both people and wildlife, underscoring the need for comprehensive strategies that mitigate and prevent conflict altogether. Management techniques often aim to deter, relocate, or remove individual organisms, all of which may present a significant selective force in both urban and nonurban systems. Management-induced selection may significantly affect the adaptive or nonadaptive evolutionary processes of urban populations, yet few studies explicate the links among conflict, wildlife management, and urban evolution. Moreover, the intensity of conflict management can vary considerably by taxon, public perception, policy, religious and cultural beliefs, and geographic region, which underscores the complexity of developing flexible tools to reduce conflict. Here, we present a cross-disciplinary perspective that integrates human-wildlife conflict, wildlife management, and urban evolution to address how social-ecological processes drive wildlife adaptation in cities. We emphasize that variance in implemented management actions shapes the strength and rate of phenotypic and evolutionary change. We also consider how specific management strategies either promote genetic or plastic changes, and how leveraging those biological inferences could help optimize management actions while minimizing conflict. Investigating human-wildlife conflict as an evolutionary phenomenon may provide insights into how conflict arises and how management plays a critical role in shaping urban wildlife phenotypes.

"Hepatozoon apri n. sp. is described from Japanese wild boars Sus scrofa leucomystax in Japan. The gamonts in the peripheral blood leukocytes were 11.6 ± 1.4 × 6.7 ± 1.3 μm in size. The meronts in the muscle tissues were 35.0-47.5 μm in length and 26.5-30 μm in width. A high rate (53.0%) of infection was found by nested PCR using muscle specimens from 181 wild boars captured in Tokushima, Japan. A phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA gene sequences revealed that H. apri n. sp. detected in wild boars is closely related to Hepatozoon spp. isolated from carnivores. This is the first description of a species belonging to the genus Hepatozoon detected in ungulates.

"Who worries first about an invasive alien species: scientists or the general public, or do both become concerned simultaneously? Taking thirteen invasive alien species in the Netherlands, this article reconstructs the development of their public and scientific salience: the attention they attracted and the knowledge about them. Salience was assessed from the number of publications from 1997 onwards in the LexisNexis newspaper database and Scopus scientific database. Three trajectories were derived for a species to move from being a latent problem with low salience toward a manifest status with high public and scientific salience. In the most common trajectory, scientific salience increased first, followed by an increase in public salience. We probed the merit of this concept of trajectories by examining the action undertaken for a representative species of the trajectories. We assigned each of these three species a code for inertia and inaction based on the content of a hundred newspaper articles and all available government documents. Knowing the scientific and public salience of these species clarifies why the actions to deal with them differed even though from an ecological perspective they warranted similar attention. The typology of public and scientific salience and the problem trajectories developed in this article together offer a structured approach for understanding an invasive alien species and provide pointers for engaging a community in managing that species.

"Cation channel of sperm 1 (CATSPER1) is a unique sperm cation channel protein, and essential for sperm function and male fertility. CATSPER1 exclusively expresses in meiotic and postmeiotic spermatogenic cells, thus belongs to the spermatogenesis-specific antigen that escape central tolerance. We have previously demonstrated the immunocontraceptive potential of its transmembrane domains and pore region, and reported the antifertility effects of its B-cell epitopes on male mice. Aiming to develop DNA vaccine targeting CATSPER1 for male contraception, here the whole open reading frame of mouse Catsper1 was cloned into the plasmid pEGFP-N1 to obtain a DNA vaccine pEGFP-N1-Catsper1. The vaccine was confirmed to be transcribed and translated in mouse N2a cell in vitro and mouse muscle tissue in vivo. Intramuscular injection with the vaccine on male mice induced specific immune reaction and caused significant inhibition on sperm hyperactivated motility and progressive motility (P<0.001 for both), and consequently reduced male fertility. The fertility rate of experimental group was 40.9%, which was significant lower (P=0.012) than control group (81.8%). No significant change in mating behavior, sperm production and histology of testis/epididymis was observed. Given that Catsper1 exhibits a high degree of homology among different species, Catsper1 DNA vaccine might be a good strategy for developing an immunocontraceptive vaccine for human and animal use.

"Fecal pollution indicators are essential to identify and remediate contamination sources and protect public health. Historically, easily cultured facultative anaerobes such as fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, or enterococci have been used but these indicators generally provide no information as to their source. More recently, molecular methods have targeted fecal anaerobes, which are much more abundant in humans and other mammals, and some strains appear to be associated with particular host sources. Next-generation sequencing and microbiome studies have created an unprecedented inventory of microbial communities associated with fecal sources, allowing reexamination of which taxonomic groups are best suited as informative indicators. The use of new computational methods, such as oligotyping coupled with well-established machine learning approaches, is providing new insights into patterns of host association. In this review we examine the basis for host-specificity and the rationale for using 16S rRNA gene targets for alternative indicators and highlight two taxonomic groups, Bacteroidales and Lachnospiraceae, which are rich in host-specific bacterial organisms. Finally, we discuss considerations for using alternative indicators for water quality assessments with a particular focus on detecting human sewage sources of contamination.

"Precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression in the developing brain is critical for neural circuit formation, and comprehensive expression mapping in the developing primate brain is crucial to understand brain function in health and disease. Here, we developed an unbiased, automated, large-scale, cellular-resolution in situ hybridization (ISH)-based gene expression profiling system (GePS) and companion analysis to reveal gene expression patterns in the neonatal New World marmoset cortex, thalamus, and striatum that are distinct from those in mice. Gene-ontology analysis of marmoset-specific genes revealed associations with catalytic activity in the visual cortex and neuropsychiatric disorders in the thalamus. Cortically expressed genes with clear area boundaries were used in a three-dimensional cortical surface mapping algorithm to delineate higher-order cortical areas not evident in two-dimensional ISH data. GePS provides a powerful platform to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying primate neurobiology and developmental psychiatric and neurological disorders.

"Metal hyperaccumulating plants are able to accumulate exceptionally high concentrations of metals, such as zinc, nickel, or cadmium, in their aerial tissues. These metals reach concentrations that would be toxic to most other plant species. This trait has evolved multiple times independently in the plant kingdom. Recent studies have provided new insight into the ecological and evolutionary significance of this trait, by showing that some metal hyperaccumulating plants can use high concentrations of accumulated metals to defend themselves against attack by pathogenic microorganisms and herbivores. Here, we review the evidence that metal hyperaccumulation acts as a defensive trait in plants, with particular emphasis on plant-pathogen interactions. We discuss the mechanisms by which defense against pathogens might have driven the evolution of metal hyperaccumulation, including the interaction of this trait with other forms of defense. In particular, we consider how physiological adaptations and fitness costs associated with metal hyperaccumulation could have resulted in trade-offs between metal hyperaccumulation and other defenses. Drawing on current understanding of the population ecology of metal hyperaccumulator plants, we consider the conditions that might have been necessary for metal hyperaccumulation to be selected as a defensive trait, and discuss the likelihood that these were fulfilled. Based on these conditions, we propose a possible scenario for the evolution of metal hyperaccumulation, in which selective pressure for resistance to pathogens or herbivores, combined with gene flow from non-metallicolous populations, increases the likelihood that the metal hyperaccumulating trait becomes established in plant populations.

"The epidemiology of tularemia has influenced, perhaps incorrectly skewed, our views on the ecology of the agent of tularemia. In particular, the central role of lagomorphs needs to be reexamined. Diverse observations, some incidental, and some that are more generally reproducible, have not been synthesized so that the critical elements of the perpetuation of Francisella tularensis can be identified. Developing a quantitative model of the basic reproduction number of F. tularensis may require separate treatments for Type A and Type B given the fundamental differences in their ecology.

"The feral pig populations of many countries continue to increase. Scientific studies on population size are scarce, while the numbers of reported observations on presence of and damage caused by feral pigs are increasing. Feral pigs can carry and spread several diseases (including zoonotic), but African Swine Fever (ASF) is of most concern. It is a highly transmissible viral disease associated with an extremely high mortality rate. Since 2009 ASF has appeared in several European countries, with cases being identified first among local feral pigs and consequently in domestic pig production units, indicating a clear linkage with the movement of the feral pig population and the spread of the disease across national boundaries. Control of feral pig populations is currently under discussion. Because massive culling raises questions of animal welfare and ethics, fertility control could represent an important and effective means to control feral pig populations. Contraceptive vaccines have been used with some degree of success in many wild species because they are able to provide a long-term effect without any consequent health problems. However, extensive and efficacious use of vaccines to control feral pig populations is not simple. The aim of this article was to review the progress in immunocontraception use in feral pigs, providing an account of the current status and future perspectives.

"RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a promising technique for gene therapy. However, the safe and long-term expression of small RNA molecules is a major concern for the application of RNAi therapies in vivo. Borna disease virus (BDV), a non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus, establishes a persistent infection without obvious cytopathic effects. Unique among animal non-retroviral RNA viruses, BDV persistently establishes a long-lasting persistent infection in the nucleus. These features make BDV ideal for RNA virus vector persistently expressing small RNAs. Here, we demonstrated that the recombinant BDV (rBDV) containing the miR-155 precursor, rBDV-miR-155, persistently expressed miR-155 and efficiently silenced its target gene. The stem region of the miR-155 precursor in rBDV-miR-155 was replaceable by any miRNA sequences of interest and that such rBDVs efficiently silence the expression of target genes. Collectively, BDV vector would be a novel RNA virus vector enabling the long-term expression of miRNAs for RNAi therapies.

"In biomedical research recombinant poxviruses are investigated as important candidate medicines to derive advanced options for prevention and/or treatment of infectious diseases or cancer. Genetically engineered viruses can readily synthesize biologically active heterologous proteins, serve to determine relevant targets of cell-mediated and humoral immunity, and identify types of immune responses needed for protection against a multitude of different specific diseases. Substantial progress in vaccine development is based on the availability of exceptionally safe but efficient carrier viruses, on increasingly versatile vector technologies and on the feasibility of large scale manufacturing. Moreover, advances in deciphering the molecular pathways regulating poxvirus-host interactions will provide additional means to potently activate innate immune stimulation upon vaccination and to derive vectors with specifically targeted replicative capacity for experimental tumor therapy.

"Small and isolated populations often exhibit low genetic diversity due to drift and inbreeding, but may simultaneously harbour adaptive variation. We investigate spatial distributions of immunogenetic variation in American badger subspecies (Taxidea taxus), as a proxy for evaluating their evolutionary potential across the northern extent of the species' range. We compared genetic structure of 20 microsatellites and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC DRB exon 2) to evaluate whether small, isolated populations show low adaptive polymorphism relative to large and well-connected populations. Our results suggest that gene flow plays a prominent role in shaping MHC polymorphism across large spatial scales, while the interplay between gene flow and selection was stronger towards the northern peripheries. The similarity of MHC alleles within subspecies relative to their neutral genetic differentiation suggests that adaptive divergence among subspecies can be maintained despite ongoing gene flow along subspecies boundaries. Neutral genetic diversity was low in small relative to large populations, but MHC diversity within individuals was high in small populations. Despite reduced neutral genetic variation, small and isolated populations harbour functional variation that likely contribute to the species evolutionary potential at the northern range. Our findings suggest that conservation approaches should focus on managing adaptive variation across the species range rather than protecting subspecies per se.

"Existing sources of wildlife morbidity and mortality data were evaluated and 3 pilot active surveillance projects were undertaken to compare and contrast methods for collecting wildlife disease data on Vancouver Island for public health purposes. Few organizations could collect samples for diagnostic evaluation, fewer still maintained records, and none regularly characterized or reported wildlife disease for public health purposes. Wildlife rehabilitation centers encountered the greatest variety of wildlife from the largest geographic area and frequently received submissions from other organizations. Obstacles to participation included the following: permit restrictions; financial disincentives; staff safety; no mandate to collect relevant data; and lack of contact between wildlife and public health agencies. Despite these obstacles, modest investments in personnel allowed novel pathogens of public health concern to be tracked. Targeted surveillance for known pathogens in specific host species, rather than general surveys for unspecified pathogens, was judged to be a more effective and efficient way to provide useful public health data.

"BACKGROUND: Aedes albopictus is an invasive species which continues expanding its geographic range and involvement in mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya and dengue. Host selection patterns by invasive mosquitoes are critically important because they increase endemic disease transmission and drive outbreaks of exotic pathogens. Traditionally, Ae. albopictus has been characterized as an opportunistic feeder, primarily feeding on mammalian hosts but occasionally acquiring blood from avian sources as well. However, limited information is available on their feeding patterns in temperate regions of their expanded range. Because of the increasing expansion and abundance of Ae. albopictus and the escalating diagnoses of exotic pathogens in travelers returning from endemic areas, we investigated the host feeding patterns of this species in newly invaded areas to further shed light on its role in disease ecology and assess the public health threat of an exotic arbovirus outbreak. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified the vertebrate source of 165 blood meals in Ae. albopictus collected between 2008 and 2011 from urban and suburban areas in northeastern USA. We used a network of Biogents Sentinel traps, which enhance Ae. albopictus capture counts, to conduct our collections of blooded mosquitoes. We also analyzed blooded Culex mosquitoes collected alongside Ae. albopictus in order to examine the composition of the community of blood sources. We found no evidence of bias since as expected Culex blood meals were predominantly from birds (n = 149, 93.7%) with only a small proportion feeding on mammals (n = 10, 6.3%). In contrast, Aedes albopictus fed exclusively on mammalian hosts with over 90% of their blood meals derived from humans (n = 96, 58.2%) and domesticated pets (n = 38, 23.0% cats; and n = 24, 14.6% dogs). Aedes albopictus fed from humans significantly more often in suburban than in urban areas (χ(2), p = 0.004) and cat-derived blood meals were greater in urban habitats (χ(2), p = 0.022). Avian-derived blood meals were not detected in any of the Ae. albopictus tested. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The high mammalian affinity of Ae. albopictus suggests that this species will be an efficient vector of mammal- and human-driven zoonoses such as La Crosse, dengue, and chikungunya viruses. The lack of blood meals obtained from birds by Ae. albopictus suggest that this species may have limited exposure to endemic avian zoonoses such as St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus, which already circulate in the USA. However, growing populations of Ae. albopictus in major metropolitan urban and suburban centers, make a large autochthonous outbreak of an arbovirus such as chikungunya or dengue viruses a clear and present danger. Given the difficulties of Ae. albopictus suppression, we recommend that public health practitioners and policy makers install proactive measures for the imminent mitigation of an exotic pathogen outbreak.

"Over the last 60 years, Alaska's mean annual temperature has increased by 1.6°C, more than twice the rate of the rest of the United States. As a result, climate change impacts are more pronounced here than in other regions of the United States. Warmer temperatures may allow some infected host animals to survive winters in larger numbers, increase their population and expand their range of habitation thus increasing the opportunity for transmission of infection to humans. Subsistence hunting and gathering activities may place rural residents of Alaska at a greater risk of acquiring zoonotic infections than urban residents. Known zoonotic diseases that occur in Alaska include brucellosis, toxoplasmosis, trichinellosis, giardiasis/cryptosporidiosis, echinococcosis, rabies and tularemia. Actions for early disease detection, research and prevention and control include: (1) determining baseline levels of infection and disease in both humans and host animals; (2) conducting more research to understand the ecology of infection in the Arctic environment; (3) improving active and passive surveillance systems for infection and disease in humans and animals; (4) improving outreach, education and communication on climate-sensitive infectious diseases at the community, health and animal care provider levels; and (5) improving coordination between public health and animal health agencies, universities and tribal health organisations.

"The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is a model system for understanding thalamic organization and the classification of inputs as ""drivers"" or ""modulators."" Retinogeniculate terminals provide the primary excitatory drive for the relay of information to visual cortex (V1), while nonretinal inputs act in concert to modulate the gain of retinogeniculate signal transmission. How do inputs from the superior colliculus, a visuomotor structure, fit into this schema? Using a variety of anatomical, optogenetic, and in vitro physiological techniques in mice, we show that dLGN inputs from the superior colliculus (tectogeniculate) possess many of the ultrastructural and synaptic properties that define drivers. Tectogeniculate and retinogeniculate terminals converge to innervate one class of dLGN neurons within the dorsolateral shell, the primary terminal domain of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells. These dLGN neurons project to layer I of V1 to form synaptic contacts with dendrites of deeper-layer neurons. We suggest that tectogeniculate inputs act as ""backseat drivers,"" which may alert shell neurons to movement commands generated by the superior colliculus. Significance statement: The conventional view of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is that of a simple relay of visual information between the retina and cortex. Here we show that the dLGN receives strong excitatory input from both the retina and the superior colliculus. Thus, the dLGN is part of a specialized visual channel that provides cortex with convergent information about stimulus motion and eye movement and positioning.

"A dramatic bradycardia is induced by underwater submersion in vertebrates. The location of parasympathetic preganglionic cardiac motor neurons driving this aspect of the diving response was investigated using cFos immunohistochemistry combined with retrograde transport of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) to double-label neurons. After pericardial injections of CTB, trained rats voluntarily dove underwater, and their heart rates (HR) dropped immediately to 95 ± 2 bpm, an 80% reduction. After immunohistochemical processing, the vast majority of CTB labeled neurons were located in the reticular formation from the rostral cervical spinal cord to the facial motor nucleus, confirming previous studies. Labeled neurons caudal to the rostral ventrolateral medulla were usually spindle-shaped aligned along an oblique line running from the dorsal vagal nucleus to the ventrolateral reticular formation, while those more rostrally were multipolar with extended dendrites. Nine percent of retrogradely-labeled neurons were positive for both cFos and CTB after diving and 74% of these were found rostral to the obex. CTB also was transported transganglionically in primary afferent fibers, resulting in large granular deposits in dorsolateral, ventrolateral, and commissural subnuclei of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) and finer deposits in lamina I and IV-V of the trigeminocervical complex. The overlap of parasympathetic preganglionic cardiac motor neurons activated by diving with those activated by baro- and chemoreceptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla is discussed. Thus, the profound bradycardia seen with underwater submersion reinforces the notion that the mammalian diving response is the most powerful autonomic reflex known.

"BACKGROUND: Small mammals are crucial for the life history of ixodid ticks, but their role and importance in the transmission cycle of tick-borne pathogens is mostly unknown. Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis (CNM) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum are both tick-borne pathogens, and rodents are discussed to serve as main reservoir hosts for CNM but not for the latter especially in Germany. Analysing the prevalence of both pathogens in small mammals and their ticks in endemic regions may help to elucidate possible transmission paths in small mammal populations and between small mammals and ticks. METHODS: In 2012 and 2013, small mammals were trapped at three different sites in Germany. DNA was extracted from different small mammal tissues, from rodent neonates, foetuses and from questing and attached ticks. DNA samples were tested for CNM and A. phagocytophilum by real-time PCR. Samples positive for A. phagocytophilum were further characterized at the 16S rRNA gene locus. RESULTS: CNM was detected in 28.6% of small mammals and in 2.2% of questing and 3.8% of attached ticks. Altogether 33 positive ticks were attached to 17 different hosts, while positive ticks per host ranged between one and seven. The prevalences for this pathogen differed significantly within small mammal populations comparing sites (χ(2): 13.3987; p: 0.0004) and between sexes. Male rodents had an approximately two times higher chance of infection than females (OR: 1.9652; 95% CI: 1.32-2.92). The prevalence for CNM was 31.8% (95% CI: 22-44) in rodent foetuses and neonates (23 of 67) from positive dams, and 60% (95% CI: 35.7-80.25) of positive gravid or recently parturient rodents (9 out of 15) had at least one positive foetus or neonate. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected at a low percentage in rodents (0-5.6%) and host-attached ticks (0.5-2.9%) with no significant differences between rodent species. However, attached nymphs were significantly more often infected than attached larvae (χ(2): 25.091; p: <0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that CNM is mainly a rodent-associated pathogen and provides evidence for a potential transplacental transmission in rodents. In contrast, most of the rodent species captured likely represent only accidental hosts for A. phagocytophilum at the investigated sites.

"BACKGROUND: Giardiasis is an important gastrointestinal parasitic disease in humans and other mammals caused by the protozoan Giardia duodenalis. This species complex is represented by genetically distinct groups (assemblages A-H) with varying zoonotic potential and host preferences. Wild rodents can harbor potentially zoonotic assemblages A and B, and the rodent-specific assemblage G. Other Giardia spp. found in these animals are Giardia muris and Giardia microti. For the latter, only limited information on genetic typing is available. It has been speculated that wild rodents might represent an important reservoir for parasites causing human giardiasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and distribution of Giardia spp. and assemblage types in wild rodents from different study sites in Germany. RESULTS: Screening of 577 wild rodents of the genera Apodemus, Microtus and Myodes, sampled at eleven study sites in Germany, revealed a high overall Giardia prevalence. Giardia species determination at the SSU rDNA gene locus revealed that Apodemus mice, depending on species, were predominantly infected with one of two distinct G. muris sequence types. Giardia microti was the predominant parasite species found in voles of the genera Microtus and Myodes. Only a few animals were positive for potentially zoonotic G. duodenalis. Subtyping at the beta-giardin (bg) and glutamine dehydrogenase (gdh) genes strongly supported the existence of different phylogenetic subgroups of G. microti that are preferentially harbored by distinct host species. CONCLUSIONS: The present study highlights the preference of G. muris for Apodemus, and G. microti for Microtus and Myodes hosts and argues for a very low prevalence of zoonotic G. duodenalis assemblages in wild rodents in Germany. It also provides evidence that G. muris and G. microti subdivide into several phylogenetically distinguishable subgroups, each of which appears to be preferentially harbored by species of a particular rodent host genus. Finally, the study expands the database of sequences relevant for sequence typing of G. muris and G. microti isolates which will greatly help future analyses of these parasites' population structure.

"Physiological equilibrium in the retina depends on coordinated work between rod and cone photoreceptors and can be compromised by the expression of mutant proteins leading to inherited retinal degeneration (IRD). IRD is a diverse group of retinal dystrophies with multifaceted molecular mechanisms that are not fully understood. In this review, we focus on the contribution of chronically activated unfolded protein response (UPR) to inherited retinal pathogenesis, placing special emphasis on studies employing genetically modified animal models. As constitutively active UPR in degenerating retinas may activate pro-apoptotic programs associated with oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory signaling, dysfunctional autophagy, free cytosolic Ca(2+) overload, and altered protein synthesis rate in the retina, we focus on the regulatory mechanisms of translational attenuation and approaches to overcoming translational attenuation in degenerating retinas. We also discuss current research on the role of the UPR mediator PERK and its downstream targets in degenerating retinas and highlight the therapeutic benefits of reprogramming PERK signaling in preclinical animal models of IRD. Finally, we describe pharmacological approaches targeting UPR in ocular diseases and consider their potential applications to IRD.

"To establish the mouse as a genetically tractable model for high-order visual processing, we characterized fine-scale retinotopic organization of visual cortex and determined functional specialization of layer 2/3 neuronal populations in seven retinotopically identified areas. Each area contains a distinct visuotopic representation and encodes a unique combination of spatiotemporal features. Areas LM, AL, RL, and AM prefer up to three times faster temporal frequencies and significantly lower spatial frequencies than V1, while V1 and PM prefer high spatial and low temporal frequencies. LI prefers both high spatial and temporal frequencies. All extrastriate areas except LI increase orientation selectivity compared to V1, and three areas are significantly more direction selective (AL, RL, and AM). Specific combinations of spatiotemporal representations further distinguish areas. These results reveal that mouse higher visual areas are functionally distinct, and separate groups of areas may be specialized for motion-related versus pattern-related computations, perhaps forming pathways analogous to dorsal and ventral streams in other species.

"BACKGROUND: The distribution of human plague risk is strongly associated with rainfall in the tropical plague foci of East Africa, but little is known about how the plague bacterium is maintained during periods between outbreaks or whether environmental drivers trigger these outbreaks. We collected small mammals and fleas over a two year period in the West Nile region of Uganda to examine how the ecological community varies seasonally in a region with areas of both high and low risk of human plague cases. METHODS: Seasonal changes in the small mammal and flea communities were examined along an elevation gradient to determine whether small mammal and flea populations exhibit differences in their response to seasonal fluctuations in precipitation, temperature, and crop harvests in areas within (above 1300 m) and outside (below 1300 m) of a model-defined plague focus. RESULTS: The abundance of two potential enzootic host species (Arvicanthis niloticus and Crocidura spp.) increased during the plague season within the plague focus, but did not show the same increase at lower elevations outside this focus. In contrast, the abundance of the domestic rat population (Rattus rattus) did not show significant seasonal fluctuations regardless of locality. Arvicanthis niloticus abundance was negatively associated with monthly precipitation at a six month lag and positively associated with current monthly temperatures, and Crocidura spp. abundance was positively associated with precipitation at a three month lag and negatively associated with current monthly temperatures. The abundance of A. niloticus and Crocidura spp. were both positively correlated with the harvest of millet and maize. CONCLUSIONS: The association between the abundance of several small mammal species and rainfall is consistent with previous models of the timing of human plague cases in relation to precipitation in the West Nile region. The seasonal increase in the abundance of key potential host species within the plague focus, but not outside of this area, suggests that changes in small mammal abundance may create favorable conditions for epizootic transmission of Y. pestis which ultimately may increase risk of human cases in this region.

"A half century after Ray Guillery's classic descriptions of cell types, axon types, and synaptic architecture of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, the functional organization of this nucleus, as well as all other thalamic nuclei, is still of enormous interest. This review will focus on two classic papers written by Ray Guillery: 'A study of Golgi preparations from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the adult cat', and 'The organization of synaptic interconnections in the laminae of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat', as well as the studies that most directly followed from the insights these landmark manuscripts provided. It is hoped that this review will honor Ray Guillery by encouraging further investigations of the synaptic organization of the dorsal thalamus.

"AIM: The influence of humans on large carnivores, including wolves, is a worldwide conservation concern. In addition, human-caused changes in carnivore density and distribution might have impacts on prey and, indirectly, on vegetation. We therefore tested wolf responses to infrastructure related to natural resource development (i.e., human footprint). LOCATION: Our study provides one of the most extensive assessments of how predators like wolves select habitat in response to various degrees of footprint across boreal ecosystems encompassing over a million square kilometers of Canada. METHODS: We deployed GPS-collars on 172 wolves, monitored movements and used a generalized functional response (GFR) model of resource selection. A functional response in habitat selection occurs when selection varies as a function of the availability of that habitat. GFRs can clarify how human-induced habitat changes are influencing wildlife across large, diverse landscapes. RESULTS: Wolves displayed a functional response to footprint. Wolves were more likely to select forest harvest cutblocks in regions with higher cutblock density (i.e., a positive functional response to high-quality habitats for ungulate prey) and to select for higher road density in regions where road density was high (i.e., a positive functional response to human-created travel routes). Wolves were more likely to use cutblocks in habitats with low road densities, and more likely to use roads in habitats with low cutblock densities, except in winter when wolves were more likely to use roads regardless of cutblock density. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: These interactions suggest that wolves trade-off among human-impacted habitats, and adaptively switch from using roads to facilitate movement (while also risking encounters with humans), to using cutblocks that may have higher ungulate densities. We recommend that conservation managers consider the contextual and interacting effects of footprints when assessing impacts on carnivores. These effects likely have indirect impacts on ecosystems too, including on prey species.

"Immunity and parasites have been linked to the success of invasive species. Especially lower parasite burden in invasive populations has been suggested to enable a general downregulation of immune investment (Enemy Release and Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability Hypotheses). Simultaneously, keeping high immune competence towards potentially newly acquired parasites in the invasive range is essential to allow population growth. To investigate the variation of immune effectors of invasive species, we compared the mean and variance of multiple immune effectors in the context of parasite prevalence in an invasive and a native Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) population. Three of ten immune effectors measured showed higher variance in the invasive population. Mean levels were higher in the invasive population for three effectors but lower for eosinophil granulocytes. Parasite prevalence depended on the parasite taxa investigated. We suggest that variation of specific immune effectors, which may be important for invasion success, may lead to higher variance and enable invasive species to reduce the overall physiological cost of immunity while maintaining the ability to efficiently defend against novel parasites encountered.

"The invasion of a species can cause population reduction or extinction of a similar native species due to replacement competition. There is a potential risk that the native Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) may eventually be competitively excluded by the invasive North American beaver (C. canadensis) from areas where they overlap in Eurasia. Yet currently available methods of census and population estimates are costly and time-consuming. In a laboratory environment, we investigated the potential of using dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) as a conservation tool to determine whether the Eurasian or the North American beaver is present in a specific beaver colony. We hypothesized that dogs can discriminate between the two beaver species, via the odorant signal of castoreum from males and females, in two floor platform experiments. We show that dogs detect scent differences between the two species, both from dead beaver samples and from scent marks collected in the field. Our results suggest that dogs can be used as an ""animal biosensor"" to discriminate olfactory signals of beaver species, however more tests are needed. Next step should be to test if dogs discern between beaver species in the field under a range of weather conditions and habitat types and use beaver samples collected from areas where the two species share the same habitat. So far, our results show that dogs can be used as a promising tool in the future to promote conservation of the native beaver species and eradication of the invasive one. We therefore conclude that dogs may be an efficient non-invasive tool to help conservationist to manage invasive species in Europe, and advocate for European wildlife agencies to invest in this new tool.

"The influence of host diversity on multi-host pathogen transmission and persistence can be confounded by the large number of species and biological interactions that can characterize many transmission systems. For vector-borne pathogens, the composition of host communities has been hypothesized to affect transmission; however, the specific characteristics of host communities that affect transmission remain largely unknown. We tested the hypothesis that vector host use and force of infection (i.e., the summed number of infectious mosquitoes resulting from feeding upon each vertebrate host within a community of hosts), and not simply host diversity or richness, determine local infection rates of West Nile virus (WNV) in mosquito vectors. In suburban Chicago, Illinois, USA, we estimated community force of infection for West Nile virus using data on Culex pipiens mosquito host selection and WNV vertebrate reservoir competence for each host species in multiple residential and semi-natural study sites. We found host community force of infection interacted with avian diversity to influence WNV infection in Culex mosquitoes across the study area. Two avian species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius) and the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), produced 95.8% of the infectious Cx. pipiens mosquitoes and showed a significant positive association with WNV infection in Culex spp. mosquitoes. Therefore, indices of community structure, such as species diversity or richness, may not be reliable indicators of transmission risk at fine spatial scales in vector-borne disease systems. Rather, robust assessment of local transmission risk should incorporate heterogeneity in vector host feeding and variation in vertebrate reservoir competence at the spatial scale of vector-host interaction.

"American sweetgum Liquidambar styraciflua (Altingiaceae) was first introduced to China over 60 years ago. It is an important tree species for increasing landscape value and promoting afforestation in urbanized areas of eastern China in the past 20 years. Sweetgum inscriber Acanthotomicus suncei (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a local bark beetle pest and lethal to the introduced American sweetgum. To provide preliminary estimates of the potential economic losses caused by the sweetgum inscriber, a field investigation was conducted to survey the beetles' natural distribution in China. Based on field collections, potential distribution was predicted using Maxent. All nurseries stocking American sweetgum were in the high and very high suitability area of sweetgum inscriber. Additionally, we employed a model of direct loss incorporating tree and removal cost. A questionnaire was sent to maintenance companies, growers, and gardener associations for tree removal prices. We estimated the removal cost of each tree. In addition, the market price and inventory were also gained from telephone interview. Our economic analysis indicates that if sweetgum inscriber were to become established in the main American sweetgum business, the potential losses of nursery stock and urban area could range from USD 12.81 to 14.41 million.

"Ticks are widespread parasites of vertebrates and major vectors of pathogens to humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. In southern Africa, numerous tick species transmit diseases of economic and health importance. This study aimed to describe the occurrence of ticks and tick-borne pathogens in multiple land-use types and the possible role of ticks in the transmission of pathogen species. Using molecular techniques, we screened 1716 ticks for infection by rickettsial bacteria and protozoans. To characterize pathogen identity, we sequenced multiple loci from positive samples and analyzed sequences within a phylogenetic framework. Across the seven tick species collected as nymphs or adults, we detected Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Babesia, Hepatozoon, and Theileira species. We found that some tick species and tick-borne pathogens differed according to land use. For example, we found a higher density of Haemaphysalis elliptica and higher prevalence of Rickettsia in H. elliptica collected from savanna grasses used for livestock grazing near human settlements than savanna grasses in conservation areas. These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive surveillance to achieve a full understanding of the diversity and ecology of the tick-borne pathogens that can infect humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.

"BACKGROUND: The auto-dissemination approach has been shown effective at treating cryptic refugia that remain unaffected by existing mosquito control methods. This approach relies on adult mosquito behavior to spread larvicide to breeding sites at levels that are lethal to immature mosquitoes. Prior studies demonstrate that 'dissemination stations,' deployed in mosquito-infested areas, can contaminate adult mosquitoes, which subsequently deliver the larvicide to breeding sites. In some situations, however, preventative measures are needed, e.g., to mitigate seasonal population increases. Here we examine a novel approach that combines elements of autocidal and auto-dissemination strategies by releasing artificially reared, male mosquitoes that are contaminated with an insecticide. METHODOLOGY: Laboratory and field experiments examine for model-predicted impacts of pyriproxyfen (PPF) directly applied to adult male Aedes albopictus, including (1) the ability of PPF-treated males to cross-contaminate females and to (2) deliver PPF to breeding sites. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Similar survivorship was observed in comparisons of PPF-treated and untreated males. Males contaminated both female adults and oviposition containers in field cage tests, at levels that eliminated immature survivorship. Field trials demonstrate an ability of PPF-treated males to transmit lethal doses to introduced oviposition containers, both in the presence and absence of indigenous females. A decline in the Ae. albopictus population was observed following the introduction of PPF-treated males, which was not observed in two untreated field sites. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results demonstrate that, in cage and open field trials, adult male Ae. albopictus can tolerate PPF and contaminate, either directly or indirectly, adult females and immature breeding sites. The results support additional development of the proposed approach, in which male mosquitoes act as vehicles for insecticide delivery, including exploration of the approach with additional medically important mosquito species. The novelty and importance of this approach is an ability to safely achieve auto-dissemination at levels of intensity that may not be possible with an auto-dissemination approach that is based on indigenous females. Specifically, artificially-reared males can be released and sustained at any density required, so that the potential for impact is limited only by the practical logistics of mosquito rearing and release, rather than natural population densities and the self-limiting impact of an intervention upon them.

"Objective: To assess the clinical utilization and performance of the FilmArray® Meningitis/Encephalitis (ME) multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel in a hospital setting. Background: Rapid diagnosis and treatment of central nervous system (CNS) infections are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality. The ME panel is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rapid multiplex PCR assay that targets 14 bacteria, viruses, and fungi. Previous studies show an overall agreement of 93-99% between the ME panel and conventional diagnostic testing. However, few studies have evaluated the clinical implementation of the ME assay, which is available for routine use at our institution. Methods: We performed a single center retrospective chart review of inpatients who underwent ME panel testing from August 2016 to May 2017. Clinical, radiologic, and laboratory data were reviewed to determine the clinical significance of results. Indication for lumbar puncture (LP), time to results of the ME panel, and duration of antimicrobial therapy were evaluated. Results: Seven hundred and five inpatients underwent ME testing, of whom 480 (68.1%) had clinical suspicion for CNS infection with 416 (59.0%) receiving empiric antimicrobial treatment for CNS infection. The median time-to-result of the ME panel was 1.5 h (IQR, 1.4-1.7). Overall agreement between the ME panel results and clinico-laboratory assessment was 98.2%. Forty-five patients tested positive by ME, of which 12 (26.6%) were determined likely to be clinically insignificant. Conclusions: Routine availability of the ME panel led to overutilization of diagnostic test ordering, as demonstrated by the fact that over one-third of ME panel tests performed were ordered for patients with little or no suspicion for CNS infection. The median time from LP to ME panel result was 1.5 h (IQR, 1.4-1.7). The ME panel's rapid turn-around time contributed to the overuse of the test. Approximately one-quarter of positive ME results were deemed clinically insignificant, though the impact of these positive results requires additional evaluation. Twenty-four and forty-eight hours after the ME panel resulted, 68 and 25% of patients started on empiric therapy remained on antibiotics, respectively. The median time from diagnosis to discontinuation and/or narrowing of antibiotic coverage was 25.6 h (IQR, 3.6-42.5). Further consideration of the appropriate indications for use of the ME panel in clinical settings is required.

"The bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis, the cause of plague in humans and animals, normally has a sylvatic lifestyle, cycling between fleas and mammals. In contrast, laboratory-grown Y. pestis experiences a more constant environment and conditions that it would not normally encounter. The transition from the natural environment to the laboratory results in a vastly different set of selective pressures, and represents what could be considered domestication. Understanding the kinds of adaptations Y. pestis undergoes as it becomes domesticated will contribute to understanding the basic biology of this important pathogen. In this study, we performed a parallel serial passage experiment (PSPE) to explore the mechanisms by which Y. pestis adapts to laboratory conditions, hypothesizing that cells would undergo significant changes in virulence and nutrient acquisition systems. Two wild strains were serially passaged in 12 independent populations each for ~750 generations, after which each population was analyzed using whole-genome sequencing, LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis, and GC/MS metabolomics. We observed considerable parallel evolution in the endpoint populations, detecting multiple independent mutations in ail, pepA, and zwf, suggesting that specific selective pressures are shaping evolutionary responses. Complementary LC-MS/MS proteomic data provide physiological context to the observed mutations, and reveal regulatory changes not necessarily associated with specific mutations, including changes in amino acid metabolism and cell envelope biogenesis. Proteomic data support hypotheses generated by genomic data in addition to suggesting future mechanistic studies, indicating that future whole-genome sequencing studies be designed to leverage proteomics as a critical complement.

"Members of the family Bornaviridae produce enveloped virions containing a linear negative-sense non-segmented RNA genome of about 9 kb. Bornaviruses are found in mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. The most-studied viruses with public health and veterinary impact are Borna disease virus 1 and variegated squirrel bornavirus 1, both of which cause fatal encephalitis in humans. Several orthobornaviruses cause neurological and intestinal disorders in birds, mostly parrots. Endogenous bornavirus-like sequences occur in the genomes of various animals. This is a summary of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) Report on the family Bornaviridae, which is available at ictv.global/report/bornaviridae.

"We present a genome assembly from an individual male Sciurus carolinensis (the eastern grey squirrel; Vertebrata; Mammalia; Eutheria; Rodentia; Sciuridae). The genome sequence is 2.82 gigabases in span. The majority of the assembly (92.3%) is scaffolded into 21 chromosomal-level scaffolds, with both X and Y sex chromosomes assembled.

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic approach (including the use of novel diagnostic platforms), and treatment of select infectious and noninfectious etiologies of chronic meningitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Identification of the etiology of chronic meningitis remains challenging, with no cause identified in at least one-third of cases. Often, several serologic, CSF, and neuroimaging studies are indicated, although novel diagnostic platforms including metagenomic deep sequencing may hold promise for identifying organisms. Infectious etiologies are more common in those at risk for disseminated disease, specifically those who are immunocompromised because of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplantation, or immunosuppressant medications. An important step in identifying the etiology of chronic meningitis is assembling a multidisciplinary team of individuals, including those with specialized expertise in ophthalmology, dermatology, rheumatology, and infectious diseases, to provide guidance regarding diagnostic procedures. SUMMARY: Chronic meningitis is defined as inflammation involving the meninges that lasts at least 4 weeks and is associated with a CSF pleocytosis. Chronic meningitis has numerous possible infectious and noninfectious etiologies, making it challenging to definitively diagnose patients. Therefore, a multifaceted approach that combines history, physical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory analysis, including novel diagnostic platforms, is needed. This article focuses on key aspects of the evaluation of and approach to patients with chronic meningitis. Specific infectious etiologies and differential diagnoses of subacute and chronic meningitis, including noninfectious etiologies, are addressed.

"The mathematical modeling of ecological interactions is an essential tool in predicting the behavior of complex systems across landscapes. The scientific literature is growing with examples of models used to explore predator-prey interactions, resource selection, population growth, and dynamics of disease transmission. These models provide managers with an efficient alternative means of testing new management and control strategies without resorting to empirical testing that is often costly, time-consuming, and impractical. This chapter presents a review of four types of mathematical models used to understand and predict the spread of infectious diseases in wild animals: compartmental, metapopulation, spatial, and contact network models. Descriptions of each model’s uses and limitations are used to provide a look at the complexities involved in modeling the spread of diseases and the trade-offs that accompany selecting one modeling approach over another. Potential avenues for the improvement and use of these models in future studies are also discussed, as are specific examples of how each type of model has improved our understanding of infectious diseases in populations of wild animals.

"In previous studies, we demonstrated in mice and prairie dogs that simultaneous administration of two recombinant raccoon poxviruses (rRCN) expressing Yersinia pestis antigens (F1 and V307-a truncated version of the V protein) provided superior protection against plague challenge compared to individual single antigen constructs. To reduce costs of vaccine production and facilitate implementation of a sylvatic plague vaccine (SPV) control program for prairie dogs, a dual antigen construct is more desirable. Here we report the construction and characterization of a novel RCN-vectored vaccine that simultaneously expresses both F1 and V307 antigens. This dual antigen vaccine provided similar levels of protection against plague in both mice and prairie dogs as compared to simultaneous administration of the two single antigen constructs and was also shown to protect mice against an F1 negative strain of Y. pestis. The equivalent safety, immunogenicity and efficacy profile of the dual RCN-F1/V307 construct warrants further evaluation in field efficacy studies in sylvatic plague endemic areas.

"Habitat selection is a process that spans space, time and individual life histories. Ecological analyses of animal distributions and preferences are most accurate when they account for inherent dynamics of the habitat selection process. Strong territoriality can constrain perception of habitat availability by individual animals or groups attempting to colonize or establish new territory. Because habitat selection is a function of habitat availability, broad-scale changes in habitat availability or occupancy can drive density-dependent habitat functional responses. We investigated density-dependent habitat selection over a 19-year period of grey wolf (Canis lupus) recovery in Michigan, USA, using a generalized linear mixed model framework to develop a resource selection probability function (RSPF) with habitat coefficients conditioned on random effects for wolf packs and random year intercepts. In addition, we allowed habitat coefficients to vary as interactions with increasing wolf density over space and time. Results indicated that pack presence was driven by factors representing topography, human development, winter prey availability, forest structure, roads, streams and snow. Importantly, responses to many of these predictors were density-dependent. Spatio-temporal dynamics and population changes can cause considerable variation in wildlife-habitat relationships, possibly confounding interpretation of conventional habitat selection models. By incorporating territoriality into an RSPF analysis, we determined that wolves' habitat use in Michigan shifted over time, for example, exhibiting declining responses to winter prey indices and switching from positive to negative responses with respect to stream densities. We consider this an important example of a habitat functional response in wolves, driven by colonization, density-dependence and changes in occupancy during a time period of range expansion and population increase.

"MHC class I proteins mediate functions in anti-pathogen defense. MHC diversity has already been investigated by many studies in model avian species, but here we chose the bar-headed goose, a worldwide migrant bird, as a non-model avian species. Sequences from exons encoding the peptide-binding region (PBR) of MHC class I molecules were isolated from liver genomic DNA, to investigate variation in these genes. These are the first MHC class I partial sequences of the bar-headed goose to be reported. A preliminary analysis suggests the presence of at least four MHC class I genes, which share great similarity with those of the goose and duck. A phylogenetic analysis of bar-headed goose, goose and duck MHC class I sequences using the NJ method supports the idea that they all cluster within the anseriforms clade.

"Novel diseases are increasingly emerging into human populations through the complex—and often, unseen—stepwise process of spillover from a combination of wildlife, livestock, vectors, and the abiotic environment. Characterizing and modeling the spillover interface are a key part of how eco-epidemiologists respond to the growing global burden of emerging infectious diseases; but the diversity of pathogen life cycles and transmission modes poses a complex challenge for ecologists and clinicians alike. We review our current understanding of the spillover process and present a framework that relates spillover rates and human-to-human transmissibility to the basic reproduction number (R (0)). Using pathogens that exemplify important transmission pathways (anthrax, Ebola, influenza, and Zika), we illustrate key aspects of the spillover interface and discuss implications to public health and management of emerging infectious disease.

"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a serious public health problem in the People's Republic of China. Although 7 sero/genotypes of hantaviruses have been found in rodents, only Hantaan virus (carried by Apodemus agrarius mice) and Seoul virus (carried by Rattus norvegicus rats) reportedly cause disease in humans. During 1950-2007, a total of 1,557,622 cases of HFRS in humans and 46,427 deaths (3%) were reported in China. HFRS has been reported in 29 of 31 provinces in China. After implementation of comprehensive preventive measures, including vaccination, in the past decade in China, incidence of HFRS has dramatically decreased; only 11,248 HFRS cases were reported in 2007. Mortality rates also declined from the highest level of 14.2% in 1969 to ?1% during 1995-2007. However, the numbers of HFRS cases and deaths in China remain the highest in the world.

"Modelling the spatial spread of vector-borne zoonotic pathogens maintained in enzootic transmission cycles remains a major challenge. The best available spatio-temporal data on pathogen spread often take the form of human disease surveillance data. By applying a classic ecological approach-occupancy modelling-to an epidemiological question of disease spread, we used surveillance data to examine the latent ecological invasion of tick-borne pathogens. Over the last half-century, previously undescribed tick-borne pathogens including the agents of Lyme disease and human babesiosis have rapidly spread across the northeast United States. Despite their epidemiological importance, the mechanisms of tick-borne pathogen invasion and drivers underlying the distinct invasion trajectories of the co-vectored pathogens remain unresolved. Our approach allowed us to estimate the unobserved ecological processes underlying pathogen spread while accounting for imperfect detection of human cases. Our model predicts that tick-borne diseases spread in a diffusion-like manner with occasional long-distance dispersal and that babesiosis spread exhibits strong dependence on Lyme disease.

"Aleutian disease (AD) poses a serious threat to both free-ranging and farmed mink around the world. The disease is caused by the Aleutian mink disease virus (AMDV), which also poses a health risk for other members of the family Mustelidae, including wild mink, weasels, badgers and other animal species. This article analyses the seroprevalence of AMDV infections in mink and other species around the world, and reviews recent knowledge relating to the molecular epidemiology of the AMDV. Depending on the applied diagnostic technique and the country, the prevalence of anti-AMDV antibodies or AMDV DNA was established at 21.60-100.00% in farmed American mink, 0.00-93.30% in free-ranging American mink and 0.00-25.00% in European mink. Anti-AMDV antibodies or AMDV DNA were also detected in other free-living fur-bearing animals in Europe and Canada, where their prevalence was determined at 0.00-32.00% and 0.00-70.50%, respectively. This may indicate a potential threat to various animal species. AMDV strains are not clustered into genotypes based on the geographic origin, year of isolation or pathogenicity. The isolates that were identified on mink farms around the world originated from North America because American mink were introduced to Europe and Asia for breeding purposes and to restock natural populations.

"Rewilding is a novel approach to ecological restoration. Trophic rewilding in particular aims to reinstate ecological functions, especially trophic interactions, through the introduction of animals. We consider the potential for trophic rewilding to address biological invasions. In this broad review, we note some of the important conceptual and ethical foundations of rewilding, including a focus on ecosystem function rather than composition, reliance on animal agency, and an appeal to an ethic of coexistence. Second, we use theory from invasion biology to highlight pathways by which rewilding might prevent or mitigate the impacts of an invasion, including increasing biotic resistance. Third, we use a series of case studies to illustrate how reintroductions can mitigate the impacts of invasions. These include reintroductions and positive management of carnivores and herbivores including European pine martens (Martes martes), Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra), dingoes (Canis dingo), Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) and tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes). Fourth, we consider the risk that rewilding may enable a biological invasion or aggravate its impacts. Lastly, we highlight lessons that rewilding science might take from invasion biology.This article is part of the theme issue 'Trophic rewilding: consequences for ecosystems under global change'.

"The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) exacts compensatory movements of the extraocular muscles in response to stimulation of the semicircular canals to allow gaze fixation during head movements. In this study, the spatial relationships of these muscles and canals were investigated to assess their relative alignments in mammalian species commonly used in studies of the VOR. The head region of each specimen was scanned using magnetic resonance imaging and 28 anatomical landmarks were recorded from the images to define the six extraocular muscles and the anatomical planes of the three semicircular canals. The vector rotation of a semicircular canal that does not stimulate either of its two sister canals, referred to as the prime direction, was also calculated as an estimate of the maximal response plane. Significant misalignments were found between the extraocular muscles and the canals by which they are principally stimulated in most of the species under study. The deviations from parallel orientation were most pronounced in the human and rabbit samples. There were also significant departures from orthogonality between the semicircular canals in most species. Only the guinea pig displayed no significant difference from 90 degrees in any of its three inter-canal angles, although humans and rabbits deviated from orthogonality in just one semicircular canal pair - the anterior and posterior canals. The prime directions were found to deviate considerably from the anatomical canal planes (by over 20 degrees in rats). However, these deviations were not always compensatory, i.e. prime planes were not always more closely aligned with the muscle planes. Results support the view that the vestibular frame remains relatively stable and that the spatial mismatch with the extraocular co-ordinate frame is principally driven by realignment of the muscles as a result of changes in the position of the orbits within the skull (orbital convergence and frontation).

"In October 2018, the order Mononegavirales was amended by the establishment of three new families and three new genera, abolishment of two genera, and creation of 28 novel species. This article presents the updated taxonomy of the order Mononegavirales as now accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).

"Space competition effects are well-known in many microbiological and ecological systems. Here we analyze such an effect in human populations. The Neolithic transition (change from foraging to farming) was mainly the outcome of a demographic process that spread gradually throughout Europe from the Near East. In Northern Europe, archaeological data show a slowdown on the Neolithic rate of spread that can be related to a high indigenous (Mesolithic) population density hindering the advance as a result of the space competition between the two populations. We measure this slowdown from a database of 902 Early Neolithic sites and develop a time-delayed reaction-diffusion model with space competition between Neolithic and Mesolithic populations, to predict the observed speeds. The comparison of the predicted speed with the observations and with a previous non-delayed model show that both effects, the time delay effect due to the generation lag and the space competition between populations, are crucial in order to understand the observations.

"The rapid development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, including advances in sequencing chemistry, sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and data interpretation, has facilitated its wide clinical application in precision medicine. This review describes current sequencing technologies, including short- and long-read sequencing technologies, and highlights the clinical application of NGS in inherited diseases, oncology, and infectious diseases. We review NGS approaches and clinical diagnosis for constitutional disorders; summarize the application of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved NGS panels, cancer biomarkers, minimal residual disease, and liquid biopsy in clinical oncology; and consider epidemiological surveillance, identification of pathogens, and the importance of host microbiome in infectious diseases. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future perspectives of clinical NGS tests.

"This work is a molecular epidemiologic study to detect the incidence of Coxiella burnetii in rodents on Heixiazi Island at the Sino-Russian border of Heilongjiang Province. Liver tissues were extracted and processed to test the incidence of C. burnetii infection using polymerase chain reaction analysis. In total, 18% (66 of 370) of rodents tested positive for infection. The results of logistic regression analysis indicated that infection with C. burnetii was associated significantly with weight and month of capture, and infection was found in all rodent species that were observed; there was no significant difference of sex on the infection of C. burnetii. Though phylogenetic analysis disclosed heterogeneity in the nucleotide sequences isolated from the island rodents, the majority of observed strains were among the most common strains found worldwide. This is the first report on the incidence of C. burnetii in rodents on Heixiazi Island at the Sino-Russian border.

"Fever is the leading cause of paediatric outpatient consultations in Sub-Saharan Africa. Although most are suspected to be of viral origin, a putative causative pathogen is not identified in over a quarter of these febrile episodes. Using a de novo assembly sequencing approach, we report the detection (15.4%) of dicistroviruses (DicV) RNA in sera collected from 692 febrile Tanzanian children. In contrast, DicV RNA was only detected in 1/77 (1.3%) plasma samples from febrile Tanzanian adults, suggesting that children could represent the primary susceptible population. Estimated viral load by specific quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay ranged from < 1.32E3 to 1.44E7 viral RNA copies/mL serum. Three DicV full-length genomes were obtained, and a phylogenetic analyse on the capsid region showed the presence of two clusters representing tentative novel genus. Although DicV-positive cases were detected throughout the year, a significantly higher positivity rate was observed during the rainy season. This study reveals that novel DicV RNA is frequently detected in the blood of Tanzanian children, paving the way for further investigations to determine if DicV possibly represent a new agent in humans.

"BACKGROUND: Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases emerge from increased interactions between humans, other animals, and infected ticks. The risk of acquiring a tick-borne infection varies across space and time, so knowledge of the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens in ticks can facilitate disease diagnosis in a specific area and the implementation of mitigation measures and awareness campaigns. Here we identify the occurrence and prevalence of several pathogens in Ixodes ricinus ticks in Wester Ross, Northwest Scotland, a region of high tourism and tick exposure, yet data-poor in terms of tick-borne pathogens. METHODS: Questing I. ricinus nymphs (n = 2828) were collected from 26 sites in 2018 and 2019 and tested for the presence of tick-borne pathogens using PCR-based methods. Prevalence was compared with other regions of Scotland, England, Wales, and the Netherlands. RESULTS: Anaplasma phagocytophilum (4.7% prevalence), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) (2.2%), Babesia from clade X (0.2%), Rickettsia helvetica (0.04%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (0.4%) were detected, but no Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Borrelia miyamotoi, or Babesia microti. Typing of A. phagocytophilum using a fragment of the GroEL gene identified the presence of both ecotype I and ecotype II. Genospecies identification of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. revealed B. afzelii (53% of infected nymphs), B. garinii (9%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (7%), and B. valaisiana (31%). We found similar prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in Wester Ross as in the Netherlands, but higher than in other parts of Great Britain. We found lower B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence than in England or the Netherlands, and similar to some other Scottish studies. We found higher prevalence of B. valaisiana and lower prevalence of B. garinii than in other Scottish studies. We found S. ixodetis at much lower prevalence than in the Netherlands, and R. helvetica at much lower prevalence than in England and the Netherlands. CONCLUSIONS: As far as we know, this is the first description of S. ixodetis in Great Britain. The results are relevant for disease surveillance and management for public and veterinary health. The findings can also aid in designing targeted public health campaigns and in raising awareness among outdoor recreationists and professionals.

"BACKGROUND: The zoonotic parasite, Giardia duodenalis (syns. G. lamblia and G. intestinalis), has been widely reported in humans and animals, including rodents. The bamboo rat, a rodent species belonged to the subfamily Rhizomyinae, is farmed in China because of its medicinal and edible values. However, no information of G. duodenalis infection was available in bamboo rats prior to the present study. Here, the prevalence and genetic diversity of G. duodenalis in bamboo rats from Hunan Province of China were investigated. RESULTS: Of 480 faecal samples collected from six farms located in four cities (Wugang, Chenzhou, Huaihua and Jishou) of Hunan Province, 52 (10.8%) were positive for G. duodenalis infection by using a nested PCR approach targeting the beta giardin (bg) gene. Significant differences (P < 0.01) in prevalence were found among different age groups and geographical localities, and among different farms in Wugang city. Sequence analysis revealed existence of the zoonotic assemblage B and genetic diversity of G. duodenalis in these animals. Multilocus genotyping analysis also indicated broad genetic diversity of assemblage B isolates in these bamboo rats. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the infection and genetic variations of G. duodenalis in bamboo rats. These findings will provide basic data for implementing effective strategies to control giardiasis in bamboo rats.

"During the worldwide shutdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many reports emerged of urban wildlife sightings. While these images garnered public interest and declarations of wildlife reclaiming cities, it is unclear whether wildlife truly reoccupied urban areas or whether there were simply increased detections of urban wildlife during this time. Here, we detail key questions and needs for monitoring wildlife during the COVID-19 shutdown and then link these with future needs and actions with the intent of improving conservation within urban ecosystems. We discuss the tools ecologists and conservation scientists can use to safely and effectively study urban wildlife during the shutdown. With a coordinated, multicity effort, researchers and community scientists can rigorously investigate the responses of wildlife to changes in human activities, which can help us address long-standing questions in urban ecology, inspire conservation of wildlife, and inform the design of sustainable cities.

"The trading and keeping of exotic pets are associated with animal welfare, conservation, environmental protection, agricultural animal health, and public health concerns and present serious regulatory challenges to legislators and enforcers. Most legislation concerning exotic pet trading and keeping involves restricting or banning problematic species, a practice known as ""negative listing"". However, an alternative approach adopted by some governments permits only the keeping of animals that meet certain scientifically proven criteria as suitable in respect of species, environmental, and public health and safety protections. We conducted an evaluation of positive lists for the regulation of pet trading and keeping within the context of the more prevalent system of restricting or prohibiting species via negative lists. Our examination of international, national, and regional regulations in Europe, the United States, and Canada found that criteria used for the development of both negative and positive lists were inconsistent or non-specific. Our online surveys of governments received limited responses, although telephone interviews with officials from governments either considering or developing positive lists provided useful insights into their attitudes and motivations towards adopting positive lists. We discuss key issues raised by civil servants including perceived advantages of positive lists and anticipated challenges when developing lists of suitable species. In addition, we compare functions of negative and positive lists, and recommend key principles that we hope will be helpful to governments concerning development and implementation of regulations based on positive lists.

"Molecular diagnostic tools have played an important role in improving our understanding of the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis, which are two of the most important waterborne parasites in industrialized nations. Genotyping tools are frequently used in the identification of host-adapted Cryptosporidium species and G. duodenalis assemblages, allowing the assessment of infection sources in humans and public health potential of parasites found in animals and the environment. In contrast, subtyping tools are more often used in case linkages, advanced tracking of infections sources, and assessment of disease burdens attributable to anthroponotic and zoonotic transmission. More recently, multilocus typing tools have been developed for population genetic characterizations of transmission dynamics and delineation of mechanisms for the emergence of virulent subtypes. With the recent development in next generation sequencing techniques, whole genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis are increasingly used in characterizing Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis. The use of these tools in epidemiologic studies has identified significant differences in the transmission of Cryptosporidium spp. in humans between developing countries and industrialized nations, especially the role of zoonotic transmission in human infection. Geographic differences are also present in the distribution of G. duodenalis assemblages A and B in humans. In contrast, there is little evidence for widespread zoonotic transmission of giardiasis in both developing and industrialized countries. Differences in virulence have been identified among Cryptosporidium species and subtypes, and possibly between G. duodenalis assemblages A and B, and genetic recombination has been identified as one mechanism for the emergence of virulent C. hominis subtypes. These recent advances are providing insight into the epidemiology of waterborne protozoan parasites in both developing and developed countries.

"In spite of increasing public health concerns about the potential risks associated with swimming in waters contaminated with waterfowl feces, little is known about the composition of the gut microbial community of aquatic birds. To address this, a gull 16S rRNA gene clone library was developed and analyzed to determine the identities of fecal bacteria. Analysis of 282 16S rRNA gene clones demonstrated that the gull gut bacterial community is mostly composed of populations closely related to Bacilli (37%), Clostridia (17%), Gammaproteobacteria (11%), and Bacteriodetes (1%). Interestingly, a considerable number of sequences (i.e., 26%) were closely related to Catellicoccus marimammalium, a gram-positive, catalase-negative bacterium. To determine the occurrence of C. marimammalium in waterfowl, species-specific 16S rRNA gene PCR and real-time assays were developed and used to test fecal DNA extracts from different bird (n = 13) and mammal (n = 26) species. The results showed that both assays were specific to gull fecal DNA and that C. marimammalium was present in gull fecal samples collected from the five locations in North America (California, Georgia, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Toronto, Canada) tested. Additionally, 48 DNA extracts from waters collected from six sites in southern California, Great Lakes in Michigan, Lake Erie in Ohio, and Lake Ontario in Canada presumed to be impacted with gull feces were positive by the C. marimammalium assay. Due to the widespread presence of this species in gulls and environmental waters contaminated with gull feces, targeting this bacterial species might be useful for detecting gull fecal contamination in waterfowl-impacted waters.

"Parasites are integral to ecosystem functioning yet often overlooked. Improved understanding of host-parasite associations is important, particularly for wide-ranging species for which host range shifts and climate change could alter host-parasite interactions and their effects on ecosystem function.Among the most widely distributed mammals with diverse diets, gray wolves (Canis lupus) host parasites that are transmitted among canids and via prey species. Wolf-parasite associations may therefore influence the population dynamics and ecological functions of both wolves and their prey. Our goal was to identify large-scale processes that shape host-parasite interactions across populations, with the wolf as a model organism.By compiling data from various studies, we examined the fecal prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in six wolf populations from two continents in relation to wolf density, diet diversity, and other ecological conditions.As expected, we found that the fecal prevalence of parasites transmitted directly to wolves via contact with other canids or their excreta was positively associated with wolf density. Contrary to our expectations, the fecal prevalence of parasites transmitted via prey was negatively associated with prey diversity. We also found that parasite communities reflected landscape characteristics and specific prey items available to wolves.Several parasite taxa identified in this study, including hookworms and coccidian protozoans, can cause morbidity and mortality in canids, especially in pups, or in combination with other stressors. The density-prevalence relationship for parasites with simple life cycles may reflect a regulatory role of gastrointestinal parasites on wolf populations. Our result that fecal prevalence of parasites was lower in wolves with more diverse diets could provide insight into the mechanisms by which biodiversity may regulate disease. A diverse suite of predator-prey interactions could regulate the effects of parasitism on prey populations and mitigate the transmission of infectious agents, including zoonoses, spread via trophic interactions.

"Continuous exposure to human activity has led to considerable behavioural changes in some wildlife populations. Animals are more likely to survive in a changing environment by adjusting their behaviour to repeatedly occurring but harmless stimulations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, starting in late 2019, face masks were recommended to the public to prevent the spread of pathogens. In this context, we compared the flight initiation distance (FID) of the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus), a commonly seen bird across China, in Yibin and Dazhou, Sichuan, in response to people with or without face masks. After continuous exposure to people wearing face masks for nearly six months, sparrows evidently became adapted to people wearing face masks, and correspondingly showed shorter FIDs in response to people wearing masks. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that birds show reduced fear responses to people wearing face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results suggest a novel aspect of short-term adaptation of wildlife to human behaviour, and that the learning ability of sparrows allows them to adjust their behaviours to adapt to such subtle changes in the environment.

"Bartonella spp. are erythrocytic bacteria transmitted via arthropod vectors, which infect a broad range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. We investigated transmission dynamics and host-parasite-vector relationships for potentially zoonotic Bartonella spp. in invasive Rattus rattus hosts and associated arthropod ectoparasites in Madagascar. We identified five distinct species of Bartonella (B. elizabethae 1, B. elizabethae 2, B. phoceensis 1, B. rattimassiliensis 1, and B. tribocorum 1) infecting R. rattus rodents and their ectoparasites. We fit standard epidemiological models to species-specific age-prevalence data for the four Bartonella spp. with sufficient data, thus quantifying age-structured force of infection. Known zoonotic agents, B. elizabethae 1 and 2, were best described by models exhibiting high forces of infection in early age class individuals and allowing for recovery from infection, while B. phoceensis 1 and B. rattimassiliensis 1 were best fit by models of lifelong infection without recovery and substantially lower forces of infection. Nested sequences of B. elizabethae 1 and 2 were recovered from rodent hosts and their Synopsyllus fonquerniei and Xenopsylla cheopsis fleas, with a particularly high prevalence in the outdoor-dwelling, highland-endemic S. fonquerniei. These findings expand on force of infection analyses to elucidate the ecological niche of the zoonotic Bartonella elizabethae complex in Madagascar, hinting at a potential vector role for S. fonquerniei. Our analyses underscore the uniqueness of such ecologies for Bartonella species, which pose a variable range of potential zoonotic threats.

"Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is considered a category A priority pathogen due to its potential for high transmissibility and the significant morbidity and mortality it causes in humans. Y. pestis is endemic to the western United States and much of the world, necessitating programs to monitor for this pathogen on the landscape. Elevated human risk of plague infection has been spatially correlated with spikes in seropositive wildlife numbers, particularly rodent-eating carnivores, which are frequently in contact with the enzootic hosts and the associated arthropod vectors of Y. pestis In this study, we describe a semiautomated bead-based flow cytometric assay developed for plague monitoring in wildlife called the F1 Luminex plague assay (F1-LPA). Based upon Luminex/Bio-Plex technology, the F1-LPA targets serological responses to the F1 capsular antigen of Y. pestis and was optimized to analyze antibodies eluted from wildlife blood samples preserved on Nobuto filter paper strips. In comparative evaluations with passive hemagglutination, the gold standard tool for wildlife plague serodiagnosis, the F1-LPA demonstrated as much as 64× improvement in analytical sensitivity for F1-specific IgG detection and allowed for unambiguous classification of IgG status. The functionality of the F1-LPA was demonstrated for coyotes and other canids, which are the primary sentinels in wildlife plague monitoring, as well as felids and raccoons. Additionally, assay formats that do not require species-specific immunological reagents, which are not routinely available for several wildlife species used in plague monitoring, were determined to be functional in the F1-LPA.

"Equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) is a serious disease of horses, and its management continues to be a challenge for veterinarians. The protozoan Sarcocystis neurona is most commonly associated with EPM. S. neurona has emerged as a common cause of mortality in marine mammals, especially sea otters (Enhydra lutris). EPM-like illness has also been recorded in several other mammals, including domestic dogs and cats. This paper updates S. neurona and EPM information from the last 15 years on the advances regarding life cycle, molecular biology, epidemiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, treatment and control.

"Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and its ligands, particularly PD-L1 and PD-L2, are the most important proteins responsible for signaling T-cell inhibition and arbitrating immune homeostasis and tolerance mechanisms. However, the adaptive evolution of these genes is poorly understood. In this study, we aligned protein-coding genes from vertebrate species to evaluate positive selection constraints and evolution in the PD1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 genes conserved across up to 166 vertebrate species, with an average of 55 species per gene. We determined that although the positive selection was obvious, an average of 5.3% of codons underwent positive selection in the three genes across vertebrate lineages, and increased positive selection pressure was detected in both the Ig-like domains and transmembrane domains of the proteins. Moreover, the PD1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 genes were highly expressed in almost all tissues of the selected species indicating a distinct expression pattern in different tissues among most species. Our study reveals that adaptive selection plays a key role in the evolution of PD1 and its ligands in the majority of vertebrate species, which is in agreement with the contribution of these residues to the mechanisms of pathogen identification and coevolution in the complexity and novelties of vertebrate immune systems.

"Pangolins are the world's most trafficked non-human mammals. A significant number of Temminck's pangolins (Smutsia temminckii) are presented for veterinary care and rehabilitation in southern Africa. Little is known about the physiology and normal health of this species, making diagnosis and medical management difficult. This study aimed to establish reference intervals (RIs) for hematology and plasma clinical chemistry in the Temminck's pangolin. RIs were generated according to international guidelines using samples from 27 healthy free-living (n = 18) and rehabilitated (n = 9) pangolins. Hematology was performed using the Abaxis VetScan HM5 analyzer with manual differentials; clinical chemistry was performed using heparin plasma on the Abaxis VetScan VS2 and Cobas Integra 400 Plus analyzers. Hematology RIs were: RBC 3.88-8.31 × 10(12)/L, HGB 73-150 g/L, HCT 26-51%, MCV 59-72 fL, MCH 15.6-21.4 pg, MCHC 257-325 g/L, RDW 14.3-19.1%, WBC 1.80-10.71 × 10(9)/L. Vetscan VS2 clinical chemistry RIs were: albumin 27-41 g/L, ALP 26-100 U/L, ALT 25-307 U/L, amylase 267-826 U/L, bilirubin 4-10 μmol/L, calcium 2.1-2.2 mmol/L, globulin 21-55 g/L, glucose 3.8-10.0 mmol/L, phosphate 1.3-2.6 mmol/L, potassium 3.6-5.9 mmol/L, sodium 132-140 mmol/L total protein 52-84 g/L, and urea 5.3-11.4 mmol/L. RIs for creatinine were not calculated as analytical imprecision exceeded analytical performance goals. Cobas Integra clinical chemistry RIs were: albumin 22-33 g/L, ALP 20-104 U/L, ALT 17-291 U/L, amylase 466-1,533 U/L, bilirubin 1-14 μmol/L, calcium 2.0-2.4 mmol/L, creatinine <58 μmol/L, globulin 23-49 g/L, glucose 3.6-10.1 mmol/L, phosphate 1.0-2.2 mmol/L, potassium 3.1-5.8 mmol/L, sodium 137-150 mmol/L, total protein 47-72 g/L, and urea 6.0-12.5 mmol/L. There was significant bias between the two chemistry analyzers for several measurands. Differences were found for some analytes between free-living and rehabilitated animals, probably reflecting differences in nutrition and hydration. These are the first RIs generated for Temminck's pangolin. These results will allow veterinarians to better determine pangolin health status, formulate optimal treatment plans and increase patient survival rates in this endangered species.

"In Europe, many flaviviruses are endemic (West Nile, Usutu, tick-borne encephalitis viruses) or occasionally imported (dengue, yellow fever viruses). Due to the temporal and geographical co-circulation of flaviviruses in Europe, flavivirus differentiation by diagnostic tests is crucial in the adaptation of surveillance and control efforts. Serological diagnosis of flavivirus infections is complicated by the antigenic similarities among the Flavivirus genus. Indeed, most flavivirus antibodies are directed against the highly immunogenic envelope protein, which contains both flavivirus cross-reactive and virus-specific epitopes. Serological assay results should thus be interpreted with care and confirmed by comparative neutralization tests using a panel of viruses known to circulate in Europe. However, antibody cross-reactivity could be advantageous in efforts to control emerging flaviviruses because it ensures partial cross-protection. In contrast, it might also facilitate subsequent diseases, through a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement mainly described for dengue virus infections. Here, we review the serological methods commonly used in WNV diagnosis and surveillance in Europe. By examining past and current epidemiological situations in different European countries, we present the challenges involved in interpreting flavivirus serological tests and setting up appropriate surveillance programs; we also address the consequences of flavivirus circulation and vaccination for host immunity.

"Human noroviruses are structurally very simple, but how this correlates with their highly infectious nature, environmental stability, and the fact that they survive commonly used food sterilization processes remains elusive. Noroviruses are genetically very diverse, and new genogroups and genotypes are continuously being discovered. Some norovirus genotypes are more commonly found in foodborne outbreaks, suggesting that virological factors may determine virus adsorption characteristics to food surfaces and the efficiency of food-to-person transmission. Noroviruses can be found in a wide range of mammalian species, including pigs and cows that are extensively farmed for human consumption. The zoonotic potential of animal noroviruses via the food chain cannot be ignored.

"Introduction of alien species is a well-known threat to biodiversity. Where newly introduced, alien species may pose a risk for the local ecological community by competing for resources or by introducing pathogens. Sylvilagus floridanus is an American lagomorph introduced into Europe in the second half of 20th century, for hunting. This study evaluated the structure and epidemiological characteristics of the gastrointestinal parasite community in an introduced population of S. floridanus in the Province of Alessandria (Piedmont Region-Italy). Three alien parasites were reported out of 271 animals: Obeliscoides cuniculi in the stomach, Trichostrongylus calcaratus in the small intestine, and Passarulus nonnanulatus in the large intestine. All these nematodes are commonly reported in S. floridanus in its natural range, but they represent alien species in Europe. The report of these alien parasites is an example of the unexpected consequences caused by the introduction of non-native vertebrates. The documented introduction of new pathogens may alter the parasite community of the native lagomorphs, with possible long-term effects on local ecological dynamics.

"The gray squirrel is one of the most common invasive species in Europe, whose presence is dangerous for the survival of the European red squirrel. To cope with this biological invasion and to safeguard biodiversity, the LIFE+U-SAVEREDS project aims to protect the red squirrel, by limiting the growth of the current population of gray squirrels and simultaneously promoting their eradication with surgical sterilization. This study compares two different anesthetic protocols, including dexmedetomidine (40 µg/kg) and midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) associated with ketamine (15 mg/kg; n = 25 squirrels) or alfaxalone (5 mg/kg; n = 22 squirrels). A blinded investigator evaluated the quality and onset of sedation, intraoperative anesthesia, and recovery, as well as the physiologic parameters for each animal. Alfaxalone provided a good quality of anesthesia with limited cardiovascular effects (p < 0.05) and good intraoperative myorelaxation. Ketamine induced complete relaxation in a shorter time (p < 0.05) and a rapid (p < 0.001) and excellent (p < 0.05) recovery. Despite the overall superiority of ketamine, alfaxalone appeared to be an adequate alternative anesthetic drug that can be administered without requiring intravascular access. It should be rapidly metabolized and excreted; however, it requires the combination of longer acting sedatives/myorelaxants to prevent a poor recovery quality.

"The discovery of the endogenous melanocortin agonists in the 1950s have resulted in sixty years of melanocortin ligand research. Early efforts involved truncations or select modifications of the naturally occurring agonists leading to the development of many potent and selective ligands. With the identification and cloning of the five known melanocortin receptors, many ligands were improved upon through bench-top in vitro assays. Optimization of select properties resulted in ligands adopted as clinical candidates. A summary of every melanocortin ligand is outside the scope of this review. Instead, this review will focus on the following topics: classic melanocortin ligands, selective ligands, small molecule (non-peptide) ligands, ligands with sex-specific effects, bivalent and multivalent ligands, and ligands advanced to clinical trials. Each topic area will be summarized with current references to update the melanocortin field on recent progress. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Melanocortin Receptors - edited by Ya-Xiong Tao.

"Tick-borne pathogens cause infectious diseases that inflict much societal and financial hardship worldwide. Blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, are primary vectors of several epizootic and zoonotic pathogens. The aim was to find varius pathogens of I. scapularis and to determine their prevalence. In Ontario and Quebec, 113 I. scapularis ticks were collected from songbirds, mammals, including humans, and by flagging. PCR and DNA sequencing detected five different microorganisms: Anaplasma phagocytophilum, 1 (0.9%); Babesia odocoilei, 17 (15.3%); Babesia microti-like sp., 1 (0.9%); Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), 29 (26.1%); and Hepatozoon canis, 1 (0.9%). Five coinfections of Bbsl and Babesia odocoilei occurred. Notably, H. canis was documented for the first time in Canada and, at the same time, demonstrates the first transstadial passage of H. canis in I. scapularis. Transstadial passage of Bbsl and B. odocoilei was also witnessed. A novel undescribed piroplasm (Babesia microti-like) was detected. An established population of I. scapularis ticks was detected at Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec. Because songbirds widely disperse I. scapularis larvae and nymphs, exposure in an endemic area is not required to contract tick-borne zoonoses. Based on the diversity of zoonotic pathogens in I. scapularis ticks, clinicians need to be aware that people who are bitten by I. scapularis ticks may require select antimicrobial regimens.

"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulates the reproductive endocrine system in mammals. The GnRH immunocontraception vaccine can aid animal population control and management. We evaluated a recombinant GnRH fusion protein with the adjuvant MONTANIDE ISA 206 VG as a GnRH vaccine in adult male ICR mice by evaluating anti-GnRH antibodies; concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone; testis size and histomorphology; and semen quality. Response was assessed after intramuscular administration of the vaccine to mice in weeks 0, 4, and 8. The vaccine induced specific antibody response by week 5, with peak of antibody levels observed by week 13 and a declining level thereafter until the end of the study at week 24. Furthermore, it reduced serum FSH, LH, and testosterone concentrations. The vaccinated mice exhibited testicular atrophy and reduced sperm quality, concentration, morphology, and viability compared to control males. The outcomes of pairings of treated males with untreated females revealed reduced mating, pregnancy rates and number of litters compared to control pairings. Assessment of this GnRH vaccine in different species could assist its development for future applications.

"Zoonotic West Nile virus (WNV) circulates in natural transmission cycles involving certain mosquitoes and birds, horses, humans, and a range of other vertebrates are incidental hosts. Clinical infections in humans can range in severity from uncomplicated WNV fever to fatal meningoencephalitis. Since its introduction to the Western Hemisphere in 1999, WNV had spread across North America, Central and South America and the Caribbean, although the vast majority of severe human cases have occurred in the United States of America (USA) and Canada. By 2002-2003, the WNV outbreaks have involved thousands of patients causing severe neurologic disease (meningoencephalitis and poliomyelitis-like syndrome) and hundreds of associated fatalities in USA. The purpose of this review is to present recent information on the epidemiology and pathogenicity of WNV since its emergence in North America.

"To support the licensure of a new and safer vaccine to protect people against smallpox, a monkeypox model of infection in cynomolgus macaques, which simulates smallpox in humans, was used to evaluate two vaccines, Acam2000 and Imvamune, for protection against disease. Animals vaccinated with a single immunization of Imvamune were not protected completely from severe and/or lethal infection, whereas those receiving either a prime and boost of Imvamune or a single immunization with Acam2000 were protected completely. Additional parameters, including clinical observations, radiographs, viral load in blood, throat swabs, and selected tissues, vaccinia virus-specific antibody responses, immunophenotyping, extracellular cytokine levels, and histopathology were assessed. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the levels of neutralizing antibody in animals vaccinated with a single immunization of Acam2000 (132 U/ml) and the prime-boost Imvamune regime (69 U/ml) prior to challenge with monkeypox virus. After challenge, there was evidence of viral excretion from the throats of 2 of 6 animals in the prime-boost Imvamune group, whereas there was no confirmation of excreted live virus in the Acam2000 group. This evaluation of different human smallpox vaccines in cynomolgus macaques helps to provide information about optimal vaccine strategies in the absence of human challenge studies.

"The trade of non-native pets, especially of non-domesticated and exotic animals, and their subsequent release and establishment of populations is one of the major pathways of introduction for invasive alien reptiles, amphibia, birds and mammals. Here, we use a group of arboreal mammals, tree squirrels of the genus Callosciurus, as a well-documented case study, reviewing the pathways of introduction, the current areas of non-native distribution, the rate of establishment success and the challenge and legal importance of species identification. We further illustrate the importance of early detection and effective monitoring methods and plans. Next, we document how they interfere with native species, their risk of acting as vectors for emerging infectious diseases and their potential role in maintaining parasitic infections that can affect human health. We conclude by reviewing the current management, or the lack of it, and highlight the diverse biological, social, political and economic reasons that make control/eradication of these charismatic species difficult or even impractical in most countries. However, reviewing the only two successful eradications of the IAS, we highlight the need to acknowledge the public opinion and the importance of communication, transparency and the engagement of a diversity of stakeholders to create a consensus about the actions to undertake.

"Prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are used to study the aetiology and prevention of gallstones because of the similarities of prairie dog and human bile gallstone composition. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested a connection between infection with Helicobacter species and cholesterol cholelithiasis, cholecystis and gallbladder cancer. Ten of the 34 prairie dogs in this study had positive Helicobacter species identified by PCR using Helicobacter genus-specific primers. Ten of 34 prairie dogs had positive Campylobacter species identified in the intestine by PCR with Campylobacter genus-specific primers. Six Helicobacter sp. isolates and three Campylobacter sp. isolates were identified taxonomically by 16S rRNA gene analysis. The prairie dog helicobacters fell into three clusters adjacent to Helicobacter marmotae. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, three strains in two adjacent clusters were included in the species H. marmotae. Three strains were only 97.1 % similar to the sequence of H. marmotae and can be considered a novel species with the provisional designation Helicobacter sp. Prairie Dog 3. The prairie dog campylobacters formed a single novel cluster and represent a novel Campylobacter sp. with the provisional designation Campylobacter sp. Prairie Dog. They branched with Campylobacter cuniculorum at 96.3 % similarity and had the greatest sequence similarity to Campylobacter helveticus at 97.1 % similarity. Whether H. marmotae or the novel Helicobacter sp. and Campylobacter sp. identified in prairie dogs play a role in cholesterol gallstones or hepatobiliary disease requires further studies.

"Agnostic metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) has emerged as a promising single, universal pathogen detection method for infectious disease diagnostics. This methodology allows for identification and genomic characterization of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses without the need for a priori knowledge of a specific pathogen directly from clinical specimens. Although there are increasing reports of mNGS successes, several hurdles need to be addressed, such as differentiation of colonization from infection, extraneous sources of nucleic acid, method standardization, and data storage, protection, analysis, and interpretation. As more commercial and clinical microbiology laboratories develop mNGS assays, it is important for treating practitioners to understand both the power and limitations of this method as a diagnostic tool for infectious diseases.

"Wildlife conservation and management has become a very complex public policy issue in China as concerns over on animal welfare and empathy for animals have grown. Science-based conservation strategies that are oriented toward sustainable wildlife management (SWM) are under threat as these new attitudes and values emerge and take hold. This study accesses the attitudes of college students towards SWM and wildlife conservation, and investigates demographic characteristics influencing their attitudes in China, a country that is traditionally associated with consumptive use of wildlife and SWM, but where new ideas about wildlife conservation are emerging. From October 2018 to April 2019, nine universities (including ""Double First-Class"" universities, first-tier universities, second-tier universities), and four three-year colleges in China were selected as survey locations, and face-to-face interviews were conducted with 1991 students. A total of 1977 questionnaires were recovered, of which 1739 were valid, with a completion rate of 88%. A Likert seven-point scale method was used to score students' attitudes, and a classification and regression tree (CART) was used to analyze whether their attitudes were affected by their demographic characteristics. The results show that although students are broadly supportive of the theory of SWM, some are deeply antagonistic about on SWM on issues that arouse strong emotions such as ""Animal Welfare and Rights"" and ""Trophy Hunting"". Demographic characteristics of students affect their degree of support for the SWM with support for SWM lower among vegetarians, freshmen, and students who have taken environmental protection electives. This research suggests that the theory of SWM requires to be refreshed and adapted to appeal to the younger generation of Chinese students, with SWM principles integrated into the environmental education programs of universities and three-year colleges. More attention should also be attached to media publicity by the government about wildlife conservation so as to enhance awareness of the need for SWM.

"Toxoplasmosis is one of the most prevalent infections in humans and animals caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). Rodents, as intermediate and reservoir hosts, play a key role in the maintenance and transmission of T. gondii. They can be contaminated and maintain the parasite in the form of cysts in their bodies, demonstrating an infection source for their offsprings, predators (particularly felids), and other animals. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis study was carried out to evaluate the global seroprevalence of T. gondii in these mammals. For achieving the purpose of the current study, six English databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched for related studies from 1970 to 2018. Finally, a total of 52,372 records were screened, 105 records including 26,221 rodents were incorporated in the present study. By random effect models, the overall seroprevalence was calculated at 6% (95% CI = 6-7%), with the highest amount was observed in Africa (24%) and South America (18%), and the lowest amount in Europe (1%). The subgroup data analysis by gender manifested that the prevalence of Immunoglobulin G antibodies did not differ between genders (P > 0.05). Due to the significant heterogeneity, meta-regression models were applied based on serological techniques and continental regions; however, the obtained values were not statistically significant (P = 0.480 and P = 0.295, respectively). The present study revealed a relatively low level of T. gondii seroprevalence in rodents; however, if they were the main food source for their predators, they would cause high transmission of T. gondii.

"Maximizing animal wellbeing by minimizing drug-related side effects is a key consideration when choosing pharmaceutical agents for chemical restraint in nonhuman primates. One drug combination that may promote this ideology is butorphanol (27.3 mg/mL), azaperone (9.1 mg/mL), and medetomidine (10.9 mg/mL; BAM). Based on results from a pilot study, 2 doses of BAM (16 and 24 μL/kg IM) were compared in healthy, 3-y-old rhesus macaques. Physiologic parameters and anesthetic quality were assessed and recorded every 5 min. Experimental endpoints were established for hypoxemia (85% or less peripheral oxygen saturation with oxygen supplementation), pulse rate (80 bpm or less for 2 consecutive readings), mean arterial pressure (MAP; 50 mm Hg or less), and hypothermia (97 °F or less); if any endpoint was achieved, medetomidine was reversed by using atipamezole (0.22 mg/kg IM). Both BAM doses resulted in immobilization of all animals with no clinically significant differences between groups. All animals initially exhibited hypoxemia that resolved with oxygen supplementation. Regardless of dose, most macaques (71%) reached established experimental endpoints for bradycardia (62 to 80 bpm) or hypotension (44 to 50 mm Hg MAP). Given the results of this study, our recommendation regarding the use of 16- or 24-μL/kg BAM for immobilizing rhesus macaques is dependent on caution regarding cardiopulmonary parameters and the provision of supplemental oxygen.

"Plague, caused by the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis, is a vector-borne disease that has caused millions of human deaths over several centuries. Presently, human plague infections continue throughout the world. Transmission from one host to another relies mainly on infected flea bites, which can cause enlarged lymph nodes called buboes, followed by septicemic dissemination of the pathogen. Additionally, droplet inhalation after close contact with infected mammals can result in primary pneumonic plague. Here, we review research advances in the areas of vaccines and therapeutics for plague in context of Y. pestis virulence factors and disease pathogenesis. Plague continues to be both a public health threat and a biodefense concern and we highlight research that is important for infection mitigation and disease treatment.

"Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the cat can be obtained from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyses of fur. This study developed miniplexes using SNPs with high discriminating power for random-bred domestic cats, focusing on individual and phenotypic identification. Seventy-eight SNPs were investigated using a multiplex PCR followed by a fluorescently labeled single base extension (SBE) technique (SNaPshot(®) ). The SNP miniplexes were evaluated for reliability, reproducibility, sensitivity, species specificity, detection limitations, and assignment accuracy. Six SNPplexes were developed containing 39 intergenic SNPs and 26 phenotypic SNPs, including a sex identification marker, ZFXY. The combined random match probability (cRMP) was 6.58 × 10(-19) across all Western cat populations and the likelihood ratio was 1.52 × 10(18) . These SNPplexes can distinguish individual cats and their phenotypic traits, which could provide insight into crime reconstructions. A SNP database of 237 cats from 13 worldwide populations is now available for forensic applications.

"The theory of regulation in animal populations is fundamental to understanding the dynamics of populations, the causes of mortality and how natural selection shapes the life history of species. In mammals, the great range in body size allows us to see how allometric relationships affect the mode of regulation. Resource limitation is the fundamental cause of regulation. Top-down limitation through predators is determined by four factors: (i). body size; (ii). the diversity of predators and prey in the system; (iii). whether prey are resident or migratory; and (iv). the presence of alternative prey for predators. Body size in mammals has two important consequences. First, mammals, particularly large species, can act as keystones that determine the diversity of an ecosystem. I show how keystone processes can, in principle, be measured using the example of the wildebeest in the Serengeti ecosystem. Second, mammals act as ecological landscapers by altering vegetation succession. Mammals alter physical structure, ecological function and species diversity in most terrestrial biomes. In general, there is a close interaction between allometry, population regulation, life history and ecosystem dynamics. These relationships are relevant to applied aspects of conservation and pest management.

"Borreliae are divided into three groups, namely the Lyme group (LG), the Echidna-Reptile group (REPG) and the Relapsing Fever group (RFG). Currently, only Borrelia of the Lyme and RF groups (not all) cause infection in humans. Borreliae of the Echidna-Reptile group represent a new monophyletic group of spirochaetes, which infect amphibians and reptiles. In addition to a general description of the phylum Spirochaetales, including a brief historical digression on spirochaetosis, in the present review Borreliae of Lyme and Echidna-Reptile groups are described, discussing the ecology with vectors and hosts as well as microbiological features and molecular characterization. Furthermore, differences between LG and RFG are discussed with respect to the clinical manifestations. In humans, LG Borreliae are organotropic and cause erythema migrans in the early phase of the disease, while RFG Borreliae give high spirochaetemia with fever, without the development of erythema migrans. With respect of LG Borreliae, recently Borrelia mayonii, with intermediate characteristics between LG and RFG, has been identified. As part of the LG, it gives erythema migrans but also high spirochaetemia with fever. Hard ticks are vectors for both LG and REPG groups, but in LG they are mostly Ixodes sp. ticks, while in REPG vectors do not belong to that genus.

"Numerous examples exist of successful mammalian invasive alien species (IAS) eradications from small islands (<10 km(2) ), but few from more extensive areas. We review 15 large-scale removals (mean area 2627 km(2) ) from Northern Europe since 1900, including edible dormouse, muskrat, coypu, Himalayan porcupine, Pallas' and grey squirrels and American mink, each primarily based on daily checking of static traps. Objectives included true eradication or complete removal to a buffer zone, as distinct from other programmes that involved local control to limit damage or spread. Twelve eradication/removal programmes (80%) were successful. Cost increased with and was best predicted by area, while the cost per unit area decreased; the number of individual animals removed did not add significantly to the model. Doubling the area controlled reduced cost per unit area by 10%, but there was no evidence that cost effectiveness had increased through time. Compared with small islands, larger-scale programmes followed similar patterns of effort in relation to area. However, they brought challenges when defining boundaries and consequent uncertainties around costs, the definition of their objectives, confirmation of success and different considerations for managing recolonisation. Novel technologies or increased use of volunteers may reduce costs. Rapid response to new incursions is recommended as best practice rather than large-scale control to reduce the environmental, financial and welfare costs. © 2016 Crown copyright.

"Heavy metals are considered a continuous threat to humanity, as they cannot be eradicated. Prolonged exposure to heavy metals/metalloids in humans has been associated with several health risks, including neurodegeneration, vascular dysfunction, metabolic disorders, cancer, etc. Small blood vessels are highly vulnerable to heavy metals as they are directly exposed to the blood circulatory system, which has comparatively higher concentration of heavy metals than other organs. Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is an umbrella term used to describe various pathological processes that affect the cerebral small blood vessels and is accepted as a primary contributor in associated disorders, such as dementia, cognitive disabilities, mood disorder, and ischemic, as well as a hemorrhagic stroke. In this review, we discuss the possible implication of heavy metals/metalloid exposure in CSVD and its associated disorders based on in-vitro, preclinical, and clinical evidences. We briefly discuss the CSVD, prevalence, epidemiology, and risk factors for development such as genetic, traditional, and environmental factors. Toxic effects of specific heavy metal/metalloid intoxication (As, Cd, Pb, Hg, and Cu) in the small vessel associated endothelium and vascular dysfunction too have been reviewed. An attempt has been made to highlight the possible molecular mechanism involved in the pathophysiology, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory pathway, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression, and amyloid angiopathy in the CSVD and related disorders. Finally, we discussed the role of cellular antioxidant defense enzymes to neutralize the toxic effect, and also highlighted the potential reversal strategies to combat heavy metal-induced vascular changes. In conclusion, heavy metals in small vessels are strongly associated with the development as well as the progression of CSVD. Chelation therapy may be an effective strategy to reduce the toxic metal load and the associated complications.

"Programs that aim to control vector-borne zoonotic diseases require information on zoonotic hosts and on the feeding behavior of bridging vectors that are capable of transmitting pathogens from those hosts to humans. Here we describe an assay developed to identify bloodmeals in field-collected cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis Bouché) to assess this species' potential role as a Yersinia pestis bridging vector in a plague-endemic region of Uganda. Our assay uses a single primer set and SYBR Green I-based real-time polymerase chain reaction to amplify a segment of the 12S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA gene for identification by sequencing. The assay capitalizes on the sensitivity of real-time polymerase chain reaction and the specificity of sequencing and can be used to differentiate vertebrate bloodmeals to the genus or species level without a priori knowledge of the host community. Because real-time assays that detect vertebrate DNA are highly sensitive to human DNA contamination, we analyzed detection in artificially fed and unfed fleas to establish a Ct cutoff that optimized specificity without completely sacrificing sensitivity. Using the established cutoff, our assay detected human, rat, and goat DNA in artificially fed C. felis up to 72 h postfeeding.

"Although cancer and aging have been studied as independent diseases, mounting evidence suggests that cancer is an aging-associated disease and that cancer and aging share many molecular pathways. In particular, recent studies validated telomerase activation as a potential therapeutic target for age-related diseases; in addition, abnormal telomerase expression and telomerase mutations have been associated with many different types of human tumor. Here, we revisit the connection between telomerase and cancer and aging in light of recent findings supporting a role for telomerase not only in telomere elongation, but also in metabolic fitness and Wnt activation. Understanding the physiological impact of telomerase regulation is fundamental given the therapeutic strategies that are being developed that involve telomerase modulation.

"Minimizing the pain or discomfort of research animals through refinement of surgical techniques is inherent in the humane use of animals in investigative studies. The current approach for intraperitoneal implantation of radiotelemetry devices in mice is a ventral midline incision. An optional surgical approach is a flank incision. We used multidimensional analysis to compare midline and flank approaches for implantation of radiotelemetry devices in regard to time of surgery, activity, temperature, food intake, gel intake, body weight, and vitality scores. A third group was used to evaluate the effects of buprenorphine in healthy mice. The study demonstrated positive benefits related to the flank approach, including quicker surgery times, improved activity levels, more stable temperature homeostasis, smaller losses in body weight, and quicker return to presurgical baseline levels of food intake. In addition, direct effects of buprenorphine included decreases in food intake and body weight, with the effects on body weight lasting approximately 8 d after treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that implantation of intraperitoneal radiotelemetry devices by using a flank approach is beneficial to mice.

"Borna disease has been assessed according to the criteria of the Animal Health Law (AHL), in particular criteria of Article 7 on disease profile and impacts, Article 5 on the eligibility of Borna disease to be listed, Article 9 for the categorisation of Borna disease according to disease prevention and control rules as in Annex IV and Article 8 on the list of animal species related to Borna disease. The assessment has been performed following a methodology composed of information collection and compilation, expert judgement on each criterion at individual and, if no consensus was reached before, also at collective level. The output is composed of the categorical answer, and for the questions where no consensus was reached, the different supporting views are reported. Details on the methodology used for this assessment are explained in a separate opinion. According to the assessment performed, Borna disease cannot be considered eligible to be listed for Union intervention as laid down in Article 5(3) of the AHL because there was no compliance on criterion 5 A(v). Consequently, the assessment on compliance of Borna disease with the criteria as in Annex IV of the AHL, for the application of the disease prevention and control rules referred to in Article 9(1) is not applicable, as well as which animal species can be considered to be listed for Borna disease according to Article 8(3) of the AHL.

"Many disease systems exhibit complexities not captured by current theoretical and empirical work. In particular, systems with multiple host species and multiple infectious agents (i.e., multi-host, multi-agent systems) require novel methods to extend the wealth of knowledge acquired studying primarily single-host, single-agent systems. We outline eight challenges in multi-host, multi-agent systems that could substantively increase our knowledge of the drivers and broader ecosystem effects of infectious disease dynamics.

"The housefly feeds and reproduces in animal manure and decaying organic substances and thus lives in intimate association with various microorganisms including human pathogens. In order to understand the variation and association between bacteria and the housefly, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to describe bacterial communities of 90 individual houseflies collected within and between ten dairy farms in Denmark. Analysis of gene sequences showed that the most abundant classes of bacteria found across all sites included Bacilli, Clostridia, Actinobacteria, Flavobacteria, and all classes of Proteobacteria and at the genus level the most abundant genera included Corynebacterium, Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Vagococcus, Weissella, Lactococcus, and Aerococcus. Comparison of the microbiota of houseflies revealed a highly diverse microbiota compared to other insect species and with most variation in species richness and diversity found between individuals, but not locations. Our study is the first in-depth amplicon sequencing study of the housefly microbiota, and collectively shows that the microbiota of single houseflies is highly diverse and differs between individuals likely to reflect the lifestyle of the housefly. We suggest that these results should be taken into account when addressing the transmission of pathogens by the housefly and assessing the vector competence variation under natural conditions.

"Mastomys are the most widespread African rodent and carriers of various diseases such as the plague or Lassa virus. In addition, mastomys have rapidly gained a large number of mammary glands. Here, we generated a genome, variome, and transcriptomes for Mastomys coucha. As mastomys diverged at similar times from mouse and rat, we demonstrate their utility as a comparative genomic tool for these commonly used animal models. Furthermore, we identified over 500 mastomys accelerated regions, often residing near important mammary developmental genes or within their exons leading to protein sequence changes. Functional characterization of a noncoding mastomys accelerated region, located in the HoxD locus, showed enhancer activity in mouse developing mammary glands. Combined, our results provide genomic resources for mastomys and highlight their potential both as a comparative genomic tool and for the identification of mammary gland number determining factors.

"Vector-borne microbes are subject to the ecological constraints of two distinct microenvironments: that in the arthropod vector and that in the blood of its vertebrate host. Because the structure of bacterial communities in these two microenvironments may substantially affect the abundance of vector-borne microbes, it is important to understand the relationship between bacterial communities in both microenvironments and the determinants that shape them. We used pyrosequencing analyses to compare the structure of bacterial communities in Synosternus cleopatrae fleas and in the blood of their Gerbillus andersoni hosts. We also monitored the interindividual and seasonal variability in these bacterial communities by sampling the same individual wild rodents during the spring and again during the summer. We show that the bacterial communities in each sample type (blood, female flea or male flea) had a similar phylotype composition among host individuals, but exhibited seasonal variability that was not directly associated with host characteristics. The structure of bacterial communities in male fleas and in the blood of their rodent hosts was remarkably similar and was dominated by flea-borne Bartonella and Mycoplasma phylotypes. A lower abundance of flea-borne bacteria and the presence of Wolbachia phylotypes distinguished bacterial communities in female fleas from those in male fleas and in rodent blood. These results suggest that the overall abundance of a certain vector-borne microbe is more likely to be determined by the abundance of endosymbiotic bacteria in the vector, abundance of other vector-borne microbes co-occurring in the vector and in the host blood and by seasonal changes, than by host characteristics.

"Twice a year in southwestern Nigeria, during a traditional bat festival, community participants enter designated caves to capture bats, which are then consumed for food or traded. We investigated the presence of Bartonella species in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) and bat flies (Eucampsipoda africana) from these caves and assessed whether Bartonella infections had occurred in persons from the surrounding communities. Our results indicate that these bats and flies harbor Bartonella strains, which multilocus sequence typing indicated probably represent a novel Bartonella species, proposed as Bartonella rousetti. In serum from 8 of 204 persons, we detected antibodies to B. rousetti without cross-reactivity to other Bartonella species. This work suggests that bat-associated Bartonella strains might be capable of infecting humans.

"BACKGROUND: Vector-borne pathogens must overcome arthropod infection and escape barriers (e.g. midgut and salivary glands) during the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) before subsequent transmission to another host. This particular timespan is undetermined for the etiological agent of flea-borne spotted fever (Rickettsia felis). Artificial acquisition of R. felis by blood-feeding cat fleas revealed dissemination to the salivary glands after seven days; however, this length of time is inconsistent with co-feeding studies that produced infectious cat fleas within 24 h of infection. In the current study, we demonstrated that an alternative mechanism is responsible for the early-phase transmission that typifies flea-borne R. felis spread. METHODS: Co-feeding transmission bioassays were constructed to assess temporal dynamics of R. felis amongst cat fleas, including exposure time to produce infectious fleas and association time to transmit infection to naïve fleas. Additional experiments examined the proportion of R. felis-exposed cat fleas with contaminated mouthparts, as well as the likelihood for cat fleas to release R. felis from their mouthparts following exposure to an infectious bloodmeal. The potential for mechanical transmission of R. felis by co-feeding cat fleas was further examined using fluorescent latex beads, as opposed to a live pathogen, which would not require a biological mechanism to achieve transmission. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that R. felis-infected cat fleas were infectious to naïve fleas less than 24 h after exposure to the pathogen, but showed no rickettsial dissemination to the salivary glands during this early-phase transmission. Additionally, the current study revealed that R. felis-infected cat fleas must co-feed with naïve fleas for more than 12 h in order for early-phase transmission to occur. Further evidence supported that contaminated flea mouthparts may be the source of the bacteria transmitted early, and demonstrated that R. felis is released from the mouthparts during brief probing events. Moreover, the use of fluorescent latex beads supports the notion that early-phase transmission of R. felis is a mechanical mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of the transmission mechanisms utilized by R. felis is essential to fully understand the vulnerability of susceptible vertebrate hosts, including humans, to this pathogen.

"Since 2000, scientists and students from the greater Rocky Mountain region, along with invited speakers, both national and international, have gathered at the Mountain Campus of Colorado State University to discuss their area of study, present recent findings, establish or strengthen collaborations, and mentor the next generation of virologists and prionologists through formal presentations and informal discussions concerning science, grantsmanship and network development. This year, approximately 100 people attended the 17th annual Rocky Mountain Virology Association meeting, that began with a keynote presentation, and featured 29 oral and 35 poster presentations covering RNA and DNA viruses, prions, virus-host interactions and guides to successful mentorship. Since the keynote address focused on the structure and function of Zika and related flaviviruses, a special session was held to discuss RNA control. The secluded meeting at the foot of the Colorado Rocky Mountains gave ample time for in-depth discussions amid the peak of fall colors in the aspen groves while the random bear provided excitement. On behalf of the Rocky Mountain Virology Association, this report summarizes the >50 reports.

"Movement of individuals promotes colonization of new areas, gene flow among local populations, and has implications for the spread of infectious agents and the control of pest species. Wild Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are common in highly urbanized areas but surprisingly little is known of their population structure. We sampled individuals from 11 locations within Baltimore, Maryland, to characterize the genetic structure and extent of gene flow between areas within the city. Clustering methods and a neighbour-joining tree based on pairwise genetic distances supported an east-west division in the inner city, and a third cluster comprised of historically more recent sites. Most individuals (approximately 95%) were assigned to their area of capture, indicating strong site fidelity. Moreover, the axial dispersal distance of rats (62 m) fell within typical alley length. Several rats were assigned to areas 2-11.5 km away, indicating some, albeit infrequent, long-distance movement within the city. Although individual movement appears to be limited (30-150 m), locations up to 1.7 km are comprised of relatives. Moderate F(ST), differentiation between identified clusters, and high allelic diversity indicate that regular gene flow, either via recruitment or migration, has prevented isolation. Therefore, ecology of commensal rodents in urban areas and life-history characteristics of Norway rats likely counteract many expected effects of isolation or founder events. An understanding of levels of connectivity of rat populations inhabiting urban areas provides information about the spatial scale at which populations of rats may spread disease, invade new areas, or be eradicated from an existing area without reinvasion.

"Puumala virus is an RNA virus hosted by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and is today present in most European countries. Whilst it is generally accepted that hantaviruses have been tightly co-evolving with their hosts, Puumala virus (PUUV) evolutionary history is still controversial and so far has not been studied at the whole European level. This study attempts to reconstruct the phylogeographical spread of modern PUUV throughout Europe during the last postglacial period in the light of an upgraded dataset of complete PUUV small (S) segment sequences and by using most recent computational approaches. Taking advantage of the knowledge on the past migrations of its host, we identified at least three potential independent dispersal routes of PUUV during postglacial recolonization of Europe by the bank vole. From the Alpe-Adrian region (Balkan, Austria, and Hungary) to Western European countries (Germany, France, Belgium, and Netherland), and South Scandinavia. From the vicinity of Carpathian Mountains to the Baltic countries and to Poland, Russia, and Finland. The dissemination towards Denmark and North Scandinavia is more hypothetical and probably involved several independent streams from south and north Fennoscandia.

"Many pathogens encode proteases that serve to antagonize the host immune system. In particular, viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome [(+)ssRNA], including picornaviruses, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses, encode proteases that are not only required for processing viral polyproteins into functional units but also manipulate crucial host cellular processes through their proteolytic activity. Because these proteases must cleave numerous polyprotein sites as well as diverse host targets, evolution of these viral proteases is expected to be highly constrained. However, despite this strong evolutionary constraint, mounting evidence suggests that viral proteases such as picornavirus 3C, flavivirus NS3, and coronavirus 3CL, are engaged in molecular 'arms races' with their targeted host factors, resulting in host- and virus-specific determinants of protease cleavage. In cases where protease-mediated cleavage results in host immune inactivation, recurrent host gene evolution can result in avoidance of cleavage by viral proteases. In other cases, such as recently described examples in NLRP1 and CARD8, hosts have evolved 'tripwire' sequences that mimic protease cleavage sites and activate an immune response upon cleavage. In both cases, host evolution may be responsible for driving viral protease evolution, helping explain why viral proteases and polyprotein sites are divergent among related viruses despite such strong evolutionary constraint. Importantly, these evolutionary conflicts result in diverse protease-host interactions even within closely related host and viral species, thereby contributing to host range, zoonotic potential, and pathogenicity of viral infection. Such examples highlight the importance of examining viral protease-host interactions through an evolutionary lens.

"Shared enemies may instigate or modify competitive interactions between species. The dis-equilibrium caused by non-native species introductions has revealed that the outcome of such indirect interactions can often be dramatic. However, studies of enemy-mediated competition mostly consider the impact of a single enemy, despite species being embedded in complex networks of interactions. Here, we demonstrate that native red and invasive grey squirrels in Britain, two terrestrial species linked by resource and disease-mediated apparent competition, are also now linked by a second enemy-mediated relationship involving a shared native predator recovering from historical persecution, the European pine marten. Through combining spatial capture-recapture techniques to estimate pine marten density, and squirrel site-occupancy data, we find that the impact of exposure to predation is highly asymmetrical, with non-native grey squirrel occupancy strongly negatively affected by exposure to pine martens. By contrast, exposure to pine marten predation has an indirect positive effect on red squirrel populations. Pine marten predation thus reverses the well-documented outcome of resource and apparent competition between red and grey squirrels.

"The 14th International Workshops on Opportunistic Protists (IWOP-14) was held August 10-12, 2017 in Cincinnati, OH, USA. The IWOP meetings focus on opportunistic protists (OIs); for example, free-living amoebae, Pneumocystis spp., Cryptosporidium spp., Toxoplasma, the Microsporidia, and kinetoplastid flagellates. The highlights of Pneumocystis spp. research included the reports of primary homothallism for mating; a potential requirement for sexual replication in its life cycle; a new antigen on the surface of small asci; roles for CLRs, Dectin-1, and Mincle in host responses; and identification of MSG families and mechanisms used for surface variation. Studies of Cryptosporidia spp. included comparative genomics, a new cryopreservation method; the role of mucin in attachment and invasion, and epidemiological surveys illustrating species diversity in animals. One of the five identified proteins in the polar tube of Microsporidia, PTP4, was shown to play a role in host infection. Zebrafish were used as a low cost vertebrate animal model for an evaluation of potential anti-toxoplasma drugs. Folk medicine compounds with anti-toxoplasma activity were presented, and reports on the chronic toxoplasma infection provided evidence for increased tractability for the study of this difficult life cycle stage. Escape from the parasitophorus vacuole and cell cycle regulation were the topics of the study in the acute phase.

"Adaptation of the viral life cycle to host cells is necessary for efficient viral infection and replication. This evolutionary process has contributed to the mechanism for determining the host range of viruses. Orthobornaviruses, members of the family Bornaviridae, are non-segmented, negative-strand RNA viruses, and several genotypes have been isolated from different vertebrate species. Previous studies revealed that some genotypes isolated from avian species can replicate in mammalian cell lines, suggesting the zoonotic potential of avian orthobornaviruses. However, the mechanism by which the host specificity of orthobornaviruses is determined has not yet been identified. In this study, we found that the infectivity of orthobornaviruses is not determined at the viral entry step, mediated by the viral glycoprotein and matrix protein. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence in the viral nucleoprotein (N) has evolved under natural selection and determines the host-specific viral polymerase activity. A chimeric mammalian orthobornavirus, which has the NLS sequence of avian orthobornavirus N, exhibited a reduced propagation efficiency in mammalian cells. Our findings indicated that nuclear transport of the viral N is a determinant of the host range of orthobornaviruses, providing insights into the evolution and host adaptation of orthobornaviruses.

"Three great plague pandemics, resulting in nearly 200 million deaths in human history and usage as a biowarfare agent, have made Yersinia pestis as one of the most virulent human pathogens. In late 2017, a large plague outbreak raged in Madagascar attracted extensive attention and caused regional panics. The evolution of local outbreaks into a pandemic is a concern of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in plague endemic regions. Until now, no licensed plague vaccine is available. Prophylactic vaccination counteracting this disease is certainly a primary choice for its long-term prevention. In this review, we summarize the latest advances in research and development of plague vaccines.

"The composition of wildlife communities can have strong effects on transmission of zoonotic vector-borne pathogens, with more diverse communities often supporting lower infection prevalence in vectors (dilution effect). The introduced Burmese python, Python bivittatus, is eliminating large and medium-sized mammals throughout southern Florida, USA, impacting local communities and the ecology of zoonotic pathogens. We investigated invasive predator-mediated impacts on ecology of Everglades virus (EVEV), a zoonotic pathogen endemic to Florida that circulates in mosquito-rodent cycle. Using binomial generalized linear mixed effects models of field data at areas of high and low python densities, we show that increasing diversity of dilution host (non-rodent mammals) is associated with decreasing blood meals on amplifying hosts (cotton rats), and that increasing cotton rat host use is associated with increasing EVEV infection in vector mosquitoes. The Burmese python has caused a dramatic decrease in mammal diversity in southern Florida, which has shifted vector host use towards EVEV amplifying hosts (rodents), resulting in an indirect increase in EVEV infection prevalence in vector mosquitoes, putatively elevating human transmission risk. Our results indicate that an invasive predator can impact wildlife communities in ways that indirectly affect human health, highlighting the need for conserving biological diversity and natural communities.

"Metagenomics is currently the only generic method for pathogen detection. Starting from RNA allows the assessment of the whole sample community including RNA viruses. Here we present our modular concerted protocol for sample processing for diagnostic metagenomics analysis of human, animal, and food samples. The workflow does not rely on dedicated amplification steps at any stage in the process and, in contrast to published methods, libraries prepared accordingly will yield only minute amounts of unclassifiable reads. We confirmed the performance of the approach using a spectrum of pathogen/matrix-combinations showing it has the potential to become a commonly usable analytical framework.

"Recently, Borna disease virus (BoDV-1)-related fatal encephalitis human cases have been reported, which highlights the potential of BoDV-1 to cause fatal human diseases. To protect the infected brain from lethal damage, it is critical to control BoDV-1 as quickly as possible. At present, antivirals against BoDV-1 are limited, and therefore, novel types of antivirals are needed. Here, we developed a novel treatment using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against BoDV-1. We screened several siRNAs targeting the viral N, M, and L genes for BoDV-1-reducing activity. Among the screened candidates, we chose two siRNAs that efficiently decreased the BoDV-1 load in persistently BoDV-1-infected cells to prepare a siRNA cocktail (TD-Borna) for BoDV-1 treatment. TD-Borna successfully reduced the BoDV-1 load without enhancing the risk of emergence of escape mutants. The combination of TD-Borna and T-705, a previously reported antiviral agent against bornaviruses, decreased the BoDV-1 load more efficiently than TD-Borna or T-705 alone. Furthermore, TD-Borna efficiently decreased the BoDV-1 load in BoDV-1-infected neuron-derived cells, in which T-705 did not decrease the viral load. Overall, we developed a novel antiviral candidate against BoDV-1, TD-Borna, that can be used in combination with T-705 and is effective against BoDV-1 in neuron-derived cells, in which T-705 is less effective. Considering that BoDV-1 is highly neurotropic, TD-Borna can offer a promising option to improve the outcome of BoDV-1 infection.

"Extended phenotypes are manifestations of genes that occur outside of the organism that possess those genes. In spite of their widespread occurrence, the role of extended phenotypes in evolutionary biology is still a matter of debate. Here, we explore the indirect effects of extended phenotypes, especially their shared use, in the fitness of simulated individuals and populations. A computer simulation platform was developed in which different populations were compared regarding their ability to produce, use, and share extended phenotypes. Our results show that populations that produce and share extended phenotypes outrun populations that only produce them. A specific parameter in the simulations, a bonus for sharing extended phenotypes among conspecifics, has a more significant impact in defining which population will prevail. All these findings strongly support the view, postulated by the extended fitness hypothesis (EFH) that extended phenotypes play a significant role at the population level and their shared use increases population fitness. Our simulation platform is available at https://github.com/guilherme-araujo/gsop-dist.

"In recent years, an increasing number of studies have reported that intestinal microbiota have an important effect on tumour immunity by affecting the tumour microenvironment (TME). The intestinal microbiota are closely associated with various immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, natural killer cells (NK cells) and macrophages. Some bacteria, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) and Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri), have been shown to improve the effect of tumour immunity. Furthermore, microbial imbalance, such as the increased abundance of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Helicobacter hepaticus (H. hepaticus), generally causes tumour formation and progression. In addition, some microbiota also play important roles in tumour immunotherapy, especially PD-L1-related therapies. Therefore, what is the relationship between these processes and how do they affect each other? In this review, we summarize the interactions and corresponding mechanisms among the intestinal microbiota, immune system and TME to facilitate the research and development of new targeted drugs and provide new approaches to tumour therapy.

"Three major plague pandemics caused by the gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis have killed nearly 200 million people in human history. Due to its extreme virulence and the ease of its transmission, Y. pestis has been used purposefully for biowarfare in the past. Currently, plague epidemics are still breaking out sporadically in most of parts of the world, including the United States. Approximately 2000 cases of plague are reported each year to the World Health Organization. However, the potential use of the bacteria in modern times as an agent of bioterrorism and the emergence of a Y. pestis strain resistant to eight antibiotics bring out severe public health concerns. Therefore, prophylactic vaccination against this disease holds the brightest prospect for its long-term prevention. Here, we summarize the progress of the current vaccine development for counteracting plague.

"A 4.7-kb region of DNA sequence contained at the right end of the myxoma virus EcoRI-G2 fragment located 24 kb from the right end of the 163-kb genome has been determined. This region of the myxoma virus genome encodes homologs of the vaccinia virus genes A51R, A52R, A55R, A56R, and B1R; the myxoma virus gene equivalents have been given the prefix M. The MA55 gene encodes a protein belonging to the kelch family of actin-binding proteins, while the MA56 gene encodes a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily related to a variety of cellular receptors and adhesion molecules. A novel myxoma virus early gene, MST3N, is a member of the eukaryotic sialyltransferase gene family located between genes MA51 and MA52. Detergent lysates prepared from myxoma virus-infected cell cultures contained a virally encoded sialyltransferase activity that catalyzed the transfer of sialic acid (Sia) from CMP-Sia to an asialofetuin glycoprotein acceptor. Analysis of the in vitro-sialylated glycoprotein acceptor by digestion with N-glycosidase F and by lectin binding suggested that the MST3N gene encodes an enzyme with Galbeta1,3(4)GlcNAc alpha2,3-sialyltransferase specificity for the N-linked oligosaccharide of glycoprotein. Lectin binding assays demonstrated that alpha2,3-sialyltransferase activity is expressed by several known leporipoxviruses that naturally infect Sylvilagus rabbits. The sialyltransferase is nonessential for myxoma virus replication in cell culture; however, disruption of the MST3N gene caused attenuation in vivo. The possible implications of the myxoma virus-expressed sialyltransferase in terms of the host's defenses against infection are discussed.

"Many circuits in the mammalian brain are organized in a topographic or columnar manner. These circuits could be activated-in ways that reveal circuit function or restore function after disease-by an artificial stimulation system that is capable of independently driving local groups of neurons. Here we present a simple custom microscope called ProjectorScope 1 that incorporates off-the-shelf parts and a liquid crystal display (LCD) projector to stimulate surface brain regions that express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). In principle, local optogenetic stimulation of the brain surface with optical projection systems might not produce local activation of a highly interconnected network like the cortex, because of potential stimulation of axons of passage or extended dendritic trees. However, here we demonstrate that the combination of virally mediated ChR2 expression levels and the light intensity of ProjectorScope 1 is capable of producing local spatial activation with a resolution of ∼200-300 μm. We use the system to examine the role of cortical activity in the experience-dependent emergence of motion selectivity in immature ferret visual cortex. We find that optogenetic cortical activation alone-without visual stimulation-is sufficient to produce increases in motion selectivity, suggesting the presence of a sharpening mechanism that does not require precise spatiotemporal activation of the visual system. These results demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation can sculpt the developing brain.

"Dinotefuran-Permethrin-Pyriproxyfen (DPP) is used to kill and repel mosquitoes from dogs. However, the influence of the product on the host-seeking behavior of mosquitoes remains unknown. The interference of DPP with the host selection of unfed female Aedes albopictus was investigated. A total of 18 animals (9 mice and 9 rats) were divided into three groups of six animals each. DU: DPP treated rats (n = 3) with untreated mice (n = 3), UD: DPP treated mice (n = 3) with untreated rats (n = 3) and control UU: untreated mice (n = 3) and untreated rats (n = 3). In each group, the rats and mice were placed 30 cm apart. After sedation, the animals in each group were exposed twice (Day 1 and Day 7 post-treatment) for one hour to 71 ± 3 female mosquitoes. Mosquitoes were categorized after the 2-h post-exposure period as dead or alive. Blood-meal origin was determined from mosquitoes using a newly customized duplex qPCR. The highest values of forage ratio (1.36 ≥ wi ≤ 1.88) and selection index (0.63 ≥ Bi ≤ 0.94) for rat hosts indicates a preference of mosquitoes for this species as compared to mice when co-housed during the exposure. The mosquitoes only seldom fed on mice, even in the untreated group. The anti-feeding effect of DPP was therefore only assessed on rat's hosts. The results showed that DPP, when directly applied on rats, provided a direct protection of 82% and 61% on Day 1 and Day 7, respectively, while when applied on mice hosts (UD), the DPP provided an indirect protection of 21% and 10% on Day 1 and Day 7, respectively. The results showed also that DPP, when applied on rats, provided a direct protection against Ae. albopictus bites. This effect did not result in increased exposure of the untreated host placed in the same cage at a distance of 30 cm.

"Overlapping genes originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which nucleotide substitutions in a pre-existing frame induce the expression of a de novo protein from an alternative frame. In this study, I assembled a dataset of 319 viral overlapping genes, which included 82 overlaps whose expression is experimentally known and the respective 237 homologs. Principal component analysis revealed that overlapping genes have a common pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Discriminant analysis separated overlapping from non-overlapping genes with an accuracy of 97%. When applied to overlapping genes with known genealogy, it separated ancestral from de novo frames with an accuracy close to 100%. This high discriminant power was crucial to computationally design variants of de novo viral proteins known to possess selective anticancer toxicity (apoptin) or protection against neurodegeneration (X protein), as well as to detect two new potential overlapping genes in the genome of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

"After the emergence of African swine fever (ASF), the wild boar population numbers fell drastically in Eastern Europe. This situation made it possible to verify the changes in the wolves' diet that occurred. The material collection was carried out in two regions, Grodno and Vitebsk, in Belarus. In total, 19 species/groups of prey were observed in the gray wolf diet, but the most important were wild boar, elk, red deer, roe deer and beaver. The decrease in the number of wild boar caused changes in the diet of wolves but only in Vitebsk region, where wolves' diet before the ASF epidemic outbreak consisted mainly of elk and wild boar. After the decrease of wild boar numbers, wolves still mainly hunted elk, but other types of prey included roe deer, red deer and beaver. We found a negative correlation between wild boar and both deer species (roe deer and red deer) in the wolves' diet. Moreover, the more the wolves consumed elk, the less they consumed beaver. In our opinion, only intensive hunting of wolves by humans can explain the resulting dietary fluctuations between elk and beaver, as well as the fact that wolves did not turn to other food sources.

"Loss of genetic variation due to population bottlenecks may be a severe threat for the survival of endangered species. Assessment and maintenance of genetic variability are thus crucial for conservation programs related to endangered populations. Scandinavian beavers went through an extensive bottleneck during the last century due to overhunting. In Sweden the species became extirpated but in Norway extinction was avoided by legal protection. Following reintroductions of small numbers of remaining Norwegian animals in 1922-1939, the Swedish population has increased tremendously, now harboring 100,000 animals. We show here that this viable population of beavers possesses extremely low levels of genetic variability at DNA fingerprinting loci and monomorphism at major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II loci. A similar pattern was also evident among Norwegian beavers but low levels of genetic variability were not a characteristic of the species since Russian conspecifics displayed substantial DNA fingerprinting polymorphism. However, the Russian animals were monomorphic at MHC loci, indicating that the European beaver is exceptional in its low level of MHC variability. The results demonstrate that a conservation program can be successful despite low levels of genetic variation in the founder population.

"Most viral pathogens in humans have animal origins and arose through cross-species transmission. Over the past 50 years, several viruses, including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, have been linked back to various bat species. Despite decades of research into bats and the pathogens they carry, the fields of bat virus ecology and molecular biology are still nascent, with many questions largely unexplored, thus hindering our ability to anticipate and prepare for the next viral outbreak. In this Review, we discuss the latest advancements and understanding of bat-borne viruses, reflecting on current knowledge gaps and outlining the potential routes for future research as well as for outbreak response and prevention efforts.

"Patients with central nervous system (CNS) infection experience very high levels of morbidity and mortality, in part because of the many challenges inherent to the diagnosis of CNS infection and identification of a causative pathogen. The clinical presentation of CNS infection is nonspecific, so clinicians must often order and interpret many diagnostic tests in parallel. This can be a daunting task given the large number of potential pathogens and the availability of different testing modalities. Here, we review traditional diagnostic techniques including Gram stain and culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We highlight which of these are recommended for the pathogens most commonly tested among U.S. patients with suspected CNS infection. Finally, we describe the newer broad-range diagnostic approaches, multiplex PCR and metagenomic sequencing, which are increasingly used in clinical practice.

"As the threat of exposure to emerging and reemerging viruses within a naïve population increases, it is vital that the basic mechanisms of pathogenesis and immune response be thoroughly investigated. Recent outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus, Ebola virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus illustrate the emerging threats that are encountered. By utilizing animal models in this endeavor, the host response to viruses can be studied in a more complex and integrated context to identify novel drug targets, and assess the efficacy and safety of new products rapidly. This is especially true in the advent and implementation of the FDA animal rule. Although no one animal model is able to recapitulate all aspects of human disease, understanding the current limitations allows for a more targeted experimental design. Important facets to consider prior to an animal study are route of viral exposure, species of animal, biomarkers of disease, and a humane endpoint. This chapter covers the current animal models for medically important human viruses, and demonstrates where the gaps in knowledge exist.

"Wildlife vaccination is an important tool for managing the burden of infectious disease in human populations, domesticated livestock and various iconic wildlife. Although substantial progress has been made in the field of vaccine designs for wildlife, there is a gap in our understanding of how to time wildlife vaccination, relative to host demography, to best protect a population.We use a mathematical model and computer simulations to assess the outcomes of vaccination campaigns that deploy vaccines once per annual population cycle.Optimal timing of vaccination is an important consideration in animals with short to intermediate life spans and a short birthing season. Vaccines that are deployed shortly after the birthing season best protect the host population.The importance of timing is greater in wildlife pathogens that have a high rate of transmission and a short recovery period. Vaccinating at the end of the birthing season best reduces the mean abundance of pathogen-infected hosts. Delaying vaccination until later in the year can facilitate pathogen elimination. Policy Implications. Tuning wildlife vaccination campaigns to host demography and pathogen traits can substantially increase the effectiveness of a campaign. Our results suggest that, for a fluctuating population, vaccinating at, or shortly after, the end of the birthing season, best protects the population against an invading pathogen. If the pathogen is already endemic, delaying vaccination until after the birthing season is over can help facilitate pathogen elimination. Our results highlight the need to better understand and predict host demography in wildlife populations that are targeted for vaccination.

"To evaluate the role of Culex mosquitoes as enzootic and epidemic vectors for WNV, we identified the source of vertebrate blood by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing portions of the cytochrome b gene of mitochondrial DNA. All Cx. restuans and 93% of Cx. pipiens acquired blood from avian hosts; Cx. salinarius fed frequently on both mammals (53%) and birds (36%). Mixed-blood meals were detected in 11% and 4% of Cx. salinarius and Cx. pipiens, respectively. American robin was the most common source of vertebrate blood for Cx. pipiens (38%) and Cx. restuans (37%). American crow represented <1% of the blood meals in Cx. pipiens and none in Cx. restuans. Human-derived blood meals were identified from 2 Cx. salinarius and 1 Cx. pipiens. Results suggest that Cx. salinarius is an important bridge vector to humans, while Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans are more efficient enzootic vectors in the northeastern United States.

"The occurrence of azurocytes (AZ), a type of leukocyte unique to voles and previously described for three Microtus species, is now reported in Microtus agrestis. The goal of this study was to shed new light on the possible function and significance of these cells and on how they play a role in the natural history of rodent species. Individuals from three vole populations were sampled monthly for 2 years. A hemogram was produced for each individual, and AZ counts estimated. The counts of AZ were much higher in pregnant females, and these levels were higher the higher the past vole density. Males had low prevalences and counts, both for breeding and nonbreeding individuals, but they showed a seasonality that varied with age, body condition, and current and past vole density. Also, the occurrence of AZ in males was more likely after they had had low levels of indicators of condition, suggesting that azurocytes may result from a response to infection. Hence, overall our results suggest that, in females, these cells may be important for reproduction and may have a role in inducing abortion when conditions are not favorable, while in males they might be a response to infection.

"Smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated, through a concerted vaccination campaign led by the World Health Organization. Since its eradication, routine vaccination against smallpox has ceased, leaving the world population susceptible to disease caused by orthopoxviruses. In recent decades, reports of human disease from zoonotic orthopoxviruses have increased. Furthermore, multiple reports of newly identified poxviruses capable of causing human disease have occurred. These facts raise concerns regarding both the opportunity for these zoonotic orthopoxviruses to evolve and become a more severe public health issue, as well as the risk of Variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) to be utilized as a bioterrorist weapon. The eradication of smallpox occurred prior to the development of the majority of modern virological and molecular biological techniques. Therefore, there is a considerable amount that is not understood regarding how this solely human pathogen interacts with its host. This paper briefly recounts the history and current status of diagnostic tools, vaccines, and anti-viral therapeutics for treatment of smallpox disease. The authors discuss the importance of further research to prepare the global community should a smallpox-like virus emerge.

"Arthropod vector feeding preferences are defined as an overutilization of a particular host species given its abundance in relationship to other species in the community. Numerous methods exist to quantify vector feeding preferences; however, controlled host choice experiments are generally an underutilized approach. In this report, we present results from controlled vector host choice experiments using Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes and wild avian hosts identified as important contributors to West Nile virus (WNv) transmission in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. In each experiment, we allowed lab-reared F(1) Cx. quinquefasciatus to feed freely overnight on two avian individuals of a different species (i.e., northern cardinals, American robins, blue jays, brown thrashers, and gray catbirds). We then estimated WNv transmission potential using vectorial capacity and R(0). We found that mosquito blood feeding success was extremely variable among experimental replicates and that patterns of host choice only occasionally aggregated to a particular bird species. Vectorial capacity was highest for American robins and blue jays due to these species' higher reservoir competence for WNv and greater probabilities of mosquito selection of these species. Despite species-specific differences in vectorial capacity, total community capacity was similar among species pairs. R(0) estimates were qualitatively similar to capacity, and R(0) was below and above unity across species pairs. Our results provide empirical evidence that C. quinquefasciatus is an opportunistic blood feeder and highlight how variability in vector-host contact rates as well as host community composition can influence the likelihood of WNv transmission in avian communities.

"Neurotropic viruses infect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause acute or chronic neurologic disabilities. Regulatory T cells (Treg) play a critical role for immune homeostasis, but may inhibit pathogen-specific immunity in infectious disorders. The present review summarizes the current knowledge about Treg in human CNS infections and their animal models. Besides dampening pathogen-induced immunopathology, Treg have the ability to facilitate protective responses by supporting effector T cell trafficking to the infection site and the development of resident memory T cells. Moreover, Treg can reduce virus replication by inducing apoptosis of infected macrophages and attenuate neurotoxic astrogliosis and pro-inflammatory microglial responses. By contrast, detrimental effects of Treg are caused by suppression of antiviral immunity, allowing for virus persistence and latency. Opposing disease outcomes following Treg manipulation in different models might be attributed to differences in technique and timing of intervention, infection route, genetic background, and the host's age. In addition, mouse models of virus-induced demyelination revealed that Treg are able to reduce autoimmunity and immune-mediated CNS damage in a disease phase-dependent manner. Understanding the unique properties of Treg and their complex interplay with effector cells represents a prerequisite for the development of new therapeutic approaches in neurotropic virus infections.

"Living with relatives can be highly beneficial, enhancing reproduction and survival. High relatedness can, however, increase susceptibility to pathogens. Here, we examine whether the benefits of living with relatives offset the harm caused by pathogens, and if this depends on whether species typically live with kin. Using comparative meta-analysis of plants, animals, and a bacterium (n(species) = 56), we show that high within-group relatedness increases mortality when pathogens are present. In contrast, mortality decreased with relatedness when pathogens were rare, particularly in species that live with kin. Furthermore, across groups variation in mortality was lower when relatedness was high, but abundances of pathogens were more variable. The effects of within-group relatedness were only evident when pathogens were experimentally manipulated, suggesting that the harm caused by pathogens is masked by the benefits of living with relatives in nature. These results highlight the importance of kin selection for understanding disease spread in natural populations.

"Zoonoses, such as plague, are primarily animal diseases that spill over into human populations. While the goal of eradicating such diseases is enticing, historical experience validates abandoning eradication in favor of ecologically based control strategies (which reduce morbidity and mortality to a locally accepted risk level). During the 20th century, one of the most extensive plague-eradication efforts in recorded history was undertaken to enable large-scale changes in land use in the former Soviet Union (including vast areas of central Asia). Despite expending tremendous resources in its attempt to eradicate plague, the Soviet antiplague response gradually abandoned the goal of eradication in favor of plague control linked with developing basic knowledge of plague ecology. Drawing from this experience, we combine new gray-literature sources, historical and recent research, and fieldwork to outline best practices for the control of spillover from zoonoses while minimally disrupting wildlife ecosystems, and we briefly compare the Soviet case with that of endemic plague in the western United States. We argue for the allocation of sufficient resources to maintain ongoing local surveillance, education, and targeted control measures; to incorporate novel technologies selectively; and to use ecological research to inform developing landscape-based models for transmission interruption. We conclude that living with emergent and reemergent zoonotic diseases-switching to control-opens wider possibilities for interrupting spillover while preserving natural ecosystems, encouraging adaptation to local conditions, and using technological tools judiciously and in a cost-effective way.

"BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by various pathogenic microorganisms is ubiquitous in the parts of the urinary system such as kidney, ureter, bladder, and urethra. Currently, clinical detection of UTI is mainly focused on urine culture; however, the diagnostic value of urine culture remains limited due to the time-consuming procedure and low detection rate, especially in patients who have used antibiotics. Generally, treatment for UTI relies on empirical medication rather than pathogen diagnosis, which leads to the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents and a significant increase in resistant strains. Comparatively, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is capable of overcoming the disadvantages of clinical culture, and identifying pathogens for further treatment. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old male patient was admitted to hospital with a high fever and chills. None of his autoimmune disease or thyroid function related indicators were positive, and he had no risk of endocarditis. His white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin 6, and neutrophil proportion were markedly elevated. He was initially diagnosed as having an infection of unknown etiology. Since empirical treatment of Sulperazon and Metronidazole did not relieve his symptoms, both the blood and urine specimens were examined using traditional culture, serological testing, and mNGS assay. Traditional culture and serological testing produced negative results, while the mNGS assay revealed the presence of a potential pathogen, Enterococcus faecalis, in the urine specimen, which was further confirmed by both Sanger sequencing and qPCR analysis. A CT scan of the patient's whole abdomen showed stones in the right kidney. Once targeted antibiotic therapy was administered, the patient recovered quickly. CONCLUSIONS: Our case illustrated that mNGS, as a novel culture-independent approach, demonstrated the capability of rapid, sensitive, and accurate pathogen identification. Furthermore, this technology provides strong support for guiding clinicians to determine appropriate treatment.

"This chapter discusses the anatomy, functions, and biochemistry of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF has four major functions: physical support of neural structures, excretion and “sink” action, intracerebral transport, and control of the chemical environment of the central nervous system. CSF provides a “water jacket” of physical support and buoyancy. The CSF is protective because its volume changes reciprocally with changes in the volume of intracranial contents, particularly blood. Thus, the CSF protects the brain from changes in arterial and central venous pressure associated with posture, respiration, and exertion. Acute or chronic pathological changes in intracranial contents can be accommodated, to a point, by changes in the CSF volume. The direct transfer of brain metabolites into the CSF provides excretory function. This capacity is important because the brain lacks a lymphatic system. The lymphatic function of the CSF is also manifested in the removal of large proteins and cells, such as bacteria or blood cells, by bulk CSF absorption. The “sink” action of the CSF arises from the restricted access of water-soluble substances to the CSF and the low concentration of these solutes in the CSF.

"Nearly 690 raw surface water samples were collected during a 6-year period from multiple watersheds in the South Nation River basin, Ontario, Canada. Cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples were enumerated, sequenced, and genotyped by detailed phylogenetic analysis. The resulting species and genotypes were assigned to broad, known host and human infection risk classes. Wildlife/unknown, livestock, avian, and human host classes occurred in 21, 13, 3, and <1% of sampled surface waters, respectively. Cryptosporidium andersoni was the most commonly detected livestock species, while muskrat I and II genotypes were the most dominant wildlife genotypes. The presence of Giardia spp., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli O157:H7 was evaluated in all water samples. The greatest significant odds ratios (odds of pathogen presence when host class is present/odds of pathogen presence when host class is absent) for Giardia spp., Campylobacter spp., and Salmonella spp. in water were associated, respectively, with livestock (odds ratio of 3.1), avian (4.3), and livestock (9.3) host classes. Classification and regression tree analyses (CART) were used to group generalized host and human infection risk classes on the basis of a broad range of environmental and land use variables while tracking cooccurrence of zoonotic pathogens in these groupings. The occurrence of livestock-associated Cryptosporidium was most strongly related to agricultural water pollution in the fall (conditions also associated with elevated odds ratios of other zoonotic pathogens occurring in water in relation to all sampling conditions), whereas wildlife/unknown sources of Cryptosporidium were geospatially associated with smaller watercourses where urban/rural development was relatively lower. Conditions that support wildlife may not necessarily increase overall human infection risks associated with Cryptosporidium since most Cryptosporidium genotypes classed as wildlife in this study (e.g., muskrat I and II genotype) do not pose significant infection risks to humans. Consequently, from a human health perspective, land use practices in agricultural watersheds that create opportunities for wildlife to flourish should not be rejected solely on the basis of their potential to increase relative proportions of wildlife fecal contamination in surface water. The present study suggests that mitigating livestock fecal pollution in surface water in this region would likely reduce human infection risks associated with Cryptosporidium and other zoonotic pathogens.

"In this 2-part review, I will focus on emerging virus infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Part 1 will introduce the basic features of emerging infections, including their definition, epidemiology, and the frequency of CNS involvement. Important mechanisms of emergence will be reviewed, including viruses spreading into new host ranges as exemplified by West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus, Toscana virus, and enterovirus 71 (EV71). Emerging infections also result from opportunistic spread of viruses into known niches, often resulting from attenuated host resistance to infection. This process is exemplified by transplant-associated cases of viral CNS infection caused by WNV, rabies virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis-like viruses and by the syndrome of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6)-associated posttransplantation acute limbic encephalitis. The second part of this review begins with a discussion of JC virus and the occurrence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in association with novel immunomodulatory therapies and then continues with an overview of the risk of infection introduced by imported animals (eg, monkeypox virus) and examples of emerging diseases caused by enhanced competence of viruses for vectors and the spread of vectors (eg, chikungunya virus) and then concludes with examples of novel viruses causing CNS infection as exemplified by Nipah and Hendra viruses and bat lyssaviruses.

"Many biomedical research studies use captive animals to model human health and disease. However, a surprising number of studies show that the biological systems of animals living in standard laboratory housing are abnormal. To make animal studies more relevant to human health, research animals should live in the wild or be able to roam free in captive environments that offer a natural range of both positive and negative experiences. Recent technological advances now allow us to study freely roaming animals and we should make use of them.

"BACKGROUND: Whether Borna disease virus (BDV-1) is a human pathogen remained controversial until recent encephalitis cases showed BDV-1 infection could even be deadly. This called to mind previous evidence for an infectious contribution of BDV-1 to mental disorders. Pilot open trials suggested that BDV-1 infected depressed patients benefitted from antiviral therapy with a licensed drug (amantadine) which also tested sensitive in vitro. Here, we designed a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) which cross-linked depression and BDV-1 infection, addressing both the antidepressant and antiviral efficacy of amantadine. METHODS: The interventional phase II RCT (two 7-weeks-treatment periods and a 12-months follow-up) at the Hannover Medical School (MHH), Germany, assigned currently depressed BDV-1 infected patients with either major depression (MD; N = 23) or bipolar disorder (BD; N = 13) to amantadine sulphate (PK-Merz®; twice 100 mg orally daily) or placebo treatment, and contrariwise, respectively. Clinical changes were assessed every 2-3 weeks by the 21-item Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAMD) (total, single, and combined scores). BDV-1 activity was determined accordingly in blood plasma by enzyme immune assays for antigens (PAG), antibodies (AB) and circulating immune complexes (CIC). RESULTS: Primary outcomes (≥25% HAMD reduction, week 7) were 81.3% amantadine vs. 35.3% placebo responder (p = 0.003), a large clinical effect size (ES; Cohen's d) of 1.046, and excellent drug tolerance. Amantadine was safe reducing suicidal behaviour in the first 2 weeks. Pre-treatment maximum infection levels were predictive of clinical improvement (AB, p = 0.001; PAG, p = 0.026; HAMD week 7). Respective PAG and CIC levels correlated with AB reduction (p = 0,001 and p = 0.034, respectively). Follow-up benefits (12 months) correlated with dropped cumulative infection measures over time (p < 0.001). In vitro, amantadine concentrations as low as 2.4-10 ng/mL (50% infection-inhibitory dose) prevented infection with human BDV Hu-H1, while closely related memantine failed up to 100,000-fold higher concentration (200 μg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate profound antidepressant efficacy of safe oral amantadine treatment, paralleling antiviral effects at various infection levels. This not only supports the paradigm of a link of BDV-1 infection and depression. It provides a novel possibly practice-changing low cost mental health care perspective for depressed BDV-1-infected patients addressing global needs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was retrospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Registry on 04th of March 2015. The trial ID is DRKS00007649; https://www.drks.de/drks_web/setLocale_EN.do.

"Studies of bird migration in the Beringia region of Alaska and eastern Siberia are of special interest for revealing the importance of bird migration between Eurasia and North America, for evaluating orientation principles used by the birds at polar latitudes and for understanding the evolutionary implications of intercontinental migratory connectivity among birds as well as their parasites. We used tracking radar placed onboard the ice-breaker Oden to register bird migratory flights from 30 July to 19 August 2005 and we encountered extensive bird migration in the whole Beringia range from latitude 64 degrees N in Bering Strait up to latitude 75 degrees N far north of Wrangel Island, with eastward flights making up 79% of all track directions. The results from Beringia were used in combination with radar studies from the Arctic Ocean north of Siberia and in the Beaufort Sea to make a reconstruction of a major Siberian-American bird migration system in a wide Arctic sector between longitudes 110 degrees E and 130 degrees W, spanning one-third of the entire circumpolar circle. This system was estimated to involve more than 2 million birds, mainly shorebirds, terns and skuas, flying across the Arctic Ocean at mean altitudes exceeding 1 km (maximum altitudes 3-5 km). Great circle orientation provided a significantly better fit with observed flight directions at 20 different sites and areas than constant geographical compass orientation. The long flights over the sea spanned 40-80 degrees of longitude, corresponding to distances and durations of 1400-2600 km and 26-48 hours, respectively. The birds continued from this eastward migration system over the Arctic Ocean into several different flyway systems at the American continents and the Pacific Ocean. Minimization of distances between tundra breeding sectors and northerly stopover sites, in combination with the Beringia glacial refugium and colonization history, seemed to be important for the evolution of this major polar bird migration system.

"BACKGROUND: The hypothesis that microbial infections may be linked to mental disorders has long been addressed for Borna disease virus (BDV), but clinical and epidemiological evidence remained inconsistent due to non-conformities in detection methods. BDV circulating immune complexes (CIC) were shown to exceed the prevalence of serum antibodies alone and to comparably screen for infection in Europe (DE, CZ, IT), the Middle East (IR) and Asia (CN), still seeking general acceptance. METHODS: We used CIC and antigen (Ag) tests to investigate BDV infection in Lithuania through a case-control study design comparing in-patients suffering of primary psychosis with blood donors. One hundred and six acutely psychotic in-patients with no physical illness, consecutively admitted to the regional mental hospital, and 98 blood donors from the Blood Donation Centre, Lithuania, were enrolled in the study. The severity of psychosis was assessed twice, prior and after acute antipsychotic therapy, by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). BDV-CIC and Ag markers were tested once after therapy was terminated. RESULTS: What we found was a significantly higher prevalence of CIC, indicating a chronic BDV infection, in patients with treated primary psychosis than in blood donor controls (39.6 % vs. 22.4 %, respectively). Free BDV Ag, indicating currently active infection, did not show significant differences among study groups. Higher severity of psychosis prior to treatment was inversely correlated to the presence of BDV Ag (42.6 vs. 34.1 BPRS, respectively; p = 0.022). CONCLUSIONS: The study concluded significantly higher BDV infection rates in psychotic than in healthy Lithuanians, thus supporting similar global trends for other mental disorders. The study raised awareness to consider the integration of BDV infection surveillance in psychiatry research in the future.

"Human risks of acquiring a zoonotic disease from animals used in biomedical research have declined over the last decade because higher quality research animals have defined microbiologic profiles. Even with diminished risks, the potential for exposure to infectious agents still exists, especially from larger species such as nonhuman primates, which may be obtained from the wild, and from livestock, dogs, ferrets, and cats, which are generally not raised in barrier facilities and are not subject to the intensive health monitoring performed routinely on laboratory rodents and rabbits. Additionally, when laboratory animals are used as models for infectious disease studies, exposure to microbial pathogens presents a threat to human health. Also, with the recognition of emerging diseases, some of which are zoonotic, constant vigilance and surveillance of laboratory animals for zoonotic diseases are still required.

"We previously demonstrated that shotgun metagenomic sequencing can detect bacteria in sonicate fluid, providing a diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI). A limitation of the approach that we used is that data analysis was time-consuming and specialized bioinformatics expertise was required, both of which are barriers to routine clinical use. Fortunately, automated commercial analytic platforms that can interpret shotgun metagenomic data are emerging. In this study, we evaluated the CosmosID bioinformatics platform using shotgun metagenomic sequencing data derived from 408 sonicate fluid samples from our prior study with the goal of evaluating the platform vis-à-vis bacterial detection and antibiotic resistance gene detection for predicting staphylococcal antibacterial susceptibility. Samples were divided into a derivation set and a validation set, each consisting of 204 samples; results from the derivation set were used to establish cutoffs, which were then tested in the validation set for identifying pathogens and predicting staphylococcal antibacterial resistance. Metagenomic analysis detected bacteria in 94.8% (109/115) of sonicate fluid culture-positive PJIs and 37.8% (37/98) of sonicate fluid culture-negative PJIs. Metagenomic analysis showed sensitivities ranging from 65.7 to 85.0% for predicting staphylococcal antibacterial resistance. In conclusion, the CosmosID platform has the potential to provide fast, reliable bacterial detection and identification from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data derived from sonicate fluid for the diagnosis of PJI. Strategies for metagenomic detection of antibiotic resistance genes for predicting staphylococcal antibacterial resistance need further development.

"BACKGROUND: Two populations of Dermacentor reticulatus ticks (Western and Eastern) in Poland are among the most dynamic tick populations in Central Europe. Expansion and settlement of ticks in new localizations depend on the presence of suitable hosts, for both adult and juvenile ticks. METHODS: The current study was planned to complement our previous studies on questing adult ticks and was focused on a collection of juvenile D. reticulatus ticks from rodents from three regions in Poland, defined by the presence/absence of adult ticks (regions of the Western and Eastern tick population and the gap area between them) to confirm the existence of stable populations. Rodent trapping was conducted in open habitats (fallow lands, wasteland and submerged meadows) in 2016-2018 in June, July and/or August to encompass seasonal peaks of larvae and nymph activity. RESULTS: Altogether, three tick species were collected, 2866 D. reticulatus, 2141 Ixodes ricinus and 427 Haemaphysalis concinna. Dermacentor reticulatus was the most common (72.3%) and abundant (mean 17.94 ± 2.62 ticks/rodent) tick species on rodents from the Eastern region; in the Western region infestation of rodents was only 6.8%. Ixodes ricinus was found in all three regions and was the only tick species collected from rodents from the gap area. Haemaphysalis concinna was noted only in the Western region. The highest infestation of juvenile D. reticulatus was recorded on voles (Myodes and Microtus spp.), infestation of I. ricinus was the highest on Apodemus mice, and the majority of H. concinna ticks were collected from root voles Alexandromys oeconomus. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed a stable population of D. reticulatus in Eastern and Central Poland and a lower prevalence and mean abundance of this tick species among rodents from the Western region. A lack of juvenile D. reticulatus on rodents in Niewiadów confirmed the existence of the gap area, free of D. reticulatus ticks.

"An important contributor to the differences between individuals derives from their plasticity. Such plasticity is widespread in organisms from the simple to the most complex. Adaptability plasticity enables the organism to cope with a novel challenge not previously encountered by its ancestors. Conditional plasticity appears to have evolved from repeated challenges from the environment so that the organism responds in a particular manner to the environment in which it finds itself. The resulting phenotypic variation can be triggered during development in a variety of ways, some mediated through the parent's phenotype. Sometimes the organism copes in suboptimal conditions trading off reproductive success against survival. Whatever the adaptedness of the phenotype, each of the many types of plasticity demonstrates how a given genotype will express itself differently in different environmental conditions-a field of biology referred to as the study of epigenetics. The ways in which epigenetic mechanisms may have evolved are discussed, as are the potential impacts on the evolution of their descendants.

"Viruses require a host for replication and survival and hence are subjected to host immunological pressures. The complement system, a crucial first response of the host immune system, is effective in targeting viruses and virus-infected cells, and boosting the antiviral innate and acquired immune responses. Thus, the system imposes a strong selection pressure on viruses. Consequently, viruses have evolved multiple countermeasures against host complement. A major mechanism employed by viruses to subvert the complement system is encoding proteins that target complement. Since viruses have limited genome size, most of these proteins are multifunctional in nature. In this review, we provide up to date information on the structure and complement regulatory functions of various viral proteins.

"Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes pavlovskyi, and Dermacentor reticulatus ticks inhabiting Western Siberia are responsible for the transmission of a number of etiological agents that cause human and animal tick-borne diseases. Because these ticks are abundant in the suburbs of large cities, agricultural areas, and popular tourist sites and frequently attack people and livestock, data regarding the microbiomes of these organisms are required. Using metagenomic 16S profiling, we evaluate bacterial communities associated with I. persulcatus, I. pavlovskyi, and D. reticulatus ticks collected from the Novosibirsk region of Russia. A total of 1214 ticks were used for this study. DNA extracted from the ticks was pooled according to tick species and sex. Sequencing of the V3-V5 domains of 16S rRNA genes was performed using the Illumina Miseq platform. The following bacterial genera were prevalent in the examined communities: Acinetobacter (all three tick species), Rickettsia (I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus) and Francisella (D. reticulatus). B. burgdorferi sensu lato and B. miyamotoi sequences were detected in I. persulcatus and I. pavlovskyi but not in D. reticulatus ticks. The pooled samples of all tick species studied contained bacteria from the Anaplasmataceae family, although their occurrence was low. DNA from A. phagocytophilum and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis was first observed in I. pavlovskyi ticks. Significant inter-species differences in the number of bacterial taxa as well as intra-species diversity related to tick sex were observed. The bacterial communities associated with the I. pavlovskyi ticks displayed a higher biodiversity compared with those of the I. persulcatus and D. reticulatus ticks. Bacterial community structure was also diverse across the studied tick species, as shown by permutational analysis of variance using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity metric (p = 0.002). Between-sex variation was confirmed by PERMANOVA testing in I. persulcatus (p = 0.042) and I. pavlovskyi (p = 0.042) ticks. Our study indicated that 16S metagenomic profiling could be used for rapid assessment of the occurrence of medically important bacteria in tick populations inhabiting different natural biotopes and therefore the epidemic danger of studied foci.

"White-nose syndrome (WNS) caused by the fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) has killed millions of North American hibernating bats. Currently, methods to prevent the disease are limited. We conducted two trials to assess potential WNS vaccine candidates in wild-caught Myotis lucifugus. In a pilot study, we immunized bats with one of four vaccine treatments or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a control and challenged them with Pd upon transfer into hibernation chambers. Bats in one vaccine-treated group, that received raccoon poxviruses (RCN) expressing Pd calnexin (CAL) and serine protease (SP), developed WNS at a lower rate (1/10) than other treatments combined (14/23), although samples sizes were small. The results of a second similar trial provided additional support for this observation. Bats vaccinated orally or by injection with RCN-CAL and RCN-SP survived Pd challenge at a significantly higher rate (P = 0.01) than controls. Using RT-PCR and flow cytometry, combined with fluorescent in situ hybridization, we determined that expression of IFN-γ transcripts and the number of CD4 + T-helper cells transcribing this gene were elevated (P < 0.10) in stimulated lymphocytes from surviving vaccinees (n = 15) compared to controls (n = 3). We conclude that vaccination with virally-vectored Pd antigens induced antifungal immunity that could potentially protect bats against WNS.

"The increasing threat of antimicrobial resistance poses one of the greatest challenges to modern medicine. The collection of all antimicrobial resistance genes carried by various microorganisms in the human body is called the human resistome and represents the source of resistance in pathogens that can eventually cause life-threatening and untreatable infections. A deep understanding of the human resistome and its multilateral interaction with various environments is necessary for developing proper measures that can efficiently reduce the spread of resistance. However, the human resistome and its evolution still remain, for the most part, a mystery to researchers. Metagenomics, particularly in combination with next-generation-sequencing technology, provides a powerful methodological approach for studying the human microbiome as well as the pathogenome, the virolume and especially the resistome. We summarize below current knowledge on how the human resistome is shaped and discuss how metagenomics can be employed to improve our understanding of these complex processes, particularly as regards a rapid translation of new findings into clinical diagnostics, infection control and public health.

"During the last 100 years in many countries of the world, there have been dramatic changes in natural/rural landscapes due to urbanization. Since many wildlife species are unable to adapt to these alterations in their environment, urbanization is commonly responsible for a decline of biodiversity in areas of urban development. In contrast, some wild animal species are attracted to peri-urban and urban habitats due to the availability of an abundant food supply and the presence of structures in which to shelter. Urban foxes and/or raccoons are common sights in many peri-urban and urban areas of Europe where they can reach far higher population densities than in their natural habitats. The same is true for foxes and dingoes in some urban areas of Australia. Unfortunately, some of these highly adaptable species are also hosts for a number of parasites of public health and veterinary importance. Due to the complexity of many parasitic life cycles involving several host species, the interactions between wild animals, domestic animals and humans are not fully understood. The role of potential hosts for transmission of a zoonotic disease in urban or peri-urban areas cannot be extrapolated from data obtained in rural areas. Since more than 75% of human diseases are of zoonotic origin, it is important to understand the dynamics between wildlife, domestic animal species and humans in urbanized areas, and to conduct more focused research on transmission of zoonotic parasites including arthropod vectors under such conditions.

"Fifty years ago, the index case of human babesiosis due to Babesia microti was diagnosed in a summer resident of Nantucket Island. Human babesiosis, once called ""Nantucket fever"" due to its seeming restriction to Nantucket and the terminal moraine islands of southern New England, has emerged across the northeastern United States to commonly infect people wherever Lyme disease is endemic. We review the history of babesiosis on Nantucket, analyze its epidemiology and ecology there, provide summaries of the first case histories, and comment on its future public health burden.

"Despite the eradication of smallpox, orthopoxviruses (OPV) remain public health concerns. Efforts to develop new therapeutics and vaccines for smallpox continue through their evaluation in animal models despite limited understanding of the specific correlates of protective immunity. Recent monkeypox virus challenge studies have established the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) as a model of human systemic OPV infections. In this study, we assess the induction of humoral immunity in humans and prairie dogs receiving Dryvax, Acam2000, or Imvamune vaccine and characterize the proteomic profile of immune recognition using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), neutralization assays, and protein microarrays. We confirm anticipated similarities of antigenic protein targets of smallpox vaccine-induced responses in humans and prairie dogs and identify several differences. Subsequent monkeypox virus intranasal infection of vaccinated prairie dogs resulted in a significant boost in humoral immunity characterized by a shift in reactivity of increased intensity to a broader range of OPV proteins. This work provides evidence of similarities between the vaccine responses in prairie dogs and humans that enhance the value of the prairie dog model system as an OPV vaccination model and offers novel findings that form a framework for examining the humoral immune response induced by systemic orthopoxvirus infection.

"Humans and long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis) interface in several locations in Singapore. We investigated six of these interface zones to assess the level of conflict between the two species. We observed macaque-to-human interactions and distributed questionnaires to residents and visitors of nature reserves. We observed an average of two macaque-to-human interactions per hour at the sites, which included affiliative or submissive behaviors (46.9%), aggression (19.1%), taking food and other items (18.5%) searching bins, cars, and houses (13.4%), and nonaggressive contact (2.1%). Two-thirds of interactions occurred when a human was carrying food or food cues, and one-quarter occurred when a human provoked macaques. Only 8% of interactions occurred without a clear human-triggered context. Our interview showed one-third of respondents experienced nuisance problems from macaques. They had items taken from them (50.5%) and received threats (31.9%). Residents reported more nuisance problems than visitors, and their perceptions toward macaques differed. Residents were more aware of the consequences of food provisioning and that there were regulations against feeding. Residents fed macaques less and held more negative sentiments toward macaques. Nearly half of the interviewed people held neutral attitudes toward macaques and only 26.2% of respondents thought conflict with macaques warranted urgent action. Nearly two-thirds of the respondents supported education programs to ameliorate human-macaque conflict, and less than 15% supported removing or eradicating macaques. 87.6% felt that it is importance to conserve and protect macaques. Our results show that human-macaque conflict exists in Singapore, but that it may not be severe. Human behavior is largely responsible for macaque-to-human interactions, and thus could be lessened with management of human behavior in interface zones (i.e. restrict food carrying and provocation). Moreover, our interviews shows people living in Singapore value macaques, do not wish them entirely removed, prefer education-based solutions, and consider conservation and protection of them important.

"BACKGROUND: Stroke is known to affect both men and women; however, incidence and outcomes differ between them. Therefore, the discovery of novel, sex-specific, blood-based biomarkers for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients has the potential to enhance the understanding of the etiology of this deadly disease in the content of sex. The objective of this study was to identify serum metabolites associated with male and female AIS patients. METHODS: Metabolites were measured with the use of untargeted, reverse-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry quantification from blood specimens collected from AIS patients. Samples were collected from 36 patients comprising each of 18 men and women with matched controls. Metabolic pathway analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to differentiate metabolite profiles for male and female AIS patients from the control, while logistic regression was used to determine differences in metabolites between male and female AIS patients. RESULTS: In female AIS patients, 14 distinct altered metabolic pathways and 49 corresponding metabolites were identified, while 39 metabolites and 5 metabolic pathways were identified in male patients. Metabolites that are predictive of ischemic stroke in female patients were 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-2-arachidonoyl-GPC (P-16:0/20:4) (AUC = 0.914, 0.765-1.000), 1-(1-enyl-palmitoyl)-2-palmitoyl-GPC (P-16:0/16:0) (AUC = 0.840, 0.656-1.000), and 5,6-dihydrouracil (P-16:0/20:2) (AUC = 0.815, 0.601-1.000). Significant metabolites that were predictive of stroke in male patients were 5alpha-androstan-3alpha,17beta-diol disulfate (AUC = 0.951, 0.857-1.000), alpha-hydroxyisocaproate (AUC = 0.938, 0.832-1.000), threonate (AUC = 0.877, 0.716-1.000), and bilirubin (AUC = 0.817, 0.746-1.000). CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the untargeted serum metabolomics platform identified multiple pathways and metabolites associated with male and female AIS patients. Further research is necessary to characterize how these metabolites are associated with the pathophysiology in male and female AIS patients.

"Vertebrates can change their behavior upon detection of visual stimuli according to the outcome their actions produce. Such goal-directed behavior involves evolutionary conserved brain structures like the striatum and optic tectum, which receive ascending visual input from the periphery. In mammals, however, these structures also receive descending visual input from visual cortex (VC), via neurons that give rise to cortico-fugal projections. The function of cortico-fugal neurons in visually guided, goal-directed behavior remains unclear. Here, we address the impact of two populations of cortico-fugal neurons in mouse VC in the learning and performance of a visual detection task. We show that the ablation of striatal projecting neurons reduces learning speed, whereas the ablation of superior colliculus projecting neurons does not impact learning but reduces detection sensitivity. This functional dissociation between distinct cortico-fugal neurons in controlling learning speed and detection sensitivity suggests an adaptive contribution of cortico-fugal pathways even in simple goal-directed behavior.

"Emerging and re-emerging viruses may cause meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalomyelitis, encephalitis, Guillian-Barré-like-syndromes as well as strokes. Most important viruses belong to the family of Adenoviridae, Arbovirus, Arenaviridae, Herpesviridae, Picornaviridae, Paramyxoviridae as well as Togaviridae. Clinical presentation usually consists of a biphasic presentation. Non-specific febrile illnesses may be accompanied by rash, headache, arthralgia and myalgia. Thereafter focal neurological signs may evolve. Diagnostic strategies for the detection of emerging and re-emerging viruses may be difficult due to the short viraemic period. Pitfalls in serology may be due to antibody crossreactivity. Arboviruses are transmitted by arthropods. Aedes mosquitos are one of the vectors for arboviruses like Chikungunya-virus, Dengue-virus, Japanese-Encephalitis-B-virus and West-Nile-virus. Since the last centuries Aedes mosquitos have spread from their naturally habitat in Africa to America as well as Europe. The arboviruses risk profile depend essentially on the occurrence, the activity of the respective vector, this may be the key to fight the disease and its spread. Due to global shifts in the ecological balance but also as a result of more or less successful control measures, some diseases have become rarer, others are more common. The viruses persist in the respective vector months to years; in ticks they may persist for years and in mosquitoes 1 to 4 months. In order to survive bad climatic conditions unscathed, the viruses partially overwinter in arthropods.

"We report the isolation of a novel helicobacter isolated from the caecum of the Siberian hamster (Phodopus sungorus). Sequence analysis showed 97% sequence similarity to Helicobacter ganmani. In addition, we report the co-infection of these Siberian hamsters with a Campylobacter sp. and a second Helicobacter sp. with 99% sequence similarity to Helicobacter sp. flexispira taxon 8 (Helicobacter bilis), a species isolated previously from patients with bacteraemia. Gross necropsy and histopathology did not reveal any overt pathological lesions of the liver and gastrointestinal tract that could be attributed to the Helicobacter or Campylobacter spp. infections. This is the first helicobacter to be identified in the Siberian hamster and the first report of co-infection of Helicobacter spp. and Campylobacter sp. in asymptomatic Siberian hamsters.

"Upon acquiring two unique plasmids (pMT1 and pPCP1) and genome rearrangement during the evolution from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, the plague causative agent Y. pestis is closely related to Y. pseudotuberculosis genetically but became highly virulent. We developed a pentaplex real-time PCR assay that not only detects both Yersinia species but also differentiates Y. pestis strains regarding their plasmid profiles. The five targets used were Y. pestis-specific ypo2088, caf1, and pst located on the chromosome, plasmids pMT1 and pPCP1, respectively; Y. pseudotuberculosis-specific chromosomal gene opgG; and 18S ribosomal RNA gene as an internal control for flea DNA. All targets showed 100% specificity and high sensitivity with limits of detection ranging from 1 fg to 100 fg, with Y. pestis-specific pst as the most sensitive target. Using the assay, Y. pestis strains were differentiated 100% by their known plasmid profiles. Testing Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis-spiked flea DNA showed there is no interference from flea DNA on the amplification of targeted genes. Finally, we applied the assay for testing 102 fleas collected from prairie dog burrows where prairie dog die-off was reported months before flea collection. All flea DNA was amplified by 18S rRNA; no Y. pseudotuberculosis was detected; one flea was positive for all Y. pestis-specific targets, confirming local Y. pestis transmission. Our results indicated the assay is sensitive and specific for the detection and differentiation of Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis. The assay can be used in field investigations for the rapid identification of the plague causative agent.

"Recent advances in sequencing technologies have opened the door for the classification of the human virome. While taxonomic classification can be applied to the viruses identified in such studies, this gives no information as to the type of interaction the virus has with the host. As follow-up studies are performed to address these questions, the description of these virus-host interactions would be greatly enriched by applying a standard set of definitions that typify them. This paper describes a framework with which all members of the human virome can be classified based on principles of ecology. The scaffold not only enables categorization of the human virome, but can also inform research aimed at identifying novel virus-host interactions.

"Global positioning system (GPS) technologies have improved the ability of researchers to monitor wildlife; however, use of these technologies is often limited by monetary costs. Some researchers have begun to use commercially available GPS loggers as a less expensive means of tracking wildlife, but data regarding performance of these devices are limited. We tested a commercially available GPS logger (i-gotU GT-120) by placing loggers at ground control points with locations known to < 30 cm. In a preliminary investigation, we collected locations every 15 minutes for several days to estimate location error (LE) and circular error probable (CEP). Using similar methods, we then investigated the influence of cover on LE, CEP, and fix success rate (FSR) by constructing cover over ground control points. We found mean LE was < 10 m and mean 50% CEP was < 7 m. FSR was not significantly influenced by cover and in all treatments remained near 100%. Cover had a minor but significant effect on LE. Denser cover was associated with higher mean LE, but the difference in LE between the no cover and highest cover treatments was only 2.2 m. Finally, the most commonly used commercially available devices provide a measure of estimated horizontal position error (EHPE) which potentially may be used to filter inaccurate locations. Using data combined from the preliminary and cover investigations, we modeled LE as a function of EHPE and number of satellites. We found support for use of both EHPE and number of satellites in predicting LE; however, use of EHPE to filter inaccurate locations resulted in the loss of many locations with low error in return for only modest improvements in LE. Even without filtering, the accuracy of the logger was likely sufficient for studies which can accept average location errors of approximately 10 m.

"BACKGROUND: The flea Xenopsylla cheopis (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) is a vector of plague. Despite this insect's medical importance, especially in Madagascar where plague is endemic, little is known about the organization of its natural populations. We undertook population genetic analyses (i) to determine the spatial genetic structure of X. cheopis in Madagascar and (ii) to determine the potential risk of plague introduction in the neighboring island of Mayotte. RESULTS: We genotyped 205 fleas from 12 sites using nine microsatellite markers. Madagascan populations of X. cheopis differed, with the mean number of alleles per locus per population ranging from 1.78 to 4.44 and with moderate to high levels of genetic differentiation between populations. Three distinct genetic clusters were identified, with different geographical distributions but with some apparent gene flow between both islands and within Malagasy regions. The approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) used to test the predominant direction of flea dispersal implied a recent population introduction from Mayotte to Madagascar, which was estimated to have occurred between 1993 and 2012. The impact of this flea introduction in terms of plague transmission in Madagascar is unclear, but the low level of flea exchange between the two islands seems to keep Mayotte free of plague for now. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the occurrence of genetic structure among populations of the flea vector of plague, X. cheopis, in Madagascar and suggests that a flea population from Mayotte has been introduced to Madagascar recently. As plague has not been reported in Mayotte, this introduction is unlikely to present a major concern for plague transmission. Nonetheless, evidence of connectivity among flea populations in the two islands indicates a possibility for dispersal by fleas in the opposite direction and thus a risk of plague introduction to Mayotte.

"The worldwide status of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) as a zoonosis remains of great concern. This article reviews the main risk factors for bTB in cattle based on a three-level classification: animal, herd and region/country level. A distinction is also made, whenever possible, between situations in developed and developing countries as the difference of context might have consequences in terms of risk of bTB. Recommendations are suggested to animal health professionals and scientists directly involved in the control and prevention of bTB in cattle. The determination of Millennium Development Goals for bTB is proposed to improve the control/eradication of the disease worldwide.

"In 2017, the order Mononegavirales was expanded by the inclusion of a total of 69 novel species. Five new rhabdovirus genera and one new nyamivirus genus were established to harbor 41 of these species, whereas the remaining new species were assigned to already established genera. Furthermore, non-Latinized binomial species names replaced all paramyxovirus and pneumovirus species names, thereby accomplishing application of binomial species names throughout the entire order. This article presents the updated taxonomy of the order Mononegavirales as now accepted by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).

"The crisis generated by the emergence and pandemic spread of COVID-19 has thrown into the global spotlight the dangers associated with novel diseases, as well as the key role of animals, especially wild animals, as potential sources of pathogens to humans. There is a widespread demand for a new relationship with wild and domestic animals, including suggested bans on hunting, wildlife trade, wet markets or consumption of wild animals. However, such policies risk ignoring essential elements of the problem as well as alienating and increasing hardship for local communities across the world, and might be unachievable at scale. There is thus a need for a more complex package of policy and practical responses. We undertook a solution scan to identify and collate 161 possible options for reducing the risks of further epidemic disease transmission from animals to humans, including potential further SARS-CoV-2 transmission (original or variants). We include all categories of animals in our responses (i.e. wildlife, captive, unmanaged/feral and domestic livestock and pets) and focus on pathogens (especially viruses) that, once transmitted from animals to humans, could acquire epidemic potential through high rates of human-to-human transmission. This excludes measures to prevent well-known zoonotic diseases, such as rabies, that cannot readily transmit between humans. We focused solutions on societal measures, excluding the development of vaccines and other preventive therapeutic medicine and veterinary medicine options that are discussed elsewhere. We derived our solutions through reading the scientific literature, NGO position papers, and industry guidelines, collating our own experiences, and consulting experts in different fields. Herein, we review the major zoonotic transmission pathways and present an extensive list of options. The potential solutions are organised according to the key stages of the trade chain and encompass solutions that can be applied at the local, regional and international scales. This is a set of options targeted at practitioners and policy makers to encourage careful examination of possible courses of action, validating their impact and documenting outcomes.

"Rumours associated with wildlife are frequent, although they have received little attention in the scientific literature. Studying rumours is important because of their relevance not only in a broad theoretical sense but also in environmental management. The goal of this study is to explore the complexity of the relationships between humans and wildlife through a thematic analysis of rumours associated with allegedly introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that cause crop damage in Spain. For this purpose, potential rumours were identified using the Google search engine. Data analysis consisted of reading and re-reading Web-based texts to identify main themes, ideas and topics with the assistance of NVivo 10 software. The analysis identified three main themes: (1) the reviewed websites referred to allegedly introduced rabbits which differed from native rabbits; (2) differences were based on alleged observations of unnatural behaviour, physiology or physical appearance of introduced rabbits; (3) rumours were frequently used in the context of the rabbit management conflict; e.g. farmers accused hunters of releasing harmful rabbits. This study suggests that the analysis of wildlife-release rumours sheds light on the position of parties involved in conflicts associated with the (alleged) introduction of wildlife species. It stresses the importance of rumours in conservation and environmental management, and opens the door to future research.

"As they grow, tumors fundamentally alter their microenvironment, disrupting the homeostasis of the host organ and eventually the patient as a whole. Lethality is the ultimate result of deregulated cell signaling and regulatory mechanisms as well as inappropriate host cell recruitment and activity that lead to the death of the patient. These processes have striking parallels to the framework of ecological biology: multiple interacting ecosystems (organ systems) within a larger biosphere (body), alterations in species stoichiometry (host cell types), resource cycling (cellular metabolism and cell-cell signaling), and ecosystem collapse (organ failure and death). In particular, as cancer cells generate their own niche within the tumor ecosystem, ecological engineering and autoeutrophication displace normal cell function and result in the creation of a hypoxic, acidic, and nutrient-poor environment. This ""cancer swamp"" has genetic and epigenetic effects at the local ecosystem level to promote metastasis and at the systemic host level to induce cytokine-mediated lethal syndromes, a major cause of death of cancer patients.

"Social interactions are essential for animals to reproduce, defend their territory, and raise their young. The conserved nature of social behaviors across animal species suggests that the neural pathways underlying the motivation for, and the execution of, specific social responses are also maintained. Modern tools of neuroscience have offered new opportunities for dissecting the molecular and neural mechanisms controlling specific social responses. We will review here recent insights into the neural circuits underlying a particularly fascinating and important form of social interaction, that of parental care. We will discuss how these findings open new avenues to deconstruct infant-directed behavioral control in males and females, and to help understand the neural basis of parenting in a variety of animal species, including humans.

"Wildlife reservoirs of Mycobacterium bovis represent serious obstacles to the eradication of tuberculosis from livestock, particularly cattle. In Michigan, USA tuberculous white-tailed deer transmit M. bovis to other deer and cattle. One approach in dealing with this wildlife reservoir is to vaccinate deer, thus interfering with the intraspecies and interspecies transmission cycles. Thirty-three white-tailed deer were assigned to one of two groups; oral vaccination with 1 × 10(8) colony-forming units of M. bovis BCG Danish (n = 17); and non-vaccinated (n = 16). One hundred eleven days after vaccination deer were infected intratonsilarly with 300 colony-forming units of virulent M. bovis. At examination, 150 days after challenge, BCG vaccinated deer had fewer gross and microscopic lesions, fewer tissues from which M. bovis could be isolated, and fewer late stage granulomas with extensive liquefactive necrosis. Fewer lesions, especially those of a highly necrotic nature should decrease the potential for dissemination of M. bovis within the host and transmission to other susceptible hosts.

"BACKGROUND: Selenium (Se) is an essential element for mammals and its deficiency in the diet is a global problem. Plants accumulate Se and thus represent a major source of Se to consumers. Agronomic biofortification intends to enrich crops with Se in order to secure its adequate supply by people. SCOPE: The goal of this review is to report the present knowledge of the distribution and processes of Se in soil and at the plant-soil interface, and of Se behaviour inside the plant in terms of biofortification. It aims to unravel the Se metabolic pathways that affect the nutritional value of edible plant products, various Se biofortification strategies in challenging environments, as well as the impact of Se-enriched food on human health. CONCLUSIONS: Agronomic biofortification and breeding are prevalent strategies for battling Se deficiency. Future research addresses nanosized Se biofortification, crop enrichment with multiple micronutrients, microbial-integrated agronomic biofortification, and optimization of Se biofortification in adverse conditions. Biofortified food of superior nutritional quality may be created, enriched with healthy Se-compounds, as well as several other valuable phytochemicals. Whether such a food source might be used as nutritional intervention for recently emerged coronavirus infections is a relevant question that deserves investigation.

"Surface waters from paired agricultural watersheds under controlled tile drainage (CTD) and uncontrolled tile drainage (UCTD) were monitored over 7 years in order to determine if there was an effect of CTD (imposed during the growing season) on occurrences and loadings of bacterial and viral pathogens, coliphages, and microbial source tracking markers. There were significantly lower occurrences of human, ruminant, and livestock (ruminant plus pig) Bacteroidales markers in the CTD watershed in relation to the UCTD watershed. As for pathogens, there were significantly lower occurrences of Salmonella spp. and Arcobacter spp. in the CTD watershed. There were no instances where there were significantly higher quantitative loadings of any microbial target in the CTD watershed, except for F-specific DNA (F-DNA) and F-RNA coliphages, perhaps as a result of fecal inputs from a hobby farm independent of the drainage practice treatments. There was lower loading of the ruminant marker in the CTD watershed in relation to the UCTD system, and results were significant at the level P = 0.06. The odds of Salmonella spp. occurring increased when a ruminant marker was present relative to when the ruminant marker was absent, yet for Arcobacter spp., the odds of this pathogen occurring significantly decreased when a ruminant marker was present relative to when the ruminant marker was absent (but increased when a wildlife marker was present relative to when the wildlife marker was absent). Interestingly, the odds of norovirus GII (associated with human and swine) occurring in water increased significantly when a ruminant marker was present relative to when a ruminant marker was absent. Overall, this study suggests that fecal pollution from tile-drained fields to stream could be reduced by CTD utilization.

"An RNA virus-based episomal vector (REVec) whose backbone is Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) can provide long-term gene expression in transduced cells. To improve the transduction efficiency of REVec, we evaluated the role of the viral envelope glycoprotein (G) of the genus Orthobornavirus, including that of BoDV-1, in the production of infectious particles. By using G-pseudotype assay in which the lack of G in G-deficient REVec (ΔG-REVec) was compensated for expression of G, we found that excess expression of BoDV-1-G does not affect particle production itself but results in uncleaved and aberrant mature G expression in the cells, leading to the production of REVec particles with low transduction titers. We revealed that the expression of uncleaved G in the cells inhibits the incorporation of mature G and vgRNA into the particles. This feature of G was conserved among mammalian and avian orthobornaviruses; however, the cleavage efficacy of canary bornavirus 1 (CnBV-1)-G was exceptionally not impaired by its excess expression, which led to the production of the pseudotype ΔG-REVec with the highest titer. Chimeric G proteins between CnBV-1 and -2 revealed that the signal peptide of CnBV-1-G was responsible for the cleavage efficacy through the interaction with intracellular furin. We showed that CnBV-1 G leads to the development of pseudotyped REVec with high transduction efficiency and a high-titer recombinant REVec. Our study demonstrated that the restricted expression of orthobornavirus G contributes to the regulation of infectious particle production, the mechanism of which can improve the transduction efficiency of REVec.IMPORTANCE Most viruses causing persistent infection produce few infectious particles from the infected cells. Borna disease virus 1, a member of the genus Orthobornavirus, is an RNA virus that persistently infects the nucleus and has been applied to vectors for long-term gene expression. In this study, we showed that, common among orthobornaviruses, excessive G expression does not affect particle production itself but reduces the production of infectious particles with mature G and genomic RNA. This result suggested that limited G expression contributes to suppressing abnormal viral particle production. On the other hand, we found that canary bornavirus 1 has an exceptional G maturation mechanism and produces a high-titer virus. Our study will contribute to not only understanding the mechanism of infectious particle production but also improving the vector system of orthobornaviruses.

"Understanding the driving forces that control vole population dynamics requires identifying bacterial parasites hosted by the voles and describing their dynamics at the community level. To this end, we used high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify bacterial parasites in cyclic populations of montane water voles that exhibited a population outbreak and decline in 2014-2018. An unexpectedly large number of 155 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) representing at least 13 genera in 11 families was detected. Individual bacterial richness was higher during declines, and vole body condition was lower. Richness as estimated by Chao2 at the local population scale did not exhibit clear seasonal or cycle phase-related patterns, but at the vole meta-population scale, exhibited seasonal and phase-related patterns. Moreover, bacterial OTUs that were detected in the low density phase were geographically widespread and detected earlier in the outbreak; some were associated with each other. Our results demonstrate the complexity of bacterial community patterns with regard to host density variations, and indicate that investigations about how parasites interact with host populations must be conducted at several temporal and spatial scales: multiple times per year over multiple years, and at both local and long-distance dispersal scales for the host(s) under consideration.

"Parasites, and the diseases they cause, are important from an ecological and evolutionary perspective because they can negatively affect host fitness and can regulate host populations. Consequently, conservation biology has long recognized the vital role that parasites can play in the process of species endangerment and recovery. However, we are only beginning to understand how deeply parasites are embedded in ecological systems, and there is a growing recognition of the important ways in which parasites affect ecosystem structure and function. Thus, there is an urgent need to revisit how parasites are viewed from a conservation perspective and broaden the role that disease ecology plays in conservation-related research and outcomes. This review broadly focusses on the role that disease ecology can play in biological conservation. Our review specifically emphasizes on how the integration of tools and analytical approaches associated with both disease and molecular ecology can be leveraged to aid conservation biology. Our review first concentrates on disease mediated extinctions and wildlife epidemics. We then focus on elucidating how host-parasite interactions has improved our understanding of the eco-evolutionary dynamics affecting hosts at the individual, population, community and ecosystem scales. We believe that the role of parasites as drivers and indicators of ecosystem health is especially an exciting area of research that has the potential to fundamentally alter our view of parasites and their role in biological conservation. The review concludes with a broad overview of the current and potential applications of modern genomic tools in disease ecology to aid biological conservation.

"Bovine tuberculosis (Tb) caused by Mycobacterium bovis has proved refractory to eradication from domestic livestock in countries with wildlife disease reservoirs. Vaccination of wild hosts offers a way of controlling Tb in livestock without wildlife culling. This study was conducted in a Tb-endemic region of New Zealand, where the introduced Australian brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) is the main wildlife reservoir of Tb. Possums were trapped and vaccinated using a prototype oral-delivery system to deliver the Tb vaccine bacille Calmette-Guerin. Vaccinated and control possums were matched according to age, sex and location, re-trapped bimonthly and assessed for Tb status by palpation and lesion aspiration; the site was depopulated after 2 years and post-mortem examinations were conducted to further identify clinical Tb cases and subclinical infection. Significantly fewer culture-confirmed Tb cases were recorded in vaccinated possums (1/51) compared with control animals (12/71); the transition probability from susceptible to infected was significantly reduced in both males and females by vaccination. Vaccine efficacy was estimated at 95 per cent (87-100%) for females and 96 per cent (82-99%) for males. Hence, this trial demonstrates that orally delivered live bacterial vaccines can significantly protect wildlife against natural disease exposure, indicating that wildlife vaccination, along with existing control methods, could be used to eradicate Tb from domestic animals.

"Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting ~476,000 people annually. Borrelia spp. spirochetal bacteria are the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans and are transmitted by Ixodes spp ticks. Clinical manifestations vary depending on which Borrelia genospecies infects the patient and may be a consequence of distinct organotropism between species. In the US, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most commonly reported genospecies and infection can manifest as mild to severe symptoms. Different genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto may be responsible for causing varying degrees of clinical manifestations. While the majority of Lyme borreliae-infected patients fully recover with antibiotic treatment, approximately 15% of infected individuals experience long-term neurological and psychological symptoms that are unresponsive to antibiotics. Currently, long-term antibiotic treatment remains the only FDA-approved option for those suffering from these chronic effects. Here, we discuss the current knowledge pertaining to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the central nervous system (CNS), termed Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), within North America and specifically the United States. We explore the molecular mechanisms of spirochete entry into the brain and the role B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes play in CNS infectivity. Understanding infectivity can provide therapeutic targets for LNB treatment and offer public health understanding of the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes that cause long-lasting symptoms.

"Healthcare-associated transmission of monkeypox has been observed on multiple occasions in areas where the disease is endemic. Data collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from an ongoing CDC-supported program of enhanced surveillance in the Tshuapa Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the annual incidence of human monkeypox is estimated to be 3.5-5/10,000, suggests that there is approximately one healthcare worker infection for every 100 confirmed monkeypox cases. Herein, we describe a study that commenced in February 2017, the intent of which is to evaluate the effectiveness, immunogenicity, and safety of a third-generation smallpox vaccine, IMVAMUNE(®), in healthcare personnel at risk of monkeypox virus (MPXV) infection. We describe procedures for documenting exposures to monkeypox virus infection in study participants, and outline lessons learned that may be of relevance for studies of other investigational medical countermeasures in hard to reach, under-resourced populations.

"Demodex musculi is a prostigmatid follicular mite that has rarely been reported in laboratory mice. Although prevalence of this species has not been assessed formally, we have found that many imported mouse strains from noncommercial sources harbor Demodex mites. To assess whether an acaricide can be used to eradicate this mite, infested immunocompromised mice were provided ivermectin-compounded (12 ppm) feed without restriction for 8 wk (n = 10), were treated topically with moxidectin and imidacloprid (MI; 3 and 13 mg/kg, respectively) weekly for 8 wk (n = 10), or remained untreated (n = 10). Mice were confirmed to be mite-infested before treatment and were tested after treatment by using fur plucks (FP), deep skin scrapes (DSS), and PCR analysis of fur swabs. In addition, the presence of mites was confirmed through skin biopsies at 2 study endpoints (1 wk [n = 5] and 12 wk [ n = 5] after treatment). Samples collected before treatment and from untreated mice were positive for D. musculi at all time points and by all test modalities. After treatment, all ivermectin-treated animals remained infested, whereas mice treated with MI were repeatedly negative by all test modalities. An additional shortened treatment trial revealed that 4 wk of MI (n = 7) was insufficient to eradicate mites. Neither treatment produced any evidence of adverse effects according to hematology, serum chemistry parameters, behavior, body weight, and histopathology. Of the 70 PCR assays performed in treated mice, 14 were positive when FP+DSS was negative. In 6 cases where PCR results were negative, 5 were positive by FP+DSS and a single sample was positive on skin biopsy. Although PCR analysis has a high detection rate for D. musculi, FP+DSS can further enhance the detection rate. In conclusion, topical MI administered for 8 consecutive weeks can safely eradicate D. musculi from an immunocompromised mouse strain.

"The lemurs of Madagascar are threatened by human activities. We present the first molecular detection of canine heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) in a wild non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus rufus). Zoonotic D. immitis infection has been associated with clinical pathology that includes serious and often fatal cardiac and pulmonary reactions. With human encroachment and associated increases in free-roaming dog populations in Madagascar, we examined lemurs for zoonotic canid pathogens. D. immitis presents a new potential conservation threat to lemurs. We highlight the need for wide-ranging and effective interventions, particularly near protected areas, to address this growing conservation issue.

"Macroecological approaches can provide valuable insight into the epidemiology of globally distributed, multi-host pathogens. Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan that infects any warm-blooded animal, including humans, in almost every ecosystem worldwide. There is substantial geographical variation in T. gondii prevalence in wildlife populations and the mechanisms driving this variation are poorly understood. We implemented Bayesian phylogenetic mixed models to determine the association between species' ecology, phylogeny and climatic and anthropogenic factors on T. gondii prevalence. Toxoplasma gondii prevalence data were compiled for free-ranging wild mammal species from 202 published studies, encompassing 45 079 individuals from 54 taxonomic families and 238 species. We found that T. gondii prevalence was positively associated with human population density and warmer temperatures at the sampling location. Terrestrial species had a lower overall prevalence, but there were no consistent patterns between trophic level and prevalence. The relationship between human density and T. gondii prevalence is probably mediated by higher domestic cat abundance and landscape degradation leading to increased environmental oocyst contamination. Landscape restoration and limiting free-roaming in domestic cats could synergistically increase the resiliency of wildlife populations and reduce wildlife and human infection risks from one of the world's most common parasitic infections.

"Environmental changes have an undoubted influence on the appearance, distribution, and evolution of infectious diseases, and notably on those transmitted by vectors. Global change refers to environmental changes arising from human activities affecting the fundamental mechanisms operating in the biosphere. This paper discusses the changes observed in recent times with regard to some important arboviral (arthropod-borne viral) diseases of animals, and the role global change could have played in these variations. Two of the most important arboviral diseases of animals, bluetongue (BT) and West Nile fever/encephalitis (WNF), have been selected as models. In both cases, in the last 15 years an important leap forward has been observed, which has lead to considering them emerging diseases in different parts of the world. BT, affecting domestic ruminants, has recently afflicted livestock in Europe in an unprecedented epizootic, causing enormous economic losses. WNF affects wildlife (birds), domestic animals (equines), and humans, thus, beyond the economic consequences of its occurrence, as a zoonotic disease, it poses an important public health threat. West Nile virus (WNV) has expanded in the last 12 years worldwide, and particularly in the Americas, where it first occurred in 1999, extending throughout the Americas relentlessly since then, causing a severe epidemic of disastrous consequences for public health, wildlife, and livestock. In Europe, WNV is known long time ago, but it is since the last years of the twentieth century that its incidence has risen substantially. Circumstances such as global warming, changes in land use and water management, increase in travel, trade of animals, and others, can have an important influence in the observed changes in both diseases. The following question is raised: What is the contribution of global changes to the current increase of these diseases in the world?

"Complement factor D (Df) is a serine protease well known for activating the alternative pathway (AP) in mammals by promoting the cleavage of complement component 3 (C3), thus becoming involved in innate defense. In teleost fish, however, the functional mechanisms of Df in the AP and against pathogen infection are far from clear. In the present study, we cloned and characterized the Df gene, CiDf, from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and analyzed its function in promoting C3 cleavage and expression changes after grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection. The open reading frame of CiDf was found to be 753 bp, encoding 250 amino acids with a molecular mass of 27.06 kDa. CiDf harbors a conserved Tryp_SPc domain, with three conserved residues representing the catalytic triad and three conserved binding sites in the substrate specificity pocket. Pairwise alignment showed that CiDf shares the highest identity (96%) and similarity (98%) with Df from Anabarilius grahami. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CiDf and other fish Dfs formed a distinct evolutionary branch. Similar to most Dfs from other vertebrates, the CiDf gene structure is characterized by four introns and five exons. The incubation of recombinant CiDf protein with grass carp serum significantly increased the C3b content, demonstrating the conserved function of CiDf in the AP in promoting C3 cleavage, similar to Dfs in mammals. CiDf mRNA expression was widely detected in various tissues and levels were relatively higher in the liver, spleen, and intestine of grass carp. During GCRV infection over a 168-hour period, a high level of CiDf mRNA expression in the liver, spleen, and intestine was maintained at 144 and 168 h, suggesting AP activity at the late stage of GCRV infection. Collectively, the above results reveal the conserved structure and function of CiDf and its distinct expression patterns after GCRV infection, which provide a key basis for studying the roles of Df and AP during GCRV infection in the grass carp C. idella.

"Population cycles are one of nature's great mysteries. For almost a hundred years, innumerable studies have probed the causes of cyclic dynamics in snowshoe hares, voles and lemmings, forest Lepidoptera and grouse. Even though cyclic species have very different life histories, similarities in mechanisms related to their dynamics are apparent. In addition to high reproductive rates and density-related mortality from predators, pathogens or parasitoids, other characteristics include transgenerational reduced reproduction and dispersal with increasing-peak densities, and genetic similarity among populations. Experiments to stop cyclic dynamics and comparisons of cyclic and noncyclic populations provide some understanding but both reproduction and mortality must be considered. What determines variation in amplitude and periodicity of population outbreaks remains a mystery.

"Since the recognition that louping-ill, known for well over 100 years as an epizootic disease of sheep in Scotland, was caused by a virus transmitted by arthropods, many other arthropod-borne viruses capable of causing encephalitis in domestic animals or man have been discovered. The author reviews here the knowledge at present available on these viruses, originally termed ""arthropod-borne encephalitides viruses"" but now often referred to as ""arbor viruses"".In this discussion of the host and vector relationships of the two broad groups of arbor viruses - the mosquito-borne and the tick-borne-and of the distribution, epidemiology and control of the various diseases they cause, the author includes an outline of the types of investigation likely to provide the most useful information, stressing in this connexion the value of ecological surveys.

"There is no place on Earth like the Galapagos Islands and no better destination to discuss the reality of evolution. Under the theme 'Why Does Evolution Matter', the University San Francisco of Quito (USFQ), Ecuador, and its Galapagos Institute for the Arts and Sciences (GAIAS), organized the III World Evolution Summit in San Cristóbal Island. The 200-attendee meeting took place on 1 to 5 June 2013; it included 12 keynote speakers, 20 oral presentations by international scholars, and 31 posters by faculty, postdocs, and graduate and undergraduate students. The Summit encompassed five sessions: evolution and society, pre-cellular evolution and the RNA world, behavior and environment, genome, and microbes and diseases. USFQ and GAIAS launched officially the Lynn Margulis Center for Evolutionary Biology and showcased the Galapagos Science Center, in San Cristóbal, an impressive research facility conceptualized in partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, USA. USFQ and GAIAS excelled at managing the conference with exceptional vision and at highlighting the relevance of Galapagos in the history of modern evolutionary thinking; Charles Darwin's visit to this volcanic archipelago in 1835 unfolded unprecedented scientific interest in what today is a matchless World Heritage.

"Behaviors that cause the death of an actor are typically strongly disfavored by natural selection, and yet many bacteria undergo cell lysis to release anti-competitor toxins [1-5]. This behavior is most easily explained if only a small proportion of cells die to release toxins and help their clonemates, but the frequency of cells that actually lyse during bacterial warfare is unknown. The challenge is finding a way to distinguish cells that have undergone programmed suicide from those that were simply killed by a competitor's toxin. We developed a two-color fluorescence reporter assay in Escherichia coli to overcome this problem. This revealed conditions where nearly all cells undergo programmed lysis. Specifically, adding a DNA-damaging toxin (DNase colicin) from another strain induced mass cell suicide where ∼85% of cells lysed to release their own toxins. Time-lapse 3D confocal microscopy showed that self-lysis occurs locally at even higher frequencies (∼94%) at the interface between toxin-producing colonies. By exposing E. coli that do not perform lysis to the DNase colicin, we found that mass lysis occurs when cells are going to die anyway from toxin exposure. From an evolutionary perspective, this renders the behavior cost-free as these cells have zero reproductive potential. This helps to explain how mass cell suicide can evolve, as any small benefit to surviving clonemates can lead to this retaliatory strategy being favored by natural selection. Our findings have parallels to the suicidal attacks of social insects [6-9], which are also performed by individuals with low reproductive potential.

"The idea that dorsal thalamic inputs can be divided into ""drivers"", which provide the primary excitatory drive for the relay of information to cortex, and ""modulators"", which alter the gain of signal transmission, has provided a valuable organizing principle for the study of thalamic function. This view further promoted the identification of ""first order"" and ""higher order"" thalamic nuclei, based on the origin of their driving inputs. Since the introduction of this influential terminology, a number of studies have revealed the existence of a wide variety of thalamic organizational schemes. For example, some thalamic nuclei are not innervated by typical driver inputs, but instead receive input from terminals which exhibit features distinct from those of either classic drivers or modulators. In addition, many thalamic nuclei contain unique combinations of convergent first order, higher order, and/or other ""driver-like"" inputs that do not conform with the driver/modulator framework. The assortment of synaptic arrangements identified in the thalamus are reviewed and discussed from the perspective that this organizational diversity can dramatically increase the computational capabilities of the thalamus, reflecting its essential roles in sensory, motor, and sensory-motor circuits.

"BACKGROUND: The detection of pathogens in clinical and environmental samples using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is often hampered by large amounts of background information, which is especially true for viruses with small genomes. Enormous sequencing depth can be necessary to compile sufficient information for identification of a certain pathogen. Generic HTS combining with in-solution capture enrichment can markedly increase the sensitivity for virus detection in complex diagnostic samples. METHODS: A virus panel based on the principle of biotinylated RNA baits was developed for specific capture enrichment of epizootic and zoonotic viruses (VirBaits). The VirBaits set was supplemented by a SARS-CoV-2 predesigned bait set for testing recent SARS-CoV-2-positive samples. Libraries generated from complex samples were sequenced via generic HTS (without enrichment) and afterwards enriched with the VirBaits set. For validation, an internal proficiency test for emerging epizootic and zoonotic viruses (African swine fever virus, Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, Nipah henipavirus, Rift Valley fever virus) was conducted. RESULTS: The VirBaits set consists of 177,471 RNA baits (80-mer) based on about 18,800 complete viral genomes targeting 35 epizootic and zoonotic viruses. In all tested samples, viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes were clearly enriched ranging from about 10-fold to 10,000-fold for viruses including distantly related viruses with at least 72% overall identity to viruses represented in the bait set. Viruses showing a lower overall identity (38% and 46%) to them were not enriched but could nonetheless be detected based on capturing conserved genome regions. The internal proficiency test supports the improved virus detection using the combination of HTS plus targeted enrichment but also points to the risk of cross-contamination between samples. CONCLUSIONS: The VirBaits approach showed a high diagnostic performance, also for distantly related viruses. The bait set is modular and expandable according to the favored diagnostics, health sector, or research question. The risk of cross-contamination needs to be taken into consideration. The application of the RNA-baits principle turned out to be user friendly, and even non-experts can easily use the VirBaits workflow. The rapid extension of the established VirBaits set adapted to actual outbreak events is possible as shown for SARS-CoV-2. Video abstract.

"The purpose of this study was to determine a wide range of selected hematologic, venous blood gases, and plasma biochemistry analytes in common chameleons (Chamaeleo chamaeleon). Blood samples were collected from the ventral tail vein of 41 common chameleons to determine reference intervals for 30 different blood analytes. The calcium-to-phosphorus ratio, packed cell volume (PCV), refractometric total solids (TS), blood cell counts, and differentials were also determined. The microscopic evaluation of blood smears revealed inclusion bodies in monocytes in 7 of the samples. Females showed significantly higher values of plasma proteins and calcium and cholesterol concentrations and males showed significantly higher values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) plasma concentrations. Significant differences were found between similar analytes determined by different testing methodologies in the PCV/hematocrit, electrolytes (sodium, potassium), and plasma proteins [TS, total protein (TP) and albumin]. Blood analytes determined in this study can provide baseline data that may be useful when evaluating the health status of common chameleons, taking into consideration the potential effects of gender and the type of analyzer used.

"Rivers are often challenged by fecal contaminations. The barrier effect of sediments against fecal bacteria was investigated through the use of a microbial source tracking (MST) toolbox, and by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of V5-V6 16S rRNA gene (rrs) sequences. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling analysis of V5-V6 16S rRNA gene sequences differentiated bacteriomes according to their compartment of origin i.e., surface water against benthic and hyporheic sediments. Classification of these reads showed the most prevalent operating taxonomic units (OTU) to be allocated to Flavobacterium and Aquabacterium. Relative numbers of Gaiella, Haliangium, and Thermoleophilum OTU matched the observed differentiation of bacteriomes according to river compartments. OTU patterns were found impacted by combined sewer overflows (CSO) through an observed increase in diversity from the sewer to the hyporheic sediments. These changes appeared driven by direct transfers of bacterial contaminants from wastewaters but also by organic inputs favoring previously undetectable bacterial groups among sediments. These NGS datasets appeared more sensitive at tracking community changes than MST markers. The human-specific MST marker HF183 was strictly detected among CSO-impacted surface waters and not river bed sediments. The ruminant-specific DNA marker was more broadly distributed but intense bovine pollution was required to detect transfers from surface water to benthic and hyporheic sediments. Some OTU showed distribution patterns in line with these MST datasets such as those allocated to the Aeromonas, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas. Fecal indicators (Escherichia coli and total thermotolerant coliforms) were detected all over the river course but their concentrations were not correlated with MST ones. Overall, MST and NGS datasets suggested a poor colonization of river sediments by bovine and sewer bacterial contaminants. No environmental outbreak of these bacterial contaminants was detected.

"A total of 460 kidney samples from wildlife (beavers, coyotes, deer, foxes, opossums, otters, raccoons, skunks) were obtained from road-kill and hunter/trapper donations in Ontario between January 2010 and November 2012. The objectives of the study were to detect Leptospira spp. by immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to map presence of leptospires in wildlife relative to livestock and human populations, and to characterize positive samples by sequencing and comparison to leptospires known to affect domestic animals and humans. The proportion of samples that tested positive ranged from 0% to 42%, with the highest rates in skunks and raccoons. Leptospira spp. were present in kidneys of wildlife across Ontario, particularly in areas of high human density, and areas in which livestock populations are abundant. The PCR was too weak in most samples to permit genotyping and examination of the relationship between the leptospires found in this study and those affecting domestic animals and humans.

"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) likely has evolutionary origins in other animals than humans based on genetically related viruses existing in rhinolophid bats and pangolins. Similar to other animal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 contains a functional furin cleavage site in its spike protein, which may broaden the SARS-CoV-2 host range and affect pathogenesis. Whether ongoing zoonotic infections are possible in addition to efficient human-to-human transmission remains unclear. In contrast, human-to-animal transmission can occur based on evidence provided from natural and experimental settings. Carnivores, including domestic cats, ferrets and minks, appear to be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in contrast to poultry and other animals reared as livestock such as cattle and swine. Epidemiologic evidence supported by genomic sequencing corroborated mink-to-human transmission events in farm settings. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between experimentally infected cats additionally substantiates the possibility of cat-to-human transmission. To evaluate the COVID-19 risk represented by domestic and farmed carnivores, experimental assessments should include surveillance and health assessment of domestic and farmed carnivores, characterization of the immune interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and carnivore coronaviruses, determination of the SARS-CoV-2 host range beyond carnivores and identification of human risk groups such as veterinarians and farm workers. Strategies to mitigate the risk of zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 infections may have to be developed in a One Health framework and non-pharmaceutical interventions may have to consider free-roaming animals and the animal farming industry.

"CREB-binding protein (p300/CBP) is a universal transcriptional co-regulator with lysine acetyltransferase activity. Drosophila melanogaster p300/CBP is a well-known regulator of embryogenesis, and recent studies in beetles and cockroaches have revealed the importance of this protein during post-embryonic development and endocrine signaling. In pest insects, p300/CBP may therefore offer a useful target for control methods based on RNA interference (RNAi). We investigated the role of p300/CBP in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), a notorious pest insect used as a laboratory model for the analysis of complex life-history traits. The RNAi-based attenuation of A. pisum p300/CBP significantly reduced the aphid lifespan and number of offspring, as well as shortening the reproductive phase, suggesting the manipulation of this gene contributes to accelerated senescence. Furthermore, injection of p300/CBP dsRNA also reduced the number of viable offspring and increased the number of premature nymphs, which developed in abnormally structured ovaries. Our data confirm the evolutionarily conserved function of p300/CBP during insect embryogenesis and show that the protein has a critical effect on longevity, reproduction and development in A. pisum. The potent effect of p300/CBP silencing indicates that this regulatory protein is an ideal target for RNAi-based aphid control.

"Buprenorphine is a frequently used analgetic agent in veterinary medicine. A major drawback, however, is the short duration of action requiring several daily administrations. We therefore designed a poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) based microparticulate drug formulation for sustained parenteral drug release. Particles were designed to allow for a fast onset of action and a duration of the analgesic effect of at least two days in laboratory mice. Microparticles were produced using a solvent evaporation technique. Release rate was dependent on polymer type and particle size. Spherical particles used for subsequent animal studies had a mean size of 50 µm and contained 4.5% of buprenorphine. Drug release was characterized by an initial burst release of 30% followed by complete release over seven days. In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments in female C57BL/6 J mice confirmed prolonged exposure in plasma and brain tissue and correlated with the pharmacological effect in the hot plate assay or after minor abdominal surgery. No adverse side effects with respect to food and water intake, body weight, local tolerability, or nesting behavior were observed. Our formulation is an attractive alternative to established immediate release formulations. A use for prolonged pain management in laboratory animals is proposed.

"BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan with a worldwide distribution, in warm-blood animals, including humans. Local conditions and environmental disturbances may influence transmission dynamics of a zoonotic agent. This study evaluates the epidemiology of T. gondii based on toxoplasmosis prevalence in two populations of cats living in distinct urbanization conditions in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. METHODS: Among 372 domestic cats sampled, 265 were from a public shelter located downtown Rio and 107 from a relatively preserved wild environment in a residential area. Sera and eluates from dried blood spots were tested for detection of IgG antibodies against T. gondii by modified agglutination test (MAT). RESULTS: Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 32/265 (12.08%) animals from the public shelter and in 4/107 (3.74%) cats from the residential area. Identical results were observed for sera and eluates. CONCLUSIONS: Filter paper provides a reliable accurate alternative storage option when conditions of sample collection and transportation in the field are unfavorable. The significantly lower prevalence in the residential area is discussed in terms of environmental, biological and behavioral features.

"Metagenomics is a powerful tool to identify novel or unexpected pathogens, since it is generic and relatively unbiased. The limit of detection (LOD) is a critical parameter for the routine application of methods in the clinical diagnostic context. Although attempts for the determination of LODs for metagenomics next-generation sequencing (mNGS) have been made previously, these were only applicable for specific target species in defined samples matrices. Therefore, we developed and validated a generalized probability-based model to assess the sample-specific LOD of mNGS experiments (LOD(mNGS)). Initial rarefaction analyses with datasets of Borna disease virus 1 human encephalitis cases revealed a stochastic behavior of virus read detection. Based on this, we transformed the Bernoulli formula to predict the minimal necessary dataset size to detect one virus read with a probability of 99%. We validated the formula with 30 datasets from diseased individuals, resulting in an accuracy of 99.1% and an average of 4.5 ± 0.4 viral reads found in the calculated minimal dataset size. We demonstrated by modeling the virus genome size, virus-, and total RNA-concentration that the main determinant of mNGS sensitivity is the virus-sample background ratio. The predicted LOD(mNGS) for the respective pathogenic virus in the datasets were congruent with the virus-concentration determined by RT-qPCR. Theoretical assumptions were further confirmed by correlation analysis of mNGS and RT-qPCR data from the samples of the analyzed datasets. This approach should guide standardization of mNGS application, due to the generalized concept of LOD(mNGS).

"BACKGROUND: Bartonella is a genus of Gram-negative facultative intracellular Alphaproteobacteria of public health importance. Although they are known to mainly infect mammalian hosts with some blood-feeding arthropods having been confirmed as vectors, there is some evidence of Bartonella association with non-mammalian hosts including birds. METHODS: Here we used high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA and Sanger sequencing of the citrate synthase (gltA) genes to test for the presence of Bartonellaceae in the blood of three migratory cavity nesting bird species, purple martins (Progne subis), tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis) and their most prevalent and abundant nest ectoparasites, Dermanyssus prognephilus (mite), Ceratophyllus idius (flea) and Protocalliphora sialia (bird blow fly larva). We constructed maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees to verify the placement of the resulting sequences in the Bartonellaceae. RESULTS: We found evidence of Bartonella in all three bird species and all three arthropod species tested. We report multiple instances of identical Bartonella sequences in both birds and parasites, leading to the likely hypothesis that these ectoparasites are potential vectors of Bartonella. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that 'avian Bartonella' may form its own sub-clade within the genus Bartonella. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first confirmation of overlapping Bartonella strains among bird hosts and various species of nest-associated ectoparasites from the same system, suggesting a possible Bartonella host-vector relationship between these arthropods and a non-mammalian host. Our study adds to the growing appreciation of the Bartonellaceae as a phylogenetically diverse group with a wide range of hosts.

"Ticks, as a group, are second only to mosquitoes as vectors of pathogens to humans and are the primary vector for pathogens of livestock, companion animals, and wildlife. The role of ticks in the transmission of viruses has been known for over 100 years and yet new pathogenic viruses are still being detected and known viruses are continually spreading to new geographic locations. Partly as a result of their novelty, tick-virus interactions are at an early stage in understanding. For some viruses, even the principal tick-vector is not known. It is likely that tick-borne viruses will continue to emerge and challenge public and veterinary health long into the twenty-first century. However, studies focusing on tick saliva, a critical component of tick feeding, virus transmission, and a target for control of ticks and tick-borne diseases, point toward solutions to emerging viruses. The aim of this review is to describe some currently emerging tick-borne diseases, their causative viruses, and to discuss research on virus-tick interactions. Through focus on this area, future protein targets for intervention and vaccine development may be identified.

"LINE-1 (L1) is a class of autonomous mobile genetic elements that form somatic mosaicisms in various tissues of the organism. The activity of L1 retrotransposons is strictly controlled by many factors in somatic and germ cells at all stages of ontogenesis. Alteration of L1 activity was noted in a number of diseases: in neuropsychiatric and autoimmune diseases, as well as in various forms of cancer. Altered activity of L1 retrotransposons for some pathologies is associated with epigenetic changes and defects in the genes involved in their repression. This review discusses the molecular genetic mechanisms of the retrotransposition and regulation of the activity of L1 elements. The contribution of various factors controlling the expression and distribution of L1 elements in the genome occurs at all stages of the retrotransposition. The regulation of L1 elements at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and integration into the genome stages is described in detail. Finally, this review also focuses on the evolutionary aspects of L1 accumulation and their interplay with the host regulation system.

"Wetlands are valuable habitats that provide important social, economic, and ecological services such as flood control, water quality improvement, carbon sequestration, pollutant removal, and primary/secondary production export to terrestrial and aquatic food chains. There is disagreement about the need for mosquito control in wetlands and about the techniques utilized for mosquito abatement and their impacts upon wetlands ecosystems. Mosquito control in wetlands is a complex issue influenced by numerous factors, including many hard to quantify elements such as human perceptions, cultural predispositions, and political climate. In spite of considerable progress during the last decades, habitat protection and environmentally sound habitat management still remain inextricably tied to politics and economics. Furthermore, the connections are often complex, and occur at several levels, ranging from local businesses and politicians, to national governments and multinational institutions. Education is the key to lasting wetlands conservation. Integrated mosquito abatement strategies incorporate many approaches and practicable options, as described herein, and need to be well-defined, effective, and ecologically and economically sound for the wetland type and for the mosquito species of concern. The approach will certainly differ in response to disease outbreaks caused by mosquito-vectored pathogens versus quality of life issues caused by nuisance-biting mosquitoes. In this contribution, we provide an overview of the ecological setting and context for mosquito control in wetlands, present pertinent information on wetlands mosquitoes, review the mosquito abatement options available for current wetlands managers and mosquito control professionals, and outline some necessary considerations when devising mosquito control strategies. Although the emphasis is on North American wetlands, most of the material is applicable to wetlands everywhere.

"Plague is a zoonotic disease, normally circulating in rodent populations, transmitted to humans most commonly through the bite of an infected flea vector. Secondary infection of the lungs results in generation of infectious aerosols, which pose a significant hazard to close contacts. In enzootic areas, plague infections have been reported in owners and veterinarians who come into contact with infected pets. Dogs are relatively resistant, but can import infected fleas into the home. Cats are acutely susceptible, and can present a direct hazard to health. Reducing roaming and hunting behaviours, combined with flea control measures go some way to reducing the risk to humans. Various vaccine formulations have been developed which may be suitable to protect companion animals from contracting plague, and thus preventing onward transmission to man. Since transmission has resulted in a number of fatal cases of plague, the vaccination of domestic animals such as cats would seem a low cost strategy for reducing the risk of infection by this serious disease in enzootic regions.

"mNGS(metagenomics Next Generation Sequencing), as a novel culture-independent approach, demonstrated the capability of rapid, sensitive, and accurate pathogen identification. At present, there have been many case reports about the use of mNGS to assist in the diagnosis of bacterial, fungal, viral and parasitic infections and to guide clinicians to determine appropriate treatment. However, the clinical understanding of this technique is not comprehensive, and the experience of using it is relatively limited. We reported a 53-year-old man who was admitted to hospital with a high fever and headache. His inflammatory biomarkers were markedly elevated. Based on the clinical presentation, He was initially diagnosed as having an intracranial infection of unknown etiology and received empirical antibiotics and systemic supportive treatment. But these did not relieve his symptoms. Both the blood and CSF specimens were examined using traditional culture, serological testing, and mNGS. Traditional culture and serological testing produced negative results, while the mNGS revealed the presence of a potential pathogen, mucor, in the CSF specimen. Then targeted antifungal treatment was selected quickly and his temperature gradually returned to normal. Thus, we report the case in which mNGS was an auxiliary method to diagnose mucormycosis, and discuss this case in combination with relevant literature, in order to improve the clinical cognition of this technology.

"Over the past two decades, the diagnosis rate for patients with encephalitis has remained poor despite advances in pathogen-specific testing such as PCR and antigen assays. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of RNA and DNA extracted from cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue now offers another strategy for diagnosing neurological infections. Given that mNGS simultaneously assays for a wide range of infectious agents in an unbiased manner, it can identify pathogens that were not part of a neurologist's initial differential diagnosis either because of the rarity of the infection, because the microorganism has not been previously associated with a clinical phenotype or because it is a newly discovered organism. This Review discusses the technical advantages and pitfalls of cerebrospinal fluid mNGS in the context of patients with neuroinflammatory syndromes, including encephalitis, meningitis and myelitis. We also speculate on how mNGS testing potentially fits into current diagnostic testing algorithms given data on mNGS test performance, cost and turnaround time. Finally, the Review highlights future directions for mNGS technology and other hypothesis-free testing methodologies that are in development.

"To identify carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) that might be particularly relevant for wood fiber processing, we performed a comparative metagenomic analysis of digestive systems from Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis) and North American moose (Alces americanus) following 3 years of enrichment on either microcrystalline cellulose or poplar hydrolysate. In total, 9,386 genes encoding CAZymes and carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) were identified, with up to half predicted to originate from Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, and Proteobacteria phyla, and up to 17% from unknown phyla. Both PCA and hierarchical cluster analysis distinguished the annotated glycoside hydrolase (GH) distributions identified herein, from those previously reported for grass-feeding mammals and herbivorous foragers. The CAZyme profile of moose rumen enrichments also differed from a recently reported moose rumen metagenome, most notably by the absence of GH13-appended dockerins. Consistent with substrate-driven convergence, CAZyme profiles from both poplar hydrolysate-fed cultures differed from cellulose-fed cultures, most notably by increased numbers of unique sequences belonging to families GH3, GH5, GH43, GH53, and CE1. Moreover, pairwise comparisons of moose rumen enrichments further revealed higher counts of GH127 and CE15 families in cultures fed with poplar hydrolysate. To expand our scope to lesser known carbohydrate-active proteins, we identified and compared multi-domain proteins comprising both a CBM and domain of unknown function (DUF) as well as proteins with unknown function within the 416 predicted polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). Interestingly, DUF362, identified in iron-sulfur proteins, was consistently appended to CBM9; on the other hand, proteins with unknown function from PULs shared little identity unless from identical PULs. Overall, this study sheds new light on the lignocellulose degrading capabilities of microbes originating from digestive systems of mammals known for fiber-rich diets, and highlights the value of enrichment to select new CAZymes from metagenome sequences for future biochemical characterization.

"We examined the reservoir potential of white-tailed deer for Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Results suggest that white-tailed deer harbor a variant strain not associated with human infection, but contrary to published reports, white-tailed deer are not a reservoir for strains that cause human disease. These results will affect surveillance studies of vector and reservoir populations.

"Bartonella spp. are facultative intracellular bacteria that cause characteristic hostrestricted hemotropic infections in mammals and are typically transmitted by blood-sucking arthropods. In the mammalian reservoir, these bacteria initially infect a yet unrecognized primary niche, which seeds organisms into the blood stream leading to the establishment of a long-lasting intra-erythrocytic bacteremia as the hall-mark of infection. Bacterial type IV secretion systems, which are supra-molecular transporters ancestrally related to bacterial conjugation systems, represent crucial pathogenicity factors that have contributed to a radial expansion of the Bartonella lineage in nature by facilitating adaptation to unique mammalian hosts. On the molecular level, the type IV secretion system VirB/VirD4 is known to translocate a cocktail of different effector proteins into host cells, which subvert multiple cellular functions to the benefit of the infecting pathogen. Furthermore, bacterial adhesins mediate a critical, early step in the pathogenesis of the bartonellae by binding to extracellular matrix components of host cells, which leads to firm bacterial adhesion to the cell surface as a prerequisite for the efficient translocation of type IV secretion effector proteins. The best-studied adhesins in bartonellae are the orthologous trimeric autotransporter adhesins, BadA in Bartonella henselae and the Vomp family in Bartonella quintana. Genetic diversity and strain variability also appear to enhance the ability of bartonellae to invade not only specific reservoir hosts, but also accidental hosts, as shown for B. henselae. Bartonellae have been identified in many different blood-sucking arthropods, in which they are typically found to cause extracellular infections of the mid-gut epithelium. Adaptation to specific vectors and reservoirs seems to be a common strategy of bartonellae for transmission and host diversity. However, knowledge regarding arthropod specificity/restriction, the mode of transmission, and the bacterial factors involved in arthropod infection and transmission is still limited.

"The causative agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis was recently reclassified as Anaplasma phagocytophilum, unifying previously described bacteria that cause disease in humans, horses, dogs, and ruminants. For the characterization of genetic heterogeneity in this species, the homologue of Anaplasma marginale major surface protein 4 gene (msp4) was identified, and the coding region was PCR amplified and sequenced from a variety of sources, including 50 samples from the United States, Germany, Poland, Norway, Italy, and Switzerland and 4 samples of A. phagocytophilum-like organisms obtained from white-tailed deer in the United States. Sequence variation between strains of A. phagocytophilum (90 to 100% identity at the nucleotide level and 92 to 100% similarity at the protein level) was higher than in A. marginale. Phylogenetic analyses of msp4 sequences did not provide phylogeographic information but did differentiate strains of A. phagocytophilum obtained from ruminants from those obtained from humans, dogs, and horses. The sequence analysis of the recently discovered A. phagocytophilum msp2 gene corroborated these results. The results reported here suggest that although A. phagocytophilum-like organisms from white-tailed deer may be closely related to A. phagocytophilum, they could be more diverse. These results suggest that A. phagocytophilum strains from ruminants could share some common characteristics, including reservoirs and pathogenicity, which may be different from strains that infect humans.

"Our recent work has shown that a rice thizospheric natural isolate, a Pantoea sp (hereafter EA106) attenuates Arsenic (As) uptake in rice. In parallel, yet another natural rice rhizospheric isolate, a Pseudomonas chlororaphis (hereafter EA105), was shown to inhibit rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Considering the above, we envisaged to evaluate the importance of mixed stress regime in rice plants subjected to both As toxicity and blast infections. Plants subjected to As regime showed increased susceptibility to blast infections compared to As-untreated plants. Rice blast pathogen M. oryzae showed significant resistance against As toxicity compared to other non-host fungal pathogens. Interestingly, plants treated with EA106 showed reduced susceptibility against blast infections in plants pre-treated with As. This data also corresponded with lower As uptake in plants primed with EA106. In addition, we also evaluated the expression of defense related genes in host plants subjected to As treatment. The data showed that plants primed with EA106 upregulated defense-related genes with or without As treatment. The data shows the first evidence of how rice plants cope with mixed stress regimes. Our work highlights the importance of natural association of plant microbiome which determines the efficacy of benign microbes to promote the development of beneficial traits in plants.

"In recent years the group of arboviruses has been attracting considerable interest as causative agent of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases in humans. The importance of arboviruses for transfusion medicine has been discussed in an earlier publication of this working group [1]. Especially West Nile virus (WNV), a member of the family of Flaviviridae, has been gaining particular attention during the last years. Since its first description in 1940 this pathogen had been assumed to have a broad geographical distribution (Africa, Asia, Middle East, Southern Europe and Australia (with subtype Kunjin virus)), but usually its pathogenicity has been considered to be low or moderate. This perception changed in 1999 when WNV was first detected in the USA, and infections with this virus induced severe human central nervous system disorders, some of them with fatal outcome. This led to a reassessment of previous WNV outbreaks in Europe and an intensification of the epidemiological surveillance. Since then thorough investigations have been addressing the epidemiology and pathogenesis as well as the biological properties of the virus."
"BACKGROUND: Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) is a gram-negative intracellular parasitic pathogenic bacterium that can infect avian and mammalian hosts, including humans. The detection of C. psittaci infections typically relies on traditional antigen-based immunoassays or serological testing that often lack sensitivity and/or specificity. Metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS) is an emerging tool for diagnosis. AIM: To demonstrate that mNGS represents a valuable tool for rapid, sensitive, and accurate pathogen detection including C. psittaci infections. METHODS: Four cases of psittacosis pneumonia and one case of pediatric psittacosis meningitis were diagnosed between December 2019 and May 2020 using mNGS at Changzhou Second People's Hospital affiliated to Nanjing Medical University. Patients' clinical characteristics, manifestations, and treatment histories were retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: All five patients had a history of exposure to wild (psittacine or other birds) or domesticated birds (chickens). All patients had a high fever (> 39℃) and three of them (60%) experienced organ insufficiency during the disease. The laboratory data showed normal to slightly increased leucocyte and neutrophil counts, and elevated procalcitonin levels in all five cases, and very high C-reactive protein levels in psittacosis pneumonia patients. mNGS identified a potential pathogen, C. psittaci, in patients' bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or cerebrospinal fluid. Computed tomography revealed lung air-space consolidation, pleural thickening, and effusion fluid buildup in psittacosis pneumonia cases, and an arachnoid cyst in the right temporal lobe of the pediatric psittacosis meningitis patient. All patients experienced complete recovery following the administration of targeted anti-chlamydia therapy. CONCLUSION: This study not only demonstrated that mNGS represents a valuable tool for rapid, sensitive, and accurate pathogen detection, but also raised public health concerns over C. psittaci infections.

"Day-active tree shrews have a well-developed internal capsule (ic) that clearly separates the caudate nucleus (Cd) and putamen (Pu). The striatum consists of the Cd, ic, Pu, and accumbens nucleus (Acb). Here, we characterized the cytoarchitecture of the striatum and the whole-brain inputs to the Cd, Pu, and Acb in tree shrews by using immunohistochemistry and the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold (FG). Our data show the distribution patterns of parvalbumin (PV), nitric oxide synthase (NOS), calretinin (CR), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the striatum of tree shrews, which were different from those observed in rats. The Cd and Pu mainly received inputs from the thalamus, motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, and other cortical and subcortical regions, whereas the Acb primarily received inputs from the anterior olfactory nucleus, claustrum, infralimbic cortex, thalamus, raphe nucleus, parabrachial nucleus, ventral tegmental area, and so on. The Cd, Pu, and Acb received inputs from different neuronal populations in the ipsilateral (60, 67, and 63 brain regions, respectively) and contralateral (23, 20, and 36 brain regions, respectively) brain hemispheres. Overall, we demonstrate that there are species differences between tree shrews and rats in the density of PV, NOS, CR, and TH immunoreactivity in the striatum. Additionally, we mapped for the first time the distribution of whole-brain input neurons projecting to the striatum of tree shrews with FG injected into the Cd, Pu, and Acb. The similarities and differences in their brain-wide input patterns may provide new insights into the diverse functions of the striatal subregions.

"Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has progressed enormously over the past decade, transforming genomic analysis and opening up many new opportunities for applications in clinical microbiology laboratories. The impact of NGS on microbiology has been revolutionary, with new microbial genomic sequences being generated daily, leading to the development of large databases of genomes and gene sequences. The ability to analyze microbial communities without culturing organisms has created the ever-growing field of metagenomics and microbiome analysis and has generated significant new insights into the relation between host and microbe. The medical literature contains many examples of how this new technology can be used for infectious disease diagnostics and pathogen analysis. The implementation of NGS in medical practice has been a slow process due to various challenges such as clinical trials, lack of applicable regulatory guidelines, and the adaptation of the technology to the clinical environment. In April 2015, the American Academy of Microbiology (AAM) convened a colloquium to begin to define these issues, and in this document, we present some of the concepts that were generated from these discussions.

"BACKGROUND: Hyperaccumulation, the rare capacity of certain plant species to accumulate toxic trace elements to levels several orders of magnitude higher than other species growing on the same site, is thought to be an elemental defense mechanism against herbivores and pathogens. Previous research has shown that selenium (Se) hyperaccumulation protects plants from a variety of herbivores and pathogens. Selenium hyperaccumulating plants sequester Se in discrete locations in the leaf periphery, making them potentially more susceptible to some herbivore feeding modes than others. In this study we investigate the protective function of Se in the Se hyperaccumulators Stanleya pinnata and Astragalus bisulcatus against two cell disrupting herbivores, the western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) and the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae). RESULTS: Astragalus bisulcatus and S. pinnata with high Se concentrations (greater than 650 mg Se kg(-1)) were less subject to thrips herbivory than plants with low Se levels (less than 150 mg Se kg(-1)). Furthermore, in plants containing elevated Se levels, leaves with higher concentrations of Se suffered less herbivory than leaves with less Se. Spider mites also preferred to feed on low-Se A. bisulcatus and S. pinnata plants rather than high-Se plants. Spider mite populations on A. bisulcatus decreased after plants were given a higher concentration of Se. Interestingly, spider mites could colonize A. bisulcatus plants containing up to 200 mg Se kg(-1) dry weight, concentrations which are toxic to many other herbivores. Selenium distribution and speciation studies using micro-focused X-ray fluorescence (μXRF) mapping and Se K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that the spider mites accumulated primarily methylselenocysteine, the relatively non-toxic form of Se that is also the predominant form of Se in hyperaccumulators. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported study investigating the protective effect of hyperaccumulated Se against cell-disrupting herbivores. The finding that Se protected the two hyperaccumulator species from both cell disruptors lends further support to the elemental defense hypothesis and increases the number of herbivores and feeding modes against which Se has shown a protective effect. Because western flower thrips and two-spotted spider mites are widespread and economically important herbivores, the results from this study also have potential applications in agriculture or horticulture, and implications for the management of Se-rich crops.

"We define co-introduced parasites as those which have been transported with an alien host to a new locality, outside of their natural range, and co-invading parasites as those which have been co-introduced and then spread to new, native hosts. Of 98 published studies of co-introductions, over 50% of hosts were freshwater fishes and 49% of parasites were helminths. Although we would expect parasites with simple, direct life cycles to be much more likely to be introduced and establish in a new locality, a substantial proportion (36%) of co-introductions were of parasites with an indirect life cycle. Seventy-eight per cent of co-introduced parasites were found in native host species and can therefore be classed as co-invaders. Host switching was equally common among parasites with direct and indirect life cycles. The magnitude of the threat posed to native species by co-invaders will depend, among other things, on parasite virulence. In 16 cases where co-introduced parasites have switched to native hosts and information was available on relative virulence, 14 (85%) were more virulent in native hosts than in the co-introduced alien host. We argue that this does not necessarily support the naïve host theory that co-invading parasites will have greater pathogenic effects in native hosts with which they have no coevolutionary history, but may instead be a consequence of the greater likelihood for parasites with lower virulence in their natural host to be co-introduced.

"The globular region of hemagglutinin (residues 91-261) membrane glycoprotein of influenza virus that encompasses the binding zone to the oligosaccharide receptor of target cells has been cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). This protein segment (denoted HA91-261 peptide) induced significant immune response in mice. The serum antibodies and lung homogenates from the immunized mice cross-reacted with native virus particles. The cellular immunity was manifested by proliferative splenocyte responses and cytokine release indicating T helper type 1 activity. The plasmid DNA containing this segment (denoted pHA91-261) provoked, in addition, a significant cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response, whereas the HA91-261 protein fragment led to no such response. Both the DNA and the protein fragment of HA91-261 induced significant protection against viral challenge, although the immune response they induce might be along different pathways. Interestingly, the combined DNA priming-protein boosting immunization regimen did not induce protection against viral challenges even though it led to significant humoral immune responses similar to that induced by the peptide vaccine.

"Studies have indicated that ectopic expression of p202, an interferon (IFN)-inducible retinoblastoma (Rb)-binding protein, in cultured cells retards cell proliferation and modulates cell survival. Consistent with a role of p202 in cell cycle regulation, levels of p202 increase in cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle after withdrawal of serum growth factors. However, a role for p202 in cell growth arrest remains to be defined. Moreover, it remains unclear how levels of p202 are upregulated during the cell growth arrest. Here, we report that Rb upregulates expression of Ifi202 gene. We found that basal as well as IFN-induced levels of p202 were significantly higher in wild-type (Rb(+/+)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) than isogenic Rb(-/-) MEFs. Consistent with the regulation of Ifi202 gene by Rb, expression of functional Rb, but not a pocket mutant of it, stimulated the activity of a reporter whose expression was driven by the 5'-regulatory region of Ifi202 gene. Importantly, the stimulation by Rb was dependent, in part, on a JunD/AP-1 DNA-binding site present in the 5'-regulatory region of the Ifi202 gene. Moreover, basal levels of p202 were significantly higher in wild-type (JunD(+/+)) than isogenic JunD(-/-) MEFs. Additionally, we found that increased expression of p202 potentiated the Rb-mediated inhibition of cell growth and mutations in the Rb-binding motif (LxCxE) of p202 significantly reduced cell survival. Together, our observations support the idea that the transcriptional activation of Ifi202 gene by Rb/JunD may be important for the regulation of cell growth and survival.

"Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 4 (LGR4) suppresses food intake after its activation by binding of its ligands, R-spondins. We investigated the mechanism of food intake suppression by R-spondin1 in a region-specific Lgr4 gene knockout (LGR4 cKO) mouse model, generated by deletion of the Lgr4 gene in arcuate nucleus (ARC) using Lgr4(fx/fx) mice combined with infection of an AAV-Cre vector. After R-spondin1 administration, LGR4 cKO mice didn't exhibit a suppressed appetite, compared to that in control mice, which received a vehicle. In ARC of LGR4 cKO mice, Pomc mRNA expression was reduced, leading to suppressed food intake. On the other hand, neurons-specific LGR4 KO mice exhibited no differences in Pomc expression, and no structural differences were observed in the ARC of mutant mice. These results suggest that LGR4 is an essential part of the mechanism, inducing Pomc gene expression with R-spondin1 in ARC neurons in mice, thereby regulating feeding behavior. Abbreviations: LGR4: Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 4; RSPOs: roof plate-specific spondins; ARC: arcuate nucleus; AAV: adeno associated virus; POMC: pro-opiomelanocortin; CART: cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript; NPY: neuropeptide Y; AgRP: agouti-related peptide; Axin2: axis inhibition protein 2; Lef1: lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1; ccnd1: cyclin D1.

"INTRODUCTION: Particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone are recognized as the three pollutants that most significantly affect human health. Asthma is a multifactorial disease. However, the place of residence has rarely been investigated. We compared the impact of air pollution, measured near patients' homes, on emergency department (ED) visits for asthma or trauma (controls) within the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur region. METHODS: Variables were selected using classification and regression trees on asthmatic and control population, 3-99 years, visiting ED from January 1 to December 31, 2013. Then in a nested case control study, randomization was based on the day of ED visit and on defined age groups. Pollution, meteorological, pollens and viral data measured that day were linked to the patient's ZIP code. RESULTS: A total of 794,884 visits were reported including 6250 for asthma and 278,192 for trauma. Factors associated with an excess risk of emergency visit for asthma included short-term exposure to NO(2), female gender, high viral load and a combination of low temperature and high humidity. CONCLUSION: Short-term exposures to high NO(2) concentrations, as assessed close to the homes of the patients, were significantly associated with asthma-related ED visits in children and adults.

"Intracellular aminopeptidases endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases 1 and 2 (ERAP1 and ERAP2), and as well as insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) process antigenic epitope precursors for loading onto MHC class I molecules and regulate the adaptive immune response. Their activity greatly affects the antigenic peptide repertoire presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes and as a result can regulate cytotoxic cellular responses contributing to autoimmunity or immune evasion by viruses and cancer cells. Therefore, pharmacological regulation of their activity is a promising avenue for modulating the adaptive immune response with possible applications in controlling autoimmunity, in boosting immune responses to pathogens, and in cancer immunotherapy. In this study we exploited recent structural and biochemical analysis of ERAP1 and ERAP2 to design and develop phosphinic pseudopeptide transition state analogs that can inhibit this family of enzymes with nM affinity. X-ray crystallographic analysis of one such inhibitor in complex with ERAP2 validated our design, revealing a canonical mode of binding in the active site of the enzyme, and highlighted the importance of the S2' pocket for achieving inhibitor potency. Antigen processing and presentation assays in HeLa and murine colon carcinoma (CT26) cells showed that these inhibitors induce increased cell-surface antigen presentation of transfected and endogenous antigens and enhance cytotoxic T-cell responses, indicating that these enzymes primarily destroy epitopes in those systems. This class of inhibitors constitutes a promising tool for controlling the cellular adaptive immune response in humans by modulating the antigen processing and presentation pathway.

"BACKGROUND: Virus-free sugarcane is difficult to achieve due to the multiple vegetative propagation cycles employed commercially. In vitro culture using small (1 mm) meristematic shoot tips has eliminated viruses but survival is low with small explants. OBJECTIVE: Droplet-Vitrification (D-V) and V-Cryoplate protocols were investigated for the elimination of Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) from large (c. 3 mm) in vitro-derived shoot tips. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Shoot tips excised from NCo376 and N19 cultivars were exposed to both cryogenic procedures. Virus indexing by RT-qPCR was performed 16 weeks after recovery. RESULTS: Explants exposed to cryo-treatments that recovered and multiplied was 30-92%, while at least 90% of control explants regenerated. No virus was detected in multiplied shoots from either cultivar after D-V and liquid nitrogen immersion. In NCo376, virus was eliminated after D-V without cooling. CONCLUSION: The preliminary findings suggest that cryotherapy and/or osmotherapy are viable options for SCMV removal from infected plants.

"Oncolytic herpes viruses are attenuated, replication-competent viruses that selectively infect, replicate within, and lyse cancer cells and are highly efficacious in the treatment of a wide variety of experimental cancers. The current study seeks to define the pharmacologic interactions between chemotherapeutic drugs and the oncolytic herpes viral strain NV1066 in the treatment of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The human pancreatic cancer cell lines Hs 700T, PANC-1, and MIA PaCa-2 were treated in vitro with NV1066 at multiplicities of infection (MOI; ratio of the number of viral particles per tumor cell) ranging from 0.01 to 1.0 with or without 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or gemcitabine. Synergistic efficacy was determined by the isobologram and combination-index methods of Chou and Talalay. Viral replication was measured using a standard plaque assay. Six days after combination therapy, 76% of Hs 700T cells were killed compared with 43% with NV1066 infection alone (MOI = 0.1) or 0% with 5-FU alone (2 micromol/L) (P < .01). Isobologram and combination-index analyses confirmed a strongly synergistic pharmacologic interaction between the agents at all viral and drug combinations tested (LD5 to LD95) in the three cell lines. Dose reductions up to 6- and 78-fold may be achieved with combination therapy for NV1066 and 5-FU, respectively, without compromising cell kill. 5-FU increased viral replication up to 19-fold compared with cells treated with virus alone. Similar results were observed by combining gemcitabine and NV1066. We have demonstrated that 5-FU and gemcitabine potentiate oncolytic herpes viral replication and cytotoxicity across a range of clinically achievable doses in the treatment of human pancreatic cancer cell lines. The potential clinical implications of this synergistic interaction include improvements in efficacy, treatment-associated toxicity, tolerability of therapeutic regimens, and quality of life. These data provide the cellular basis for the clinical investigation of combined oncolytic herpes virus therapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

"Little is known about the presence of human pathogenic Puumala virus (PUUV) in Lithuania. We detected this virus in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in a region of this country in which previously PUUV-seropositive humans were identified. Our results are consistent with heterogeneous distributions of PUUV in other countries in Europe.

"The four members of the MAD family are bHLHZip proteins that heterodimerize with MAX and act as transcriptional repressors. The switch from MYC-MAX complexes to MAD-MAX complexes has been postulated to couple cell-cycle arrest with differentiation. The ectopic expression of Mad1 in transgenic mice led to early postnatal lethality and dwarfism and had a profound inhibitory effect on the proliferation of the hematopoietic cells and embryonic fibroblasts derived from these animals. Compared to wild-type cells, Mad1 transgenic fibroblasts arrested with altered morphology and reduced density at confluence, cycled more slowly, and were delayed in their progression from G0 to the S phase. These changes were accompanied by accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein and p130. Cyclin D1-associated kinase activity was dramatically reduced in MAD1-overexpressing fibroblasts. However, wild-type cell-cycle distribution and morphology could be rescued in the Mad1 transgenic cells by the introduction of HPV-E7, but not an E7 mutant incapable of binding to pocket proteins. This indicates that the activities of the retinoblastoma family members, via the cyclin D pathway, are likely to be the major targets for MAD1-mediated inhibition of proliferation in primary mouse fibroblasts.

"BACKGROUND: Evidence of gender differences in antiretroviral treatment (ART) outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa is conflicting. Our objective was to assess gender differences in (1) adherence to ART and (2) virologic failure, immune reconstitution, mortality, and disease progression adjusting for adherence. METHODS: Cohort study among 459 ART-naive patients followed up 24 months after initiation in 2006-2010 in 9 rural district hospitals. Adherence to ART was assessed using (1) a validated tool based on multiple patient self-reports and (2) antiretroviral plasma concentrations. The associations between gender and the outcomes were assessed using multivariate mixed models or accelerated time failure models. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five patients (29.4%) were men. At baseline, men were older, had higher body mass index and hemoglobin level, and received more frequently efavirenz than women. Gender was not associated with self-reported adherence (P = 0.872, 0.169, and 0.867 for moderate adherence, low adherence, and treatment interruption, respectively) or with antiretroviral plasma concentrations (P = 0.549 for nevirapine/efavirenz). In contrast, male gender was associated with virologic failure [odds ratio: 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.31 to 3.62, P = 0.003], lower immunologic reconstitution (coefficient: -58.7 at month 24, 95% CI: -100.8 to -16.6, P = 0.006), and faster progression to death (time ratio: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.78, P = 0.014) and/or to World Health Organization stage 4 event (time ratio: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.79, P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides important evidence that African men are more vulnerable to ART failure than women and that the male vulnerability extends beyond adherence issues. Additional studies are needed to determine the causes for this vulnerability to optimize HIV care. However, personalized adherence support remains crucial.

"The Rb protein is known to exert its activity at decision points in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. To investigate whether it may also play some role(s) at later points in the cell cycle, we used a system of rapid inducible gene amplification to conditionally overexpress Rb protein during G2 phase. A cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 large T antigen (T-Ag) was stably transfected with plasmids containing the Rb cDNA linked to the simian virus 40 origin of replication: pRB-wt, pRB-fs, and pRB-Dra, carrying wild-type murine Rb cDNA, a frameshift mutation close to the beginning of the Rb coding region, and a single-amino-acid deletion in the E1A/T-Ag binding pocket, respectively. Numerous independent cell lines were isolated at the nonpermissive temperature; cell lines displaying a high level of episomal amplification of an intact Rb expression cassette following shiftdown to the permissive temperature were chosen for further analysis. Plasmid pRB-fs did not express detectable Rb antigen, while pRB-Dra expressed full-length Rb protein. The Dra mutation has previously been shown to abrogate phosphorylation as well as T-Ag binding. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed that cultures induced to overexpress either wild-type or Dra mutant Rb proteins were significantly enriched for cells with a G2 DNA content. Cultures that amplified pRB-fs or rearranged pRB-wt and did not express Rb protein had normal cell cycle profiles. Double-label FACS analysis showed that cells overexpressing Rb or Rb-Dra proteins were uniformly accumulating in G2, whereas cells expressing endogenous levels of Rb were found throughout the cell cycle. These results indicate that Rb protein is interacting with some component(s) of the cell cycle-regulatory machinery during G2 phase.

"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) based oncolytic viruses are promising agents against various cancers. We have shown that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines exhibit great diversity in susceptibility and permissibility to VSV. Here, using a directed evolution approach with our two previously described oncolytic VSV recombinants, VSV-p53wt and VSV-p53-CC, we generated novel oncolytic VSVs with an improved ability to replicate in virus-resistant PDAC cell lines. VSV-p53wt and VSV-p53-CC encode a VSV matrix protein (M) with a ΔM51 mutation (M-ΔM51) and one of two versions of a functional human tumor suppressor, p53, fused to a far-red fluorescent protein, eqFP650. Each virus was serially passaged 32 times (which accounts for more than 60 viral replication cycles) on either the SUIT-2 (moderately resistant to VSV) or MIA PaCa-2 (highly permissive to VSV) human PDAC cell lines. While no phenotypic changes were observed for MIA PaCa-2-passaged viruses, both SUIT-2-passaged VSV-p53wt and VSV-p53-CC showed improved replication in SUIT-2 and AsPC-1, another human PDAC cell line also moderately resistant to VSV, while remaining highly attenuated in nonmalignant cells. Surprisingly, two identical VSV glycoprotein (VSV-G) mutations, K174E and E238K, were identified in both SUIT-2-passaged viruses. Additional experiments indicated that the acquired G mutations improved VSV replication, at least in part due to improved virus attachment to SUIT-2 cells. Importantly, no mutations were found in the M-ΔM51 protein, and no deletions or mutations were found in the p53 or eqFP650 portions of virus-carried transgenes in any of the passaged viruses, demonstrating long-term genomic stability of complex VSV recombinants carrying large transgenes.IMPORTANCE Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based oncolytic viruses are promising agents against pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, some PDAC cell lines are resistant to VSV. Here, using a directed viral evolution approach, we generated novel oncolytic VSVs with an improved ability to replicate in virus-resistant PDAC cell lines, while remaining highly attenuated in nonmalignant cells. Two independently evolved VSVs obtained 2 identical VSV glycoprotein mutations, K174E and E238K. Additional experiments indicated that these acquired G mutations improved VSV replication, at least in part due to improved virus attachment to SUIT-2 cells. Importantly, no deletions or mutations were found in the virus-carried transgenes in any of the passaged viruses. Our findings demonstrate long-term genomic stability of complex VSV recombinants carrying large transgenes and support further clinical development of oncolytic VSV recombinants as safe therapeutics for cancer.

"BACKGROUND: The aims of our study were to estimate the measle-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage in 3 years old children in 12 French countees, to document the evolution between 1997 and 1999 in two groups of 6 countees (pilot group and control group) before and after the implementation of promotion programmes in the pilot group, and to identify factors related to measle-mumps-rubella vaccination. METHODS: Two telephone surveys were carried out in 1997 and 1999 among children randomly selected in the birth rolls of 12 French countees. Parents of 3 years old children were interviewed on measle-mumps-rubella vaccination, knowledge and opinions on vaccinations, utilisation of health care and socio-demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The participation rate was 97% in both surveys. Among the 7382 respondent parents, 98% had immediate access to the child's medical file and could document the vaccine status. The vaccine coverage did not increase significantly between 1997 and 1999 (86.7% versus 87.2%), both in control (89.3% vs. 90.2%) and pilot groups (84.3% vs. 84.3%). A logistic regression model showed that several factors were independently and significantly related to measle-mumps-rubella vaccination (utilisation of homeopathic medicines, mother's age, number of children, physician speciality (general practitioner or pediatrician) and opinion on vaccinations). CONCLUSION: Our study shows that there is a stagnation of vaccine coverage in several French countees, which makes unlikely the national objective of viruses eradication. This epidemiological situation makes very likely outbreaks of measles, mumps and rubella in these countees. National and local pilot programmes did not succeed to promote vaccination in countees with a low measle-mumps-rubella vaccine coverage. Our study identified sub-groups of parents who should be targeted by promotion programmes.

"BACKGROUND: Detection, isolation, and identification of individual virus infected cells during long term infection are critical to advance our understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis for latent/persistent viruses. However, current approaches to study these viruses in vivo have been hampered by low sensitivity and effects of cell-type on expression of viral encoded reporter genes. We have designed a novel Cre recombinase (Cre)-based murine system to overcome these problems, and thereby enable tracking and isolation of individual in vivo infected cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) was used as a prototypic persistent model virus. A Cre expressing recombinant virus was constructed and characterised. The virus is attenuated both in lytic virus replication, producing ten-fold lower lung virus titres than wild type virus, and in the establishment of latency. However, despite this limitation, when the sEGFP7 mouse line containing a Cre-activated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was infected with the Cre expressing virus, sites of latent and persistent virus infection could be identified within B cells and macrophages of the lymphoid system on the basis of EGFP expression. Importantly, the use of the sEGFP7 mouse line which expresses high levels of EGFP allowed individual virus positive cells to be purified by FACSorting. Virus gene expression could be detected in these cells. Low numbers of EGFP positive cells could also be detected in the bone marrow. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The use of this novel Cre-based virus/mouse system allowed identification of individual latently infected cells in vivo and may be useful for the study and long-term monitoring of other latent/persistent virus infections.

"Leptin regulates both feeding and glycaemia primarily through its receptors expressed on agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and pro-opiomelanocortin-expressing (POMC) neurons; however, it is unknown whether activity of these neuronal populations mediates the regulation of these processes. To determine this, we injected Cre-dependent designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) viruses into the hypothalamus of normoglycaemic and diabetic AgRP-ires-cre and POMC-cre mice to chemogenetically activate or inhibit these neuronal populations. Despite robust changes in food intake, activation or inhibition of AgRP neurons did not affect glycaemia, while activation caused significant (P = 0.014) impairment in insulin sensitivity. Stimulation of AgRP neurons in diabetic mice reversed leptin's ability to inhibit feeding but did not counter leptin's ability to lower blood glucose levels. Notably, the inhibition of POMC neurons stimulated feeding while decreasing glucose levels in normoglycaemic mice. The findings suggest that leptin's effects on feeding by AgRP neurons are mediated by changes in neuronal firing, while the control of glucose balance by these cells is independent of chemogenetic activation or inhibition. The firing-dependent glucose lowering mechanism within POMC neurons is a potential target for the development of novel anti-diabetic medicines.

"A clone encoding PrP 27-30, the major protein in purified preparations of scrapie agent, was selected from a scrapie-infected hamster brain cDNA library by oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the N terminus of the protein. Southern blotting with PrP cDNA revealed a single gene with the same restriction patterns in normal and scrapie-infected brain DNA. A single PrP-related gene was also detected in murine and human DNA. PrP-related mRNA was found at similar levels in normal and scrapie-infected hamster brain, as well as in many other normal tissues. Using antisera against PrP 27-30, a PrP-related protein was detected in crude extracts of infected brain and to a lesser extent in extracts of normal brain. Proteinase K digestion yielded PrP 27-30 in infected brain extract, but completely degraded the PrP-related protein in normal brain extract. No PrP-related nucleic acids were found in purified preparations of scrapie prions, indicating that PrP 27-30 is not encoded by a nucleic acid carried within the infectious particles.

"Homogenous eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were found within the large reticular neurons of the brain stems of 57 captive woodchucks (Marmota monax). Light microscopy was consistent with a proteinaceous nature, while electron microscopy suggested a non-viral origin. The woodchucks with inclusions were older than the general population that was studied. It is hypothesized that the neuronal inclusions in the brain stem are indicative of nonspecific ageing changes.

"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors (PIs) have been used successfully in extending the life span of people infected with HIV. The use of PIs has also been associated with dyslipidemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Several PIs have been implicated in activating the nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR), which acts as a xenobiotic sensor to regulate xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine. Recent studies indicate that PXR may also play an important role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. In the present study, we identified amprenavir, a widely used HIV PI, as a potent PXR-selective agonist. Computational docking studies combined with site-direct mutagenesis identified several key residues within the ligand-binding pocket of PXR that constitute points of interaction with amprenavir. Amprenavir efficiently activated PXR and induced PXR target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Short-term exposure to amprenavir significantly increased plasma total cholesterol and atherogenic low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in wild-type mice, but not in PXR-deficient mice. Amprenavir-mediated PXR activation stimulated the expression of several key intestinal genes involved in lipid homeostasis. These findings provide critical mechanistic insight for understanding the impact of PIs on cardiovascular disease and demonstrate a potential role of PXR in mediating the adverse effects of HIV PIs in humans.

"CSF-1 is a growth and differentiation factor for the production of mononuclear phagocytes from undifferentiated bone marrow progenitors. In addition to previously described effects on mature cells, we show here that CSF-1 stimulates the production by monocytes of interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and myeloid CSF that produces mainly mixed neutrophil-macrophage colonies in bone marrow culture. Pretreatment with CSF-1 also promotes resistance to viral infection and tumor cytotoxicity in murine peritoneal macrophages. Based on amino acid sequence data of purified human urinary and murine L cell CSF-1, we have cloned the complementary DNA (cDNA) from messenger RNA (mRNA) of the human CSF-1 producing MIA PaCa cell line. The cDNA specifies a 32 amino acid signal peptide followed by a protein of 224 amino acids. Several facts suggest, however, that one-third of the molecule at the C-terminal end is processed off intracellularly to derive the secreted growth factor. The gene is about 18 kilobases (kb) in length and contains 9 exons. Although there appears to be a single copy gene for CSF-1, cells expressing the factor contain several mRNA species, suggesting that the gene may have several functions or levels of regulation. High level expression of the recombinant protein will allow preclinical testing in several disease models for therapeutic efficacy that has been suggested from in vitro and in vivo biological properties of CSF-1.

"Wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) from one study area in England have been used over a period of 11 years to investigate the possible appearance of innate resistance to myxomatosis. Rabbits of 4-6 weeks old were captured alive, retained in the laboratory until at least 4 months old, and then infected with a type of myxoma virus which kills 90-95% of laboratory rabbits. Observations were made of symptoms, mortality rate and survival times.In the first 4 years of the study (1966-9), mortality rates were not significantly different from those of laboratory rabbits, although survival times of wild rabbits were appreciably longer. In 1970, the mortality rate amongst wild rabbits was 59%, in 1974 it was 17%, and in 1976 it was 20%, thus showing that a considerable degree of inherited resistance to myxomatosis has developed.The types of myxoma virus most commonly isolated from wild rabbits in Great Britain in recent years have been those which cause 70-95% mortality in laboratory rabbits. Therefore, if the degree of innate resistance demonstrated is widespread in Great Britain, there are serious implications regarding the size of the rabbit population, because myxomatosis has been an important factor in holding rabbit numbers at a relatively low level.

"Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide. Previous research has demonstrated its neuroprotective effects in the elderly. People coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) experience an accelerated aging process and cognitive impairment, which significantly impair quality of life and may affect disease-related dimensions such as treatment adherence. This study aimed to analyse the relationship between regular coffee intake and neurocognitive performance (NCP) in HIV-HCV coinfected people. We used data from 139 coinfected patients who participated in both the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort and the HEPAVIH-Psy cross-sectional survey. Linear regression models adjusting for potential sociodemographic (age, gender, educational level), clinical (liver disease status, ongoing HCV treatment, HIV viral load, major depressive disorder) and socio-behavioural (cannabis use) correlates of NCP were used. Our results showed significant, positive associations between elevated coffee intake (ECI) (three or more cups of coffee per day) and NCP in verbal fluency, psychomotor speed (coding) and executive functioning. ECI might therefore preserve neurocognitive functioning in people living with HIV and HCV.

"The virulence of field strains of myxoma virus is increasing in the Mallee region of Victoria where the resistance of the rabbit to myxomatosis is high. This suggests that the climax association will be a moderately severe disease.

"In the vast majority of influenza A viruses characterized to date, hemagglutinin (HA) is the receptor-binding and fusion protein, whereas neuraminidase (NA) is a receptor-cleaving protein that facilitates viral release but is expendable for entry. However, the NAs of some recent human H3N2 isolates have acquired receptor-binding activity via the mutation D151G, although these isolates also appear to retain the ability to bind receptors via HA. We report here the laboratory generation of a mutation (G147R) that enables an N1 NA to completely co-opt the receptor-binding function normally performed by HA. Viruses with this mutant NA grow to high titers even in the presence of extensive mutations to conserved residues in HA's receptor-binding pocket. When the receptor-binding NA is paired with this binding-deficient HA, viral infectivity and red blood cell agglutination are blocked by NA inhibitors. Furthermore, virus-like particles expressing only the receptor-binding NA agglutinate red blood cells in an NA-dependent manner. Although the G147R NA receptor-binding mutant virus that we characterize is a laboratory creation, this same mutation is found in several natural clusters of H1N1 and H5N1 viruses. Our results demonstrate that, at least in tissue culture, influenza virus receptor-binding activity can be entirely shifted from HA to NA.

"Absence of 'live' residual poliovirus in Inactivated Poliovirus Vaccine (IPV) is routinely checked using Primary Monkey Kidney Cells (PMKC). However, the increasing demand for IPV and the ethical, technical and safety issues associated with the use of non-human primates in research and quality control, has made the replacement of primary cells with an established cell line a priority, in line with the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement in animal testing). As an alternative to PMKC, we evaluated the L20B cell line; a mouse cell-line genetically engineered to express human poliovirus receptor, CD155. L20B is already used for the detection and diagnosis of poliovirus in clinical samples. We demonstrate the stability of L20B cells in terms of CD155 gene and receptor expression, and permissivity to polioviruses for at least 16 sequential passages. In addition, the L20B cell line was found to be at least as sensitive as PMKC in detecting the presence of 'live' poliovirus in IPV samples. Equivalence or superiority of L20B cells versus PMKCs was demonstrated for assessing the presence of residual 'live' poliovirus in formaldehyde-inactivated preparations for the three poliovirus serotypes. These results demonstrate that the L20B cell line is a suitable alternative to PMKC in IPV inactivation testing.

"Nucleoside kinases from several species are investigated as ""suicide genes"" for treatment of malignant tumors by combined gene/chemotherapy. We have recently cloned a multisubstrate deoxyribonucleoside kinase of Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK), and we have shown that the enzyme phosphorylates cytotoxic pyrimidine and purine nucleoside analogs. The broad substrate specificity of the enzyme, as well as its very high catalytic rate, makes it a unique member of the nucleoside kinase enzyme family. In the present study, we evaluated Dm-dNK as a suicide gene by constructing a replication-deficient retroviral vector that expresses the enzyme. The human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2 and a thymidine kinase-deficient osteosarcoma cell line were transduced with the recombinant virus. We showed that Dm-dNK can be expressed in human cells, that the enzyme retained its enzymatic activity, and that it is localized in the cell nuclei due to a nuclear localization signal in its C-terminal region. The cells expressing Dm-dNK exhibited increased sensitivity to several cytotoxic nucleoside analogs, such as 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine, 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylthymine, (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine, 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine, and 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine. These findings suggest that Dm-dNK may be used as a suicide gene in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer.

"Tankyrases 1 and 2, the specialized members of the ARTD protein family, are druggable biotargets whose inhibition may have therapeutic potential against cancer, metabolic disease, fibrotic disease, fibrotic wound healing and HSV viral infections. We have previously identified a novel tankyrase inhibitor scaffold, JW55, and showed that it reduces mouse colon adenoma formation in vivo. Here we expanded the scaffold and profiled the selectivity of the compounds against a panel of human ARTDs. The scaffold also enables a fine modulation of selectivity towards either tankyrase 1 or tankyrase 2. In order to get insight about the binding mode of the inhibitors, we solved crystal structures of the compounds in complex with tankyrase 2. The compounds bind to the adenosine pocket of the catalytic domain and cause changes in the protein structure that are modulated by the chemical modifications of the compounds. The structural analysis allows further rational development of this compound class as a potent and selective tankyrase inhibitor.

"An analysis was made of the neutralizing antibody repertoire, for influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) of transgenic mice expressing a human immunoglobulin mu (IgH) minigene, by monoclonal antibody (MAb) selection and sequencing of the HA genes of X31 (H3N2 subtype) laboratory variants. Whereas previously reported laboratory variants, selected in ovo with high-affinity murine MAbs of the IgG class, differed from wild-type virus by a single amino acid residue change in one of the major antigenic sites, neutralizing MAbs from transgenic donors selected novel variant viruses with altered receptor-binding specificity and contained residue changes in both the receptor-binding pocket (HA1 225 or HA1 226) and an antigenic site (HA1 135, HA1 145, or HA1 158). Changes in receptor-binding specificities of the variant viruses were confirmed by their resistance to inhibition by horse serum glycoproteins and altered binding to neoglycoproteins. The residue changes in variant virus V-21.2 (HA1 135 G-->R, 225 G-->D) abrogated neutralization by each of the MAbs; nevertheless V-21.2 was recognized by its own selecting MAb in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and therefore qualified as an adsorptive mutant rather than an antigenic variant. We consider that a low-affinity neutralizing antibody response may preferentially select for receptor-binding variants of influenza virus HA.

"Granzymes are a family of granule serine proteases found specifically in the cytotoxic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Granzymes have features that are strongly conserved including: consensus sequences at their N-termini and around the three catalytic residues, activation from zymogenic forms, and conserved disulphide bridges. However, there is good genetic evidence to suggest that three distinct subfamilies of granzymes have coevolved. These subfamilies are most strikingly depicted by their distinct chromosomal loci and gene organization, dividing the granzyme family into subfamilies of the following: tryptases (human chromosome 5); chymotrypsin-like proteases (human chromosome 14); and a Metase amongst a cluster of elastase-like proteases (human chromosome 19). Modeling and mutational analysis has revealed that each subfamily of granzymes displays special sequence and structural features and a proteolytic specificity determined by subtle modifications to substrate binding pocket residues. It now remains of great interest to determine whether these subfamilies also possess distinct biological functions. Granzyme B has been shown to play an important role in lymphocyte-mediated target cell apoptosis and the tryptase, granzyme A, has been demonstrated to regulate the clearance of some pox virus infections. The future creation of other granzyme gene knockout mice should elucidate whether other chymotrypsin-like granzymes (C-H) also contribute to target cell apoptosis and whether the third subfamily member, natural killer cell-specific Metase, has a distinct biological function.

"Laboratory inbred mice are used widely and commonly in biomedical research, but inbred mice do not have a big enough gene pool for the research. In this study, genetic and morphometric analyses were performed to obtain data on the characteristics of a newly developing inbred strain (KWM/Hym) captured from Chuncheon, Korea. All of five Korean wild male mice have the zinc-finger Y (ZfY) gene. Also, all of 19 Korean wild mice used in this analysis have the AKV-type murine leukemia virus gene, indicating that Korean wild mice might be Mus musculus musculus. To identify the genetic polymorphism in KWM/Hym, SNP analysis was performed. In a comparison with 28 SNP markers, there was a considerable difference between KWM/Hym and several inbred strains. The homogeneity between KWM/Hym and the inbred strains was as follows: C57BL/6J (39.3%), BALB/c AJic (42.9%), and DBA/2J (50%). KWM/Hym is most similar to the PWK/PhJ inbred strain (96.4%) derived from wild mice (Czech Republic). To identify the morphometric characteristics of KWM/Hym, the external morphology was measured. The tail ratio of male and female was 79.60±3.09 and 73.55±6.14%, respectively. KWM/Hym has short and agouti-colored hairs and its belly is white with golden hair. Taking these results together, KWM/Hym, a newly developing inbred mouse originated from wild mouse, might be use as new genetic resources to overcome the limitations of the current laboratory mice.

"Enteric pathogens from biofertilizer can accumulate in the soil, subsequently contaminating water and crops. We evaluated the survival, percolation and leaching of model enteric pathogens in clay and sandy soils after biofertilization with swine digestate: PhiX-174, mengovirus (vMC(0)), Salmonella enterica Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were used as biomarkers. The survival of vMC(0) and PhiX-174 in clay soil was significantly lower than in sandy soil (iT(90) values of 10.520 ± 0.600 vs. 21.270 ± 1.100 and 12.040 ± 0.010 vs. 43.470 ± 1.300, respectively) and PhiX-174 showed faster percolation and leaching in sandy soil than clay soil (iT(90) values of 0.46 and 2.43, respectively). S. enterica Typhimurium was percolated and inactivated more slowly than E. coli O157:H7 (iT(90) values of 9.340 ± 0.200 vs. 6.620 ± 0.500 and 11.900 ± 0.900 vs. 10.750 ± 0.900 in clay and sandy soils, respectively), such that E. coli O157:H7 was transferred more quickly to the deeper layers of both soils evaluated (percolation). Our findings suggest that E. coli O157:H7 may serve as a useful microbial biomarker of depth contamination and leaching in clay and sandy soil and that bacteriophage could be used as an indicator of enteric pathogen persistence. Our study contributes to development of predictive models for enteric pathogen behavior in soils, and for potential water and food contamination associated with biofertilization, useful for risk management and mitigation in swine digestate recycling.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: New therapies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are urgently needed since current treatments rarely lead to cure. We evaluated whether the oral small molecule toll-like receptor (TLR7) agonist GS-9620 could induce durable antiviral efficacy in woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), a hepadnavirus closely related to human hepatitis B virus (HBV). METHODS: After evaluating the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and tolerability of oral GS-9620 in uninfected woodchucks, adult woodchucks chronically infected with WHV (n = 7 per group) were dosed with GS-9620 or placebo for 4 or 8 weeks with different treatment schedules. RESULTS: GS-9620 treatment induced rapid, marked and sustained reduction in serum viral DNA (mean maximal 6.2log10 reduction), and hepatic WHV DNA replicative intermediates, WHV cccDNA and WHV RNA, as well as loss of detectable serum WHV surface antigen (WHsAg). GS-9620 treatment also induced a sustained antibody response against WHsAg in a subset of animals. Strikingly, treatment reduced the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from 71% in the placebo group to 8% in GS-9620-treated woodchucks with sustained viral load reduction. GS-9620 treatment was associated with reversible increases in serum liver enzymes and thrombocytopenia, and induced intrahepatic CD8(+) T cell, NK cell, B cell and interferon response transcriptional signatures. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that short duration, finite treatment with the oral TLR7 agonist GS-9620 can induce a sustained antiviral response in the woodchuck model of CHB, and support investigation of this compound as a therapeutic approach to attain a functional cure in CHB patients.

"The TRAF [tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor] family of cytoplasmic adaptor proteins link cell-surface receptors to intracellular signaling pathways that regulate innate and adaptive immune responses. In response to activation of RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I), a component of a pattern recognition receptor that detects viruses, TRAF3 binds to the adaptor protein Cardif [caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) adaptor-inducing interferon-β (IFN-β)], leading to induction of type I IFNs. We report the crystal structures of the TRAF domain of TRAF5 and that of TRAF3 bound to a peptide from the TRAF-interacting motif of Cardif. By comparing these structures, we identified two residues located near the Cardif binding pocket in TRAF3 (Tyr(440) and Phe(473)) that potentially contributed to Cardif recognition. In vitro and cellular experiments showed that forms of TRAF5 with mutation of the corresponding residues to those of TRAF3 had TRAF3-like antiviral activity. Our results provide a structural basis for the critical role of TRAF3 in activating RIG-I-mediated IFN production.

"The rabbit flea Caenopsylla laptevi ibera occurs in arid environments of central and eastern Spain. Although the fleas breed during the coolest, most humid part of the year, the larvae survive and grow in sand at only 50-60% relative humidity. At 22 degrees C and 80% relative humidity eggs hatch in six days and the cocoon stage is reached 10-11 days after hatching. Female fleas emerge from pupation at about 17 days after cocoon spinning; males emerge a little later at a mean of 20 days. Adult fleas are mainly found on the host Oryctolagus cuniculus. Measurements of burrow microclimate confirmed that in south-eastern Spain burrow humidity was adequate for the development of C. I. ibera larvae over most of the year. However, breeding may be restricted for at least part of the year, as the larvae of C. I. ibera apparently cannot complete development at 25 degrees C or above. In the laboratory, fleas can enter a prolonged quiescent period while in the cocoon. This is possibly a facultative, pre-pupal diapause and the likely mechanism that accounts for the disappearance of adult fleas from the field by spring and their reappearance each autumn.

"Reovirus serotype 3 Dearing (T3D) has shown potential as a novel cancer therapy. To support the increasing demand for reovirus, a two-stage perfusion mode scheme is proposed for cell growth and reovirus production. Mouse L-929 cells were used as the host for reovirus infection due to their ability to grow well in suspension culture. Several L-929 cell growth and reovirus infection characteristics were investigated and optimized in spinner flask batch cultures. For the growth of L-929 cells, a balanced nutrient-fortification of SMEM medium increased the maximum cell density by 30%, compared to normal SMEM; however, ammonia and lactate accumulations were found to inhibit further cell growth. For the production of reovirus, approximately 90% increase in viral yield resulted when the infection temperature was reduced from 37 to 33 degrees C. Infectious reovirus particles were shown to be stable in conditioned medium at 37 and 33 degrees C. The final virus titer was dependent on the multiplicity of infection (MOI) and the host cell density at the time of infection. A combination of an MOI of 0.1 pfu/cell and an initial host cell density of 1.0 x 10(6) cells/mL in fortified medium resulted in a maximum virus titer of (4.59 +/- 0.16) x 10(9) pfu/mL and a specific yield of (2.34 +/- 0.08) x 10(3) pfu/cell. At an optimal harvest time of the infection process, 99% of the virus was associated with the cellular debris. Finally, the presence of 5.0 mM ammonia in the culture medium was shown to seriously inhibit the reovirus yield, whereas lactate concentrations up to 20 mM had no effect.

"BACKGROUND: Rubella is usually a mild viral illness, but during pregnancy, it can have potentially devastating effects causing fetal losses and severe congenital malformations (congenital rubella syndrome). Rubella is now rare in most developed countries following a successful vaccination programme. We aimed to investigate differences in epidemiological profile of pregnant women screened antenatally in Liverpool to identify risk factors for rubella immunity. METHODS: All samples were tested with the Elecsys Rubella IgG immunoassay kit. A result <10 IU/ml was considered to be seronegative. RESULTS: The seronegativity prevalence among pregnant women in Liverpool (6.3%) is higher than average value for the North West region (3.7%). The seronegative rates varied with age (15.4% for <15 years, 18.7% for 15-20 years, compared with 2% for 30-35 years). The areas with the highest seronegative rates correspond with areas of Liverpool with high pockets of socioeconomic deprivation. CONCLUSION: The highest proportion of seronegative women were among the youngest age groups. Local areas with highest level of deprivation should be given priority and additional resources to develop targeted programmes and pathways to implement appropriate interventions such as MMR catch-up programmes and put in place arrangements for offering MMR vaccination in maternity units.

"Swimming in fecally contaminated recreational water may lead to gastrointestinal illness. A recreational water-associated outbreak of norovirus (NoV) infections affecting at least 100 people in The Netherlands occurred in August 2012. Questionnaire responses from patients indicated swimming in recreational lake Zeumeren as the most likely cause of illness. Most patients visited the lake during the weekend of 18⁻19 August, during which the weather was exceptionally warm (maximum temperatures 32⁻33 °C), and visitor numbers elevated. Patients, mostly children, became ill with gastroenteritis 1⁻6 days (median 2 days) after exposure. Four stool samples from patients were NoV GI positive. Subsurface sandy soil from one of the beaches where most patients swam was NoV GI positive; the water sample was negative. The epidemiological curve and the timeline of investigation based on reported symptoms demonstrate the difficulty in discovering the source in recreational water outbreaks. A NoV outbreak in a recreational lake that is not subjected to external fecal contamination sources shows the need for active communication about human shedding of viruses during and after diarrheal episodes and the advice to refrain from swimming, even a few weeks after the symptoms have resolved.

"We have defined 40 endogenous xenotropic virus (Xmv) loci from several common inbred strains of mice by examining provirus-cell DNA junction fragments in recombinant inbred mice. Some inbred strains carried unique proviruses, but most Xmv loci were present in several strains, indicating that many Xmv integration events preexisted modern inbreeding. It was also clear that most Xmv junction fragment variation between inbred strains resulted from independent integration events and not modification or restriction site polymorphism following integration. Chromosomal assignments were determined for 32 Xmv loci by comparing their recombinant inbred strain distribution patterns to those of known genetic markers. The Xmv loci were generally dispersed throughout the genome, but several chromosomal regions contained more than one provirus. Furthermore, several close genetic associations with cellular genes were discovered. Four Xmv loci were closely linked to Fv-1b, a dominant viral resistance gene present in C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, A/J, and several other strains. Xmv-28 was closely linked to rd (retinal degeneration), and Xmv-10 was closely linked to a (non-agouti), both of which are old mutations as inferred from their broad distribution in mice. We suggest that Xmv integration contributed to genetic diversity in the past and that much of this diversity exists today in common laboratory strains.

"A recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-PeGFP-M-MmRFP) encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein fused in frame with P (PeGFP) in place of P and a fusion matrix protein (monomeric red fluorescent protein fused in frame at the carboxy terminus of M [MmRFP]) at the G-L gene junction, in addition to wild-type (wt) M protein in its normal location, was recovered, but the MmRFP was not incorporated into the virions. Subsequently, we generated recombinant viruses (VSV-PeGFP-DeltaM-Mtc and VSV-DeltaM-Mtc) encoding M protein with a carboxy-terminal tetracysteine tag (Mtc) in place of the M protein. These recombinant viruses incorporated Mtc at levels similar to M in wt VSV, demonstrating recovery of infectious rhabdoviruses encoding and incorporating a tagged M protein. Virions released from cells infected with VSV-PeGFP-DeltaM-Mtc and labeled with the biarsenical red dye (ReAsH) were dually fluorescent, fluorescing green due to incorporation of PeGFP in the nucleocapsids and red due to incorporation of ReAsH-labeled Mtc in the viral envelope. Transport and subsequent association of M protein with the plasma membrane were shown to be independent of microtubules. Sequential labeling of VSV-DeltaM-Mtc-infected cells with the biarsenical dyes ReAsH and FlAsH (green) revealed that newly synthesized M protein reaches the plasma membrane in less than 30 min and continues to accumulate there for up to 2 1/2 hours. Using dually fluorescent VSV, we determined that following adsorption at the plasma membrane, the time taken by one-half of the virus particles to enter cells and to uncoat their nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm is approximately 28 min.

"As Covid-19 spreads across the world, governments turn a hopeful eye towards research and development of a vaccine against this new disease. But it is one thing to make a vaccine available, and it is quite another to convince the public to take the shot, as the precedent of the 2009 H1N1 influenza illustrated. In this paper, we present the results of four online surveys conducted in April 2020 in representative samples of the French population 18 years of age and over (N = 5018). These surveys were conducted during a period when the French population was on lockdown and the daily number of deaths attributed to the virus reached its peak. We found that if a vaccine against the new coronavirus became available, almost a quarter of respondents would not use it. We also found that attitudes to this vaccine were correlated significantly with political partisanship and engagement with the political system. Attitudes towards this future vaccine did not follow the traditional mapping of political attitudes along a Left-Right axis. The rift seems to be between people who feel close to governing parties (Centre, Left and Right) on the one hand, and, on the other, people who feel close to Far-Left and Far-Right parties as well as people who do not feel close to any party. We draw on the French sociological literature on ordinary attitudes to politics to discuss our results as well as the cultural pathways via which political beliefs can affect perceptions of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"OBJECTIVE: To describe perception and knowledge of hepatitis C infection, related care and treatment, among women included in the Manif 2000 cohort, a study that enrolled patients HIV-infected through intravenous drug use (IVDU). METHOD: A qualitative survey among women who had been pregnant, conducted in the form of semi-direct interviews, between October 2000 and March 2001, in the PACA area (South Eastern) of France. Twenty-two out of the 32 eligible women agreed to participate. RESULTS: 21/22 women were HCV co-infected. In 13 cases, HCV screening was done during HIV infection follow-up. Although, for interviewed women, hepatitis C infection was of minor importance compared with HIV infection, the majority of them considered that they were well informed on HCV infection and its risks. Nevertheless, four women declared regular alcohol consumption and 8 women did not know how HCV was transmitted. None of them mentioned the risk of vertical transmission of the virus. For these women, their physician in charge of HIV was the master piece in the care of HCV infection and the main provider of information about this disease. Liver biopsy was offered to 11 women (9 agreed). Three women had already been treated for their HCV infection and 5 others were about to start treatment. CONCLUSION: With the improvement in life span of HIV-infected persons, the protection of liver functions has become an important medical challenge. It is of particular importance that the physicians in charge of HIV should provide more counselling to IVDU or ex-IVDU patients, in order to increase their awareness on the risks related to co-infections, the use of drugs and consumption of alcohol.

"Catastrophic weather, like a pandemic, can wreak havoc on hospital operations. NYU Langone Health in New York City has experienced the extremes of both phenomena. In 2012, Superstorm Sandy severely damaged the system's core facilities, disabled operations, and forced the evacuation of more than 220 patients to other health systems. In 2020, the arrival of the novel coronavirus severely disrupted operations again-but this time, we were better prepared. Our experience in dealing with Superstorm Sandy taught us critical lessons that supported our readiness for COVID-19. Those lessons can be summed up as preparation, organization, and innovation.

"The highest annual incidence of human tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Sweden ever recorded by the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control (SMI) occurred last year, 2011. The number of TBE cases recorded during 2012 up to 6th August 2012 indicates that the incidence for 2012 could exceed that of 2011. In this review of the ecology and epidemiology of TBE in Sweden our main aim is to analyse the possible reasons behind the gradually increasing incidence of human TBE during the last 20 years. The main TBE virus (TBEV) vector to humans in Sweden is the nymphal stage of the common tick Ixodes ricinus. The main mode of transmission and maintenance of TBEV in the tick population is considered to be when infective nymphs co-feed with uninfected but infectible larvae on rodents. In most locations the roe deer, Capreolus capreolus is the main host for the reproducing adult I. ricinus ticks. The high number of roe deer for more than three decades has resulted in a very large tick population. Deer numbers have, however, gradually declined from the early 1990s to the present. This decline in roe deer numbers most likely made the populations of small rodents, which are reservoir-competent for TBEV, gradually more important as hosts for the immature ticks. Consequently, the abundance of TBEV-infected ticks has increased. Two harsh winters in 2009-2011 caused a more abrupt decline in roe deer numbers. This likely forced a substantial proportion of the ""host-seeking"" ticks to feed on bank voles (Myodes glareolus), which at that time suddenly had become very numerous, rather than on roe deer. Thus, the bank vole population peak in 2010 most likely caused many tick larvae to feed on reservoir-competent rodents. This presumably resulted in increased transmission of TBEV among ticks and therefore increased the density of infected ticks the following year. The unusually warm, humid weather and the prolonged vegetation period in 2011 permitted nymphs and adult ticks to quest for hosts nearly all days of that year. These weather conditions stimulated many people to spend time outdoors in areas where they were at risk of being attacked by infective nymphs. This resulted in at least 284 human cases of overt TBE. The tick season of 2012 also started early with an exceptionally warm March. The abundance of TBEV-infective ""hungry"" ticks was presumably still relatively high. Precipitation during June and July was rich and will lead to a ""good mushroom season"". These factors together are likely to result in a TBE incidence of 2012 similar to or higher than that of 2011.

"The present study described the kinetics of Rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) infection in newborn rats by monitoring infectious virus and viral antigens in various organs, viral DNA in the blood (DNAemia) and antibody response. These parameters were evaluated quantitatively using double-antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA), real-time PCR, indirect ELISA and virus infectivity assay. For the first time DAS-ELISA was used for detection of RCMV antigen directly from organ samples. The relationships between the presence of viral antigens in the infected organs and antibody levels were established by the Spearman's rank test. It was found that the virus was present in the blood, spleen, liver, lungs, and kidneys earlier than in the salivary glands. Furthermore, the early immunity of the newborn rats led to a delayed seroconversion. We suggested that the prolonged presence of the virus in salivary glands could augment the antibody response that conversely might be responsible for a reduction of viremia. This study expanded our understanding of RCMV pathogenesis leading to improved therapeutic and preventive treatment regimens particularly for the neonatal Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections. Additionally, the detection procedures developed in this study such as DAS-ELISA and real-time PCR could serve as alternative techniques for rapid screening of large number of samples.

"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) disease caused more than 100,000,000 people get infected and over 2,200,000 people being killed worldwide. However, the current developed vaccines or drugs may be not effective in preventing the pandemic of COVID-19 due to the mutations of coronavirus and the severe side effects of the newly developed vaccines. Chinese herbal medicines and their active components play important antiviral activities. Corilagin exhibited antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). However, whether it blocks the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and hACE2 has not been elucidated. PURPOSE: To characterize an active compound, corilagin derived from Phyllanthus urinaria as potential SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors for its possible preventive application in daily anti-virus hygienic products. METHODS: Computational docking coupled with bio-layer interferometry, BLI were adopted to screen more than 1800 natural compounds for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD inhibitors. Corilagin was confirmed to have a strong binding affinity with SARS-CoV-2-RBD or human ACE2 (hACE2) protein by the BLI, ELISA and immunocytochemistry (ICC) assay. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of viral infection of corilagin was assessed by in vitro pseudovirus system. Finally, the toxicity of corilagin was examined by using MTT assay and maximal tolerated dose (MTD) studies in C57BL/6 mice. RESULTS: Corilagin preferentially binds to a pocket that contains residues Cys 336 to Phe 374 of spike-RBD with a relatively low binding energy of -9.4 kcal/mol. BLI assay further confirmed that corilagin exhibits a relatively strong binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2-RBD and hACE2 protein. In addition, corilagin dose-dependently blocks SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding and abolishes the infectious property of RBD-pseudotyped lentivirus in hACE2 overexpressing HEK293 cells, which mimicked the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus in human host cells. Finally, in vivo studies revealed that up to 300 mg/kg/day of corilagin was safe in C57BL/6 mice. Our findings suggest that corilagin could be a safe and potential antiviral agent against the COVID-19 acting through the blockade of the fusion of SARS-CoV-2 spike-RBD to hACE2 receptors. CONCLUSION: Corilagin could be considered as a safe and environmental friendly anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for its potential preventive application in daily anti-virus hygienic products.

"The natural history of infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) has been studied in a colony of 38 Marmota monax. Besides serologic assessment for WHV markers, light-microscopic findings of 61 liver biopsies were correlated with the results of immunofluorescence analysis for nucleocapsid (WHcAg) and surface (WHsAg) antigens. Twenty-four chronic WHsAg carriers all featured signs of continuous viral replication. Two major immunomorphologic patterns were observed in their livers: 1) portal hepatitis in which WHcAg accumulated in the cytoplasm and WHsAg was associated with the hepatocyte membrane and 2) periportal hepatitis in which WHcAg shifted toward nuclear localization and WHsAg became mostly intracytoplasmic. Progression from portal to periportal hepatitis, observed in 7 woodchucks, appeared to be induced by a partial recovery of specific immune reactivity to WHV, insufficient, however, to interrupt WHV replication. Deposits of WHsAg and immunoglobulins were present in the kidney and spleen of animals with severe hepatitis.

"Neuronal chains between the retina and the pineal body were investigated. Transneuronal tracers, retrograde spreading pseudorabies virus (labeled with green fluorescent protein, memGreen-RV) and virus spreading in both ante- and retrograde directions (labeled with red fluorescent protein, Ka-VHS-mCherry-A-RV) were injected into the right eye of vitreous body of intact or bilaterally sympathectomized Wistar male rats. Intact golden hamsters also received memGreen-RV into the eye and Ka-VHS-mCherry-A-RV into the pineal body. Four-five days later the animals were sacrificed. Frozen sections were prepared from the removed structures. In intact rats memGreen-RV resulted in green fluorescent labeling in the trigeminal and the superior cervical ganglia, the lateral horn of the spinal cord, the paraventricular and the suprachiasmatic nuclei, the perifornical region, the ventrolateral medulla, the locus ceruleus, and the raphe nuclei. In sympathectomized rats the labeling was missing from the brainstem but further existed in the hypothalamus. This observation indicates that the hypothalamic labeling is not mediated by the sympathetic system. One labeled neuron in the pineal body was only observed in 2/13 rats. It was independent from the sympathectomy. When the animals received Ka-VHS-mCherry-A-RV the distribution of the labeling was very similar to that of the intact group receiving retrograde virus. In golden hamsters the memGreen-RV labeled structures were seen in similar places as in rats, but virus labeled nerve cell bodies were always seen in the pineal body. Injection of Ka-VHS-mCherry-A-RV into the pineal body of hamsters resulted in labeling of the retina at both sides. It was concluded that the retinopetal neuronal chain in golden hamsters is always present but in rats it is stochastic.

"Phthalocyanines are useful sensitizers for the photodynamic sterilization of red blood cell concentrates. The mechanism of photoinactivation of lipid-enveloped viruses is not completely understood. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was used as a model virus to study the primary targets of photoinactivation by aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (AIPcS4) or silicon phthalocyanine HOSiPcOSi(CH3)2(CH2)3N(CH3)2 (Pc4) and red light. Inactivation conditions for VSV in buffer were determined using an end point dilution assay, and viral RNA synthesis in host cells was measured to determine the loss of infectivity in a direct way. The very rapid decrease in the viral RNA synthesis after photodynamic treatment was correlated with respect to different potential primary targets that are involved in different steps of the viral replication cycle. Damage to the viral proteins, induced by treatment with AIPcS4 or Pc4 and analyzed by gel electrophoresis, could not account for the observed loss of infectivity. Binding of VSV to host cells was only slightly impaired after photodynamic treatment with both sensitizers and could therefore not be responsible for the rapid decrease in viral RNA synthesis in cells. A very strong inhibition of viral RNA polymerase activity after treatment with AIPcS4 and red light was detectable using an in vitro assay. This decrease correlated well with the loss of infectivity, indicating that either the RNA or the viral RNA polymerase is the primary target for photoinactivation of VSV with AIPcS4. Treatment with Pc4 did not cause inhibition of viral RNA polymerase activity to an extent that could account for the observed very rapid loss of infectivity. It was therefore concluded that neither the viral proteins nor the binding to the host cells nor the RNA or RNA polymerase are the primary targets for photoinactivation of VSV by Pc4.

"Despite their high clinical and socioeconomic impacts, there is currently no approved antiviral therapy for the prophylaxis or treatment of enterovirus infections. Here we report on a novel inhibitor of enterovirus replication, compound 1, 2-fluoro-4-(2-methyl-8-(3-(methylsulfonyl)benzylamino)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl)phenol. This compound exhibited a broad spectrum of antiviral activity, as it inhibited all tested species of enteroviruses and rhinoviruses, with 50% effective concentrations ranging between 4 and 71 nM. After a lengthy resistance selection process, coxsackievirus mutants resistant to compound 1 were isolated that carried substitutions in their 3A protein. Remarkably, the same substitutions were recently shown to provide resistance to inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ), a lipid kinase that is essential for enterovirus replication, suggesting that compound 1 may also target this host factor. Accordingly, compound 1 directly inhibited PI4KIIIβ in an in vitro kinase activity assay. Furthermore, the compound strongly reduced the PI 4-phosphate levels of the Golgi complex in cells. Rescue of coxsackievirus replication in the presence of compound 1 by a mutant PI4KIIIβ carrying a substitution in its ATP-binding pocket revealed that the compound directly binds the kinase at this site. Finally, we determined that an analogue of compound 1, 3-(3-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-methyl-N-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine, is well tolerated in mice and has a dose-dependent protective activity in a coxsackievirus serotype B4-induced pancreatitis model.

"Crucial aspects of the foamy virus (FV) replication strategy have so far only been investigated for the prototypic FV (PFV) isolate, which is supposed to be derived from nonhuman primates. To study whether the unusual features of this replication pathway also apply to more-distantly related FVs, we constructed feline FV (FFV) infectious molecular clones and vectors. It is shown by quantitative RNA and DNA PCR analysis that FFV virions contain more RNA than DNA. Full-length linear DNA was found in extracellular FFV by Southern blot analysis. Similar to PFV, azidothymidine inhibition experiments and the transfection of nucleic acids extracted from extracellular FFV indicated that DNA is the functional relevant FFV genome. Unlike PFV, no evidence was found indicating that FFV recycles its DNA into the nucleus.

"BACKGROUND: The hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein is the principal target of protective humoral immune responses to influenza virus infections but such antibody responses only provide efficient protection against a narrow spectrum of HA antigenic variants within a given virus subtype. Avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 are currently panzootic and pose a pandemic threat. These viruses are antigenically diverse and protective strategies need to cross protect against diverse viral clades. Furthermore, there are 16 different HA subtypes and no certainty the next pandemic will be caused by an H5 subtype, thus it is important to develop prophylactic and therapeutic interventions that provide heterosubtypic protection. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Here we describe a panel of 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) recovered from combinatorial display libraries that were constructed from human IgM(+) memory B cells of recent (seasonal) influenza vaccinees. The mAbs have broad heterosubtypic neutralizing activity against antigenically diverse H1, H2, H5, H6, H8 and H9 influenza subtypes. Restriction to variable heavy chain gene IGHV1-69 in the high affinity mAb panel was associated with binding to a conserved hydrophobic pocket in the stem domain of HA. The most potent antibody (CR6261) was protective in mice when given before and after lethal H5N1 or H1N1 challenge. CONCLUSIONS: The human monoclonal CR6261 described in this study could be developed for use as a broad spectrum agent for prophylaxis or treatment of human or avian influenza infections without prior strain characterization. Moreover, the CR6261 epitope could be applied in targeted vaccine strategies or in the design of novel antivirals. Finally our approach of screening the IgM(+) memory repertoire could be applied to identify conserved and functionally relevant targets on other rapidly evolving pathogens.

"Nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks were collected from several sites in Rhode Island. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were used to determine the presence and prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum human agent (AP-ha) and a genetic variant not associated with human disease (AP-variant 1). The remaining ticks from each cohort were allowed to feed to repletion on either white-footed (Peromyscus leucopus) or DBA/2 (Mus musculus) mice. The engorged ticks and murine blood samples were evaluated for the presence of AP-ha and AP-variant 1. Although a high percentage of the infecting ticks harbored AP-variant 1, only AP-ha was amplified from the murine blood samples. Additional ticks were fed on immunocompromised SCID mice, and, again, only AP-ha was capable of establishing an infection, and only AP-ha could be detected by xenodiagnosis. These data suggest that AP-variant 1 cannot establish an infection in mice, and we propose that AP-variant 1 has an alternative natural reservoir, possibly white-tailed deer.

"Rodent species like Myodes glareolus and Microtus spp. are natural reservoirs for many zoonotic pathogens causing human diseases and are gaining increasing interest in the field of eco-immunology as candidate animal models. Despite their importance the lack of immunological reagents has hampered research in these animal species. Here we report the recombinant production and functional characterization of IFN-γ, a central mediator of host's innate and adaptive immune responses, from the bank vole M. glareolus. Soluble dimeric recMgIFN-γ was purified in high yield from Escherichia coli. Its activity on M. glareolus and Microtus arvalis kidney cell lines was assessed by immunofluorescent detection of nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT1. RecMgIFN-γ also induced expression of an IFN-γ-regulated innate immunity gene. Inhibition of vesicular stomatitis virus replication in vole cells upon recMgIFN-γ treatment provided further evidence of its biological activity. Finally, we established a recMgIFN-γ-responsive bank vole reporter cell line that allows the sensitive titration of the cytokine activity via a bioluminescence reporter assay. Taken together, we report valuable tools for future investigations on the immune response against zoonotic pathogens in their natural animal hosts, which might foster the development of novel animal models.

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recently influenza pandemic outbreaks were caused by emerging H5N1, H7N9 and H1N1 viruses. However, virucidal disinfectants are mainly unspecific and toxic. It is tactical to discover specific virucidal compounds. METHODS: The inhibitory potency was determined in H5N1 pseudovirus system; Interactions of compounds with hemagglutinin (HA) were detected with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and further calculated with molecular docking. Virucidal effect was also estimated in influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1). Prevention efficacy was further estimated in mice model. RESULTS: Oligothiophene compound 4sc was potently virucidal against H5N1 pseudovirus with selective index>1169 (IC(50)=0.17±0.01μM). Pseudovirus assay revealed 4sc may interact with HA. However, HA inhibition test indicated 4sc did not interact with receptor pocket in HA. SPR detection revealed 4sc interacted directly with HA and its HA2 subunits. Molecular docking analysis revealed that 4sc interacted with the cavity of HA2 stem region and HA1-HA2 interface which consist of 7 residues: L2(2), K26(2), G47(2) and F110(2) in HA2; M24(1), E25(1) and N27(1) in HA1. 4sc also potently and irreversibly neutralized PR8 (H1N1) virus, causing 10(5.06±0.26) fold decrease of virus titer after exposure for 10min. 4sc blocked PR8 transmission to MDCK cells. Amazingly, virucidal effect of 4sc was not significantly reduced even at 4°C. Furthermore, 4sc blocked viral transmission to mice. CONCLUSION: Oligothiophene compound 4sc is a novel selective virucide of influenza virus, which blocks entry by interfering viral hemagglutinin. Due to promising safety profile and stable virucidal effect at 4°C, 4sc may be useful in disinfecting H5N1 and H1N1 influenza virus.

"Among cells of the immune system, CD11c(+) and DEC-205(+) splenic dendritic cells primarily express the cellular receptor (alpha-dystroglycan [alpha-DG]) for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). By selection, strains and variants of LCMV that bind alpha-DG with high affinity are associated with virus replication in the white pulp, show preferential replication in a majority of CD11c(+) and DEC-205(+) cells, cause immunosuppression, and establish a persistent infection. In contrast, viral strains and variants that bind with low affinity to alpha-DG are associated with viral replication in the red pulp, display minimal replication in CD11c(+) and DEC-205(+) cells, and generate a robust anti-LCMV cytotoxic T lymphocyte response that clears the virus infection. Differences in binding affinities can be mapped to a single amino acid change in the viral glycoprotein 1 ligand that binds to alpha-DG. These findings indicate that receptor-virus interaction on dendritic cells in vivo can be an essential step in the initiation of virus-induced immunosuppression and viral persistence.

"BACKGROUND: Five cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) infections were attributed to infusion of contaminated blood components, turning to real the interhuman transmissibility of this prion disease from asymptomatic carriers. Preventive policies rely on exclusion from blood donation and benefit of leukoreduction initially implemented against leukotropic viruses. In the absence of available antemortem diagnostic tests, the updated prevalence of silent vCJD infections (1/2000 in the United Kingdom) urges the necessity to enforce blood safety with more efficient active measures able to remove the remaining infectivity. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Several affinity resins were demonstrated to reduce high levels of brain-spiked infectivity from human leukoreduced red blood cells (L-RBCs). One was integrated in a device adapted to field constraints (volumes, duration) of human transfusion. We assessed here the ability of the resulting removal filter, termed P-Capt, to remove infectivity from human L-RBC units spiked with scrapie-infected hamster brain (≥10,000 infectious units/mL), through inoculation of hamsters with pre- and post-blood filtration samples. RESULTS: Incubation periods of recipient animals suggest around a 3-log removal of brain-derived prion infectivity by filtration through the P-Capt. CONCLUSION: On brain-derived spiked infectivity, the P-Capt filter provided a performance similar to the resin packed in columns used for initial proof-of-concept studies, suggesting an appropriate scale-up to efficiently remove infectivity from an individual human blood bag. According to the ability of resin to completely remove apparent endogenous infectivity from hamster leukoreduced blood, the implementation of such a filter, now commercially available, might seriously improve blood safety toward prions.

"The development of genetically marked animal tumour xenografts is an area of ongoing research to enable easier and more reliable testing of cancer therapies. Genetically marked tumour models have a number of advantages over conventional tumour models, including the easy longitudinal monitoring of therapies and the reduced number of animals needed for trials. Several different methods have been used in previous studies to mark tumours genetically, however all have limitations, such as genotoxicity and other artifacts related to the usage of integrating viral vectors. Recently, we have generated an episomally maintained plasmid DNA (pDNA) expression system based on Scaffold/Matrix Attachment Region (S/MAR), which permits long-term luciferase transgene expression in the mouse liver. Here we describe a further usage of this pDNA vector with the human Ubiquitin C promoter to create stably transfected human hepatoma (Huh7) and human Pancreatic Carcinoma (MIA-PaCa2) cell lines, which were delivered into ""immune deficient"" mice and monitored longitudinally over time using a bioluminometer. Both cell lines revealed sustained episomal long-term luciferase expression and formation of a tumour showing the pathological characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pancreatic carcinoma (PaCa), respectively. This is the first demonstration that a pDNA vector can confer sustained episomal luciferase transgene expression in various mouse tumour models and can thus be readily utilised to follow tumour formation without interfering with the cellular genome.

"BACKGROUND: Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease widely present in tropical and subtropical areas. Strongyloides stercoralis represents the main species that infects human beings. Ivermectin is the current drug of choice; however, issues related with treatment failure in patients with diabetes or infected with T-lymphotropic virus-1 make the identification of new molecules for alternative treatment a priority. In the present study, the activity of sphingosine-related aminoalcohol and diamine were evaluated against Strongyloides venezuelensis third-stage larva (L3) cultures and experimental infections in mice. METHODS: The efficacy of each compound against L3 was assessed using both XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assay and microscopic observation with concentrations ranging from 1 to 350 μM. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using J774.2 macrophage cell line and XTT assay. Lethal concentration 50 (LC50), selectivity index (SI) and structure-activity relationships were established. The activity compounds 4 (2-(ethylamino) hexadecan-1-ol), 6 (2-(butylamino) hexadecan-1-ol), 17 (tert-butyl N-(1-aminododecan-2-yl) carbamate) and 18 (tert-butyl N-(1-aminohexadecan-2-yl) carbamate) were further assessed against experimental S. venezuelensis infections in CD1 mice measuring reductions in the numbers of parthenogenetic females and egg passed in faeces. Mice were infected with 3,000 L3 and treated with 20 mg/kg/day for five days. RESULTS: In the screening study of 15 aminoalcohols [lauryl (n = 9); palmityl (n = 13); stearyl (n = 15) and alcohol derivatives], the presence of a palmitol chain was associated with the highest efficacy against L3 (LC50 31.9-39.1 μM). Alkylation of the 2-amino group with medium size fragments as ethyl or n-butyl showed the best larvicidal activity. The dialkylation did not improve efficacy. Aminoalcohols 4 and 6 showed the highest SI (1.5 and 1.6, respectively). With respect to diamine derivative compounds, a chain size of sixteen carbon atoms (palmitoyl chain, n = 13), and the alkylation of the 2-amino group with medium-sized fragments, were associated with the highest lethal activities. The presence of carbamoyl group in diamines 17 and 18 yielded high SI (1.7 and 1.4, respectively). Infected mice treated with aminoalcohol 6 showed reduction in parthenogenetic females (59 %) and eggs in faeces (51 %). CONCLUSIONS: These results support the potentiality of aminoalcohol and diamine sphingosine-related compounds as suitable prototypes for developing new promising drugs against strongyloidiasis.

"Eighty-three wild mammals of ten species were inoculated with a first mouse passage level Venezuelan encephalitis (VE) virus isolated from south Texas in 1971 during the VE outbreak. Rodents were highly susceptible to VE infection and circulated VE virus at levels ranging from 10(7.7) to 10(11.5) suckling mouse intracranial lethal doses per ml for 2 to 4 days. These levels of virus could easily infect vector mosquitoes. Mortality was high in all species of rodents except Sigmodon hispidus, adult Neotoma micropus, and adult Peromyscus leucopus. Lagomorphs were susceptible to VE infection but circulated VE virus at or near mosquito threshold levels for 1 day only. Raccoons and opossums were relatively resistant to VE infection or circulated low levels of virus in the blood. Juvenile animals of four species were more susceptible and experienced higher viremias than did adults. In two of the four, mortality was higher in the juveniles than in adults. A consideration of results obtained during this study and those of other investigators led to the conclusion that equines were of major importance, that canines, lagomorphs and rodents were of minor importance, and that other species tested were of no importance as virus amplifiers in VE epizootics.

"Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase Epsilon (IKKϵ) is an IKK-related kinase. Despite it was originally discovered as a kinase functionally related to TBK-1, studies entailing gene knockout mouse demonstrated that IKKϵ is dispensable for interferon induction by viral infection. In this study, we report that IKKϵ directly phosphorylates a key serine residue within the RNA-binding domain of RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene 1) to inhibit RIG-I-mediate innate immune signaling. Using IKKϵ-deficient MEFs, we found that loss of IKKϵ resulted in increased cytokine production in response to the activation of cytosolic sensors. Biochemical analyses indicated that IKKϵ physically associated with and phosphorylated RIG-I. Mass spectrometry analysis identified that IKKϵ phosphorylated the serine 855 of the RNA-binding pocket of RIG-I carboxyl terminal domain, a residues known to impinge on RNA-binding via phosphorylation. Our findings collectively support the conclusion that IKKϵ modulates innate immune signaling cascades via phosphorylating the RIG-I cytosolic sensor, providing a feedback regulatory mechanism.

"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) has emerged as one of the most potent agents for anti-tumor immunotherapy. However, potentially lethal toxicity associated with systemic administration of IL-12 precludes its clinical application. Here we redesign the molecule in such a way that its anti-tumor efficacy is not compromised, but toxic effects are eliminated. Deletion of the N-terminal signal peptide of IL-12 can effect such a change by preventing IL-12 secretion from cells. We use a newly designed tumor-targeted oncolytic adenovirus (Ad-TD) to deliver non-secreting (ns) IL-12 to tumor cells and examine the therapeutic and toxic effects in Syrian hamster models of pancreatic cancer (PaCa). Strikingly, intraperitoneal delivery of Ad-TD-nsIL-12 significantly enhanced survival of animals with orthotopic PaCa and cured peritoneally disseminated PaCa with no toxic side effects, in contrast to the treatment with Ad-TD expressing unmodified IL-12. These findings offer renewed hope for development of IL-12-based treatments for cancer.

"Flavivirus proteins are produced by co- and post-translational proteolytic processing of a large polyprotein using both host- and virus-encoded enzymes. The flavivirus serine proteinase, which consists of NS2B and NS3, is responsible for cleavages of at least four dibasic sites in the nonstructural region. In this study, a number of substitutions for the conserved amino acids flanking the 3/4A and 4B/5 dibasic cleavage sites [Arg(P2)-Arg(P1) decreases Gly(P1')] were examined for their effects on yellow fever virus (YF) polyprotein processing. The substrate for these studies was a truncated YF polyprotein, called sig2A-5(356), which consists of a signal sequence fused to NS2A and extending through the first 356 amino acids of NS5. At the P1' position (Gly) of the 4B/5 site, only Ser and Ala were allowed while six other substitutions abolished cleavage. Substitutions of the 4B/5 P1 Arg residue with Lys, Gln, Asn, or His were tolerated while replacement with Glu eliminated cleavage. The 4B/5 P2 position (Arg) was found to be tolerant of substitutions with polar or hydrophobic residues which allowed varying degrees of partial cleavage. Previous studies have shown that cleavage at the 3/4A site is incomplete in YF-infected cells and that the cleavage efficiency at this site is significantly less for the sig2A-5(356) polyprotein. Replacement of the 3/4A P1 Arg residue with noncharged polar or hydrophobic residues reduced the cleavage efficiency, whereas substitutions with Glu or Pro abolished cleavage. Studies with polyproteins containing one or both of the 3/4A and 4B/5 cleavage sites blocked indicate that there is not an obligatory processing order for cleavages generating the N termini of YF NS4A, NS4B, and NS5.

"The transfer of maternal antibodies from mother to progeny is a well-known phenomenon in avian and mammalian species. Optimally, they protect the newborn against the pathogens in the environment. The effect of maternal antibodies on microparasite transmission dynamics may have important consequences for both the fitness of the host and the epizootic processes of the pathogens. However, there is a scarcity of studies examining these effects in free-living wild species. We studied the influence of maternal antibodies against the zoonotic Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) on the fitness of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and on PUUV transmission by exposing young maternal antibody-positive (MatAb+) and negative (MatAb-) bank voles (n=160) to PUUV in experimental populations. PUUV-specific maternal antibodies delayed the timing of infection. Females were more susceptible to PUUV infection than males. Interestingly, both the females and the males with maternal antibodies matured earlier than the other individuals in the population. Our results highlight the significance of maternal antibodies in the transmission of a pathogen and in the breeding success of the carriers.

"The effects of vaccination against myxomatosis and viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) on long-term mortality rates in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were studied from 1993 to 1996 by radiotracking a free-living population of wild rabbits. During the three months after immunisation, unvaccinated young rabbits weighing between 180 and 600 g were 13.6 times more likely to die than vaccinated young rabbits. In adult rabbits, vaccination did not significantly decrease mortality, mainly owing to the high proportion of rabbits which had previously been exposed to the antigens of both diseases. Compared with adult rabbits with natural antibodies to VHD, rabbits without these antibodies were 5.2 times more likely to die of VHD during annual outbreaks.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitors combined with pegylated alfa interferon-ribavirin have demonstrated improved efficacy compared with pegylated alfa interferon-ribavirin alone for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Asunaprevir (BMS-650032), a novel HCV NS3 protease inhibitor in clinical development, was evaluated for safety, antiviral activity, and resistance in four double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential-panel, single- and multiple-ascending-dose (SAD and MAD) studies in healthy subjects or subjects with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection. In SAD studies, subjects (healthy or with chronic HCV infection) were randomized to receive asunaprevir in dose groups of 10 to 1,200 mg or a placebo. In MAD studies, healthy subjects were randomized to receive asunaprevir in dose groups of 10 to 600 mg twice daily or a placebo for 14 days; subjects with HCV infection received asunaprevir in dose groups of 200 to 600 mg twice daily, or a placebo, for 3 days. Across all four studies, headache and diarrhea were the most frequent adverse events in asunaprevir recipients. Asunaprevir at doses of 200 to 600 mg resulted in rapid HCV RNA decreases from the baseline; maximal mean changes in HCV RNA over time were 2.7 and 3.5 log(10) IU/ml in the SAD and MAD studies, respectively. No enrichment of signature asunaprevir-resistant viral variants was detected. In conclusion, the novel NS3 protease inhibitor asunaprevir, when administered at single or multiple doses of 200 to 600 mg twice daily, is generally well tolerated, achieving rapid and substantial decreases in HCV RNA levels in subjects chronically infected with genotype 1 HCV.

"Amylin phosphorylates ERK (p-ERK) in the area postrema to reduce eating and synergizes with leptin to phosphorylate STAT3 in the arcuate (ARC) and ventromedial (VMN) hypothalamic nuclei to reduce food intake and body weight. The current studies assessed potential amylin and amylin-leptin ARC/VMN interactions on ERK signaling and their roles in postnatal hypothalamic pathway development. In amylin knockout mice, the density of agouti-related protein (AgRP)-immunoreactive (IR) fibers in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was increased, while the density of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (αMSH) fibers was decreased. In mice deficient of the amylin receptor components RAMP1/3, both AgRP and αMSH-IR fiber densities were decreased, while only αMSH-IR fiber density was decreased in rats injected neonatally in the ARC/VMN with an adeno-associated virus short hairpin RNA against the amylin core receptor. Amylin induced p-ERK in ARC neurons, 60% of which was present in POMC-expressing neurons, with none in NPY neurons. An amylin-leptin interaction was shown by an additive effect on ARC ERK signaling in neonatal rats and a 44% decrease in amylin-induced p-ERK in the ARC of leptin receptor-deficient and of ob/ob mice. Together, these results suggest that amylin directly acts, through a p-ERK-mediated process, on POMC neurons to enhance ARC-PVN αMSH pathway development.

"Gene dosage plays a critical role in a range of cellular phenotypes, yet most cellular expression systems use heterologous cDNA-based vectors which express proteins well above physiological levels. In contrast, genomic DNA expression vectors generate physiologically-relevant levels of gene expression by carrying the whole genomic DNA locus of a gene including its regulatory elements. Here we describe the first genomic DNA expression library generated using the high-capacity herpes simplex virus-1 amplicon technology to deliver bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) into cells by viral transduction. The infectious BAC (iBAC) library contains 184,320 clones with an average insert size of 134.5 kb. We show in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) disease model cell line and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that this library can be used for genetic rescue studies in a range of contexts including the physiological restoration of Ldlr deficiency, and viral receptor expression. The iBAC library represents an important new genetic analysis tool openly available to the research community.

"We have developed, characterized and utilized paired segments of fetal intestine subcutaneously transplanted into heterogenic nude or SCID mice as a model system for the study of viral, bacterial and protozoal pathogens. The xenografted intestine matures in the recipient mouse and is biochemically and anatomically comparable to intestine from age-matched, whole-animal controls. The grafted tissue is free of ingesta, intestinal flora, extra-intestinal secretions and host immune functions. The transplanted intestine is long-lived and easily accessible to manipulation and harvest. Tissue from a single fetal donor can be used to create numerous xenografts allowing for tightly controlled experiments. Xenografts enable the study of species-specific intestinal pathogens in the homologous intestinal tissue thus preserving biological applicability of results. Xenografts can be used to study pathogenesis, pathophysiology and therapeutics of enteric disease in situations where such study might otherwise be prohibitively expensive or confounded by intercurrent variables inherent to whole animals. Xenografts have important advantages over in vitro models that may not approximate the in vivo biology of the intestine in the disease process.

"BACKGROUND: Human influenza viruses are known to bind to sialic acid linked alpha2-6 to galactose, but the binding specificity beyond that linkage has not been systematically examined. H3N2 human influenza isolates lost binding to chicken red cells in the 1990s but viruses isolated since 2003 have re-acquired the ability to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes. We have investigated specificity of binding, changes in hemagglutinin sequence of the recent viruses and the role of sialic acid in productive infection. RESULTS: Viruses that agglutinate, or do not agglutinate, chicken red cells show identical binding to a Glycan Array of 264 oligosaccharides, binding exclusively to a subset of alpha2-6-sialylsaccharides. We identified an amino acid change in hemagglutinin that seemed to correlate with chicken red cell binding but when tested by mutagenesis there was no effect. Recombinant hemagglutinins expressed on Sf-9 cells bound chicken red cells but the released recombinant baculoviruses agglutinated only human red cells. Similarly, an isolate that does not agglutinate chicken red cells show hemadsorption of chicken red cells to infected MDCK cells. We suggest that binding of chicken red cells to cell surface hemagglutinin but not to virions is due to a more favorable hemagglutinin density on the cell surface. We investigated whether a virus specific for alpha2-6 sialyloligosaccharides shows differential entry into cells that have varying proportions of alpha2-6 and alpha2-3 sialic acids, including human A549 and HeLa cells with high levels of alpha2-6 sialic acid, and CHO cells that have only alpha2-3 sialic acid. We found that the virus enters all cell types tested and synthesizes viral nucleoprotein, localized in the nucleus, and hemagglutinin, transported to the cell surface, but infectious progeny viruses were released only from MDCK cells. CONCLUSION: Agglutination of chicken red cells does not correlate with altered binding to any oligosaccharide on the Glycan Array, and may result from increased avidity due to density of hemagglutinin and not increased affinity. Absence of alpha2-6 sialic acid does not protect a cell from influenza infection and the presence of high levels of alpha2-6-sialic acids on a cell surface does not guarantee productive replication of a virus with alpha2-6 receptor specificity.

"Background: Cannabis use and elevated fatty liver index (FLI≥ 60) (a biomarker of hepatic steatosis in the general population) have been identified as predictors of HCV-related and overall mortality, respectively, in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. However, the relationship between cannabis use and the risk of elevated FLI has never been explored.Methods: Using five-year follow-up data from 997 HIV-HCV co-infected patients (ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort), we analyzed the relationship between cannabis use and FLI using mixed-effects multivariable logistic (outcome: elevated FLI yes/no) and linear (outcome: continuous FLI) regression models.Results: At the last follow-up visit, 27.4% of patients reported regular or daily cannabis use and 27.8% had elevated FLI. After multivariable adjustment, regular or daily cannabis use was associated with a 55% lower risk of elevated FLI (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.45 [0.22; 0.94]; p = 0.033) and lower FLI values (adjusted model coefficient: -4.24 [-6.57; -1.91], p < 0.0001).Conclusions: Cannabis use is associated with a reduced risk of elevated fatty liver index in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Further research is needed to confirm whether and how cannabinoids may inhibit the development of hepatic steatosis or other metabolic disorders in high-risk populations.

"The application of plant virus-derived nanostructures in materials science, biomedical research and engineering has recently been promoted by the development of fluorescence-labeled viruses for optical imaging in tissue culture and preclinical animal models. Most studies reported thus far have focused on the application of viruses that have been chemically modified with organic dyes. In this investigation, we sought to develop and study genetically-engineered virus-based biomaterials that incorporate green or red fluorescent proteins. The genetic introduction of such imaging moieties is advantageous because post-harvest modifications are not required, thus minimizing the number of manufacturing steps and maximizing the yields of each fluorescent probe. Specifically, we engineered the filamentous plant virus Potato virus X (PVX) to display green fluorescent protein (GFP) or mCherry as N-terminal coat protein (CP) fusions, producing a 1 : 3 fusion protein to CP ratio. The infection of Nicotiana benthamiana plants with the recombinant GFP-PVX and mCherry-PVX particles was documented by fluorescence imaging, structural analysis and genetic characterization to determine the stability of the chimeras and optimize the molecular farming protocols. We also demonstrated the application of fluorescent mCherry-PVX filaments as probes for optical imaging in human cancer cells and a preclinical mouse model. Cell viability assays and histological analysis following the administration of mCherry-PVX indicated the biocompatibility and rapid tissue clearance of the particles. Such particles could therefore be functionalized with additional cancer-specific detection ligands to provide tools for molecular imaging, allowing the investigation of molecular signatures, disease progression/recurrence and the efficacy of novel therapies.

"The proteases (PR) of retroviruses are expressed as gag-PR fused polyprotein. The active PR is a dimer obtained after the aggregation of the gag and gag-pro precursors, which leads to the formation and the release of the viral particle. Subsequently, in the cell, the PR is present essentially as a monomeric polyprotein. To mimic the antigenic properties of such an intracellular form of the PR, we produced a monomeric form of the HTLV-I (human T-cell leukemia virus, type-I) PR fused to the maltose binding protein (MBP-PR). Monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against MBP-PR were developed. Three mabs were obtained that recognized different epitopes. Two were directed against the NH2-terminus, a region that contributes to the dimerization interface. The other was specific to a peptide that lines the substrate binding pocket. This latter epitope is located just downstream of the D-T-G peptide of the catalytic site. The two identified regions contained the amino acids Asp6, Arg10 and Asp36, which were previously shown to be important in the stabilization of the dimer. In view of the localization of the recognized epitopes, these mabs will be useful for inhibition studies of the HTLV-I PR by intracellular immunization.

"Scrapie is a slow infection of the nervous system which progresses in the absence of any apparent immune response. The recent development of a large-scale purification protocol for scrapie prions made it possible to obtain substantial quantities of electrophoretically purified prion protein (PrP 27-30) and we report here on the successful production of a rabbit antiserum to PrP 27-30. The antiserum reacted with PrP 27-30 and several lower molecular weight proteins as shown by Western blots; it did not react with protein preparations from uninfected brains. Discrete structures in the subependymal region of scrapie-infected hamster brains were stained immunocytochemically. These same structures also stained with Congo red dye and showed green birefringence with polarized light, a characteristic of purified prion rods. This staining pattern suggests that they are amyloid plaques.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coffee has anti-inflammatory and hepato-protective properties. In the general population, drinking ≥3cups of coffee/day has been associated with a 14% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between coffee consumption and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH is an ongoing French nationwide prospective cohort of patients co-infected with HIV-HCV collecting both medical and psychosocial/behavioural data (annual self-administered questionnaires). We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the effect of elevated coffee consumption (≥3cups/day) at baseline on all-cause mortality during the cohort's five-year follow-up. RESULTS: Over a median [interquartile range] follow-up of 5.0 [3.9-5.9] years, 77 deaths occurred among 1,028 eligible patients (mortality rate 1.64/100 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-2.05). Leading causes of death were HCV-related diseases (n=33, 43%), cancers unrelated to AIDS/HCV (n=9, 12%), and AIDS (n=8, 10%). At the first available visit, 26.6% of patients reported elevated coffee consumption. Elevated coffee consumption at baseline was associated with a 50% reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.5; CI 0.3-0.9; p=0.032), after adjustment for gender and psychosocial, behavioral and clinical time-varying factors. CONCLUSIONS: Drinking three or more cups of coffee per day halves all-cause mortality risk in patients co-infected with HIV-HCV. The benefits of coffee extracts and supplementing dietary intake with other anti-inflammatory compounds need to be evaluated in this population. LAY SUMMARY: Coffee has anti-inflammatory and hepato-protective properties but its effect on mortality risk has never been investigated in patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This study shows that elevated coffee consumption (≥3cups/day) halves all-cause mortality risk in patients co-infected with HIV-HCV. The benefits of coffee extracts and supplementing dietary intake with other anti-inflammatory compounds need to be evaluated in this population.

"BACKGROUND: Multiple neuropeptides, sometimes with opposing functions, can be produced from one precursor gene. To study the roles of the different neuropeptides encoded by one large precursor we developed a method to overexpress minigenes and establish local secretion. RESULTS: We fused the signal peptide from the Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) to a furin site followed by a processed form of the Agouti related protein (AgRP), AgRP(83-132) or alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone. In vitro, these minigenes were secreted and biologically active. Additionally, the proteins of the minigenes were not transported into projections of primary neurons, thereby ensuring local release. In vivo administration of VWF-AgRP(83-132), using an adeno-associated viral vector as a delivery vehicle, into the paraventricular hypothalamus increased body weight and food intake of these rats compared to rats which received a control vector. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that removal of the N-terminal part of full length AgRP and addition of a VWF signal peptide is a successful strategy to deliver neuropeptide minigenes to the brain and establish local neuropeptide secretion.

"1. Identifying general patterns of how and why survival rates vary across space and time is necessary to truly understand population dynamics of a species. However, this is not an easy task given the complexity and interactions of processes involved, and the interpopulation differences in main survival determinants. 2. Here, using European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as a model and information from local studies, we investigated whether we could make inferences about trends and drivers of survival of a species that are generalizable to large spatio-temporal scales. To do this, we first focused on overall survival and then examined cause-specific mortalities, mainly predation and diseases, which may lead to those patterns. 3. Our results show that within the large-scale variability in rabbit survival, there exist general patterns that are explained by the integration of factors previously known to be important at the local level (i.e. age, climate, diseases, predation or density dependence). We found that both inter- and intrastudy survival rates increased in magnitude and decreased in variability as rabbits grow old, although this tendency was less pronounced in populations with epidemic diseases. Some causes leading to these higher mortalities in young rabbits could be the stronger effect of rainfall at those ages, as well as, other death sources like malnutrition or infanticide. 4. Predation is also greater for newborns and juveniles, especially in population without diseases. Apart from the effect of diseases, predation patterns also depended on factors, such as, density, season, and type and density of predators. Finally, we observed that infectious diseases also showed general relationships with climate, breeding (i.e. new susceptible rabbits) and age, although the association type varied between myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease. 5. In conclusion, large-scale patterns of spatio-temporal variability in rabbit survival emerge from the combination of different factors that interrelate both directly and through density dependence. This highlights the importance of performing more comprehensive studies to reveal combined effects and complex relationships that help us to better understand the mechanisms underlying population dynamics.

"The laboratory rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is widely used as a model for a variety of inherited and acquired human diseases. In addition, the rabbit is the smallest livestock animal that is used to transgenically produce pharmaceutical proteins in its milk. Here we describe a protocol for high-efficiency germline transgenesis and sustained transgene expression in rabbits by using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system. The protocol is based on co-injection into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes of synthetic mRNA encoding the SB100X hyperactive transposase together with plasmid DNA carrying a transgene construct flanked by binding sites for the transposase. The translation of the transposase mRNA is followed by enzyme-mediated excision of the transgene cassette from the plasmids and its permanent genomic insertion to produce stable transgenic animals. Generation of a germline-transgenic founder animal by using this protocol takes ∼2 months. Transposon-mediated transgenesis compares favorably in terms of both efficiency and reliable transgene expression with classic pronuclear microinjection, and it offers comparable efficacies (numbers of transgenic founders obtained per injected embryo) to lentiviral approaches, without limitations on vector design, issues of transgene silencing, and the toxicity and biosafety concerns of working with viral vectors.

"The unprecedented global demand for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has demonstrated the need for highly effective vaccine candidates that are thermostable and amenable to large-scale manufacturing. Nanoparticle immunogens presenting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) in repetitive arrays are being advanced as second-generation vaccine candidates, as they feature robust manufacturing characteristics and have shown promising immunogenicity in preclinical models. Here, we used previously reported deep mutational scanning (DMS) data to guide the design of stabilized variants of the RBD. The selected mutations fill a cavity in the RBD that has been identified as a linoleic acid binding pocket. Screening of several designs led to the selection of two lead candidates that expressed at higher yields than the wild-type RBD. These stabilized RBDs possess enhanced thermal stability and resistance to aggregation, particularly when incorporated into an icosahedral nanoparticle immunogen that maintained its integrity and antigenicity for 28 days at 35-40°C, while corresponding immunogens displaying the wild-type RBD experienced aggregation and loss of antigenicity. The stabilized immunogens preserved the potent immunogenicity of the original nanoparticle immunogen, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial. Our findings may improve the scalability and stability of RBD-based coronavirus vaccines in any format and more generally highlight the utility of comprehensive DMS data in guiding vaccine design.

"Puumala virus (PUUV) causes an acute hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a zoonosis also called nephropathia epidemica (NE). The reservoir host of PUUV is the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Herein we review the main clinical manifestations of NE, acute kidney injury, increased vascular permeability, coagulation abnormalities as well as pulmonary, cardiac, central nervous system and ocular manifestations of the disease. Several biomarkers of disease severity have recently been discovered: interleukin-6, pentraxin-3, C-reactive protein, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, cell-free DNA, soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator, GATA-3 and Mac-2 binding protein. The role of cytokines, vascular endothelial growth hormone, complement, bradykinin, cellular immune response and other mechanisms in the pathogenesis of NE as well as host genetic factors will be discussed. Finally therapeutic aspects and directions for further research will be handled.

"Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) may lead to subclinical, acute or chronic hepatitis. In the prevaccination era, HBV infections were endemic due to frequent mother to child transmission in large regions of the world. However, there are still estimated 240 million chronic HBV carriers today and ca. 620,000 patients die per year due to HBV-related liver diseases. Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-α and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to satisfactory results. Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunomodulation may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence. Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients with or without therapeutic reduction of viral load did not result in effective immune control of HBV infection, suggesting that combination of antiviral treatment with new formulations of therapeutic vaccines is needed. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) and its HBV-like woodchuck hepatitis virus are a useful preclinical animal model for developing new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments using nucleos(t)ide analogues, with prime-boost vaccination using DNA vaccines, new hepadnaviral antigens or recombinant adenoviral vectors were tested in the woodchuck model. In this review, we summarize these encouraging results obtained with these therapeutic vaccines. In addition, we present potential innovations in immunostimulatory strategies by blocking the interaction of the inhibitory programmed death receptor 1 with its ligand in this animal model.

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is caused by a lagovirus mainly affecting European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), although other European and North American lagomorph species are also susceptible to fatal infection by the new viral variant RHDV2/b. In the present work, direct mechanical transmission of the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV2/b variant) by the hematophagous Diptera Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) and the sand fly Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) (Diptera: Psychodidae) was tested. For each species, six and three laboratory rabbits were exposed to bites of dipterous females partially fed on RHDV2/b viral suspension 2 h and 24 h prior to exposure, respectively. The rabbits were then monitored for clinical changes and mortality for 35 d, and seroconversion was assessed by indirect ELISA. No rabbit died or showed clinical signs of disease, and seroconversion was recorded in two rabbits challenged with P. papatasi females fed the viral suspension 2 h prior to exposure. The number of RHDV2/b RNA copies/female was higher in Ae. albopictus than in P. papatasi but the decrease over time of RNA load in Ae. albopictus was greater than that in P. papatasi. The results of this study suggest the inability of Ae. albopictus to serve as a direct mechanical vector of RHDV2/b, but sand flies could play a role in the local transmission of RHD.

"The Eastern woodchuck ( Marmota monax ) harbors a DNA virus (Woodchuck hepatitis virus [WHV]) that is similar in structure and replicative life cycle to the human hepatitis B virus (HBV). Like HBV, WHV infects the liver and can cause acute and chronic hepatitis. Furthermore, chronic WHV infection in woodchucks usually leads to development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) within the first 2-4 years of life. The woodchuck model has been important in the preclinical evaluation of safety and efficacy of the antiviral drugs now in use for treatment of HBV infection and continues to serve as an important, predictive model for innovative forms of therapy of hepatitis B using antiviral nucleosides and immune response modifiers alone or in combination. Almost all woodchucks that become chronic WHV carriers after experimental neonatal inoculation develop HCC with a median HCC-free survival of 24 months and a median life expectancy of 30-32 months. The woodchuck model of viral-induced HCC has been used effectively for the development of new imaging agents for enhancement of detection of hepatic neoplasms by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The chemoprevention of HCC using long-term antiviral nucleoside therapy has been shown in the woodchuck, and ""proof of principal"" has been established for some of the innovative, molecular methods for treatment of HCC. The model is available for fundamental investigations of the viral and molecular mechanisms responsible for hepatocarcinogenesis and should have substantial value for future development of innovative methods for chemoprevention and gene therapy of human HCC.

"Macquarie Island, a small subantarctic island, is home to rockhopper, royal and king penguins, which are often infested with the globally distributed seabird tick, Ixodes uriae. A flavivirus, an orbivirus, a phlebovirus, and a nairovirus were isolated from these ticks and partial sequences obtained. The flavivirus was nearly identical to Gadgets Gully virus, isolated some 30 year previously, illustrating the remarkable genetic stability of this virus. The nearest relative to the orbivirus (for which we propose the name Sandy Bay virus) was the Scottish Broadhaven virus, and provided only the second available sequences from the Great Island orbivirus serogroup. The phlebovirus (for which we propose the name Catch-me-cave virus) and the previously isolated Precarious Point virus were distinct but related, with both showing homology with the Finnish Uukuniemi virus. These penguin viruses provided the second and third available sequences for the Uukuniemi group of phleboviruses. The nairovirus (for which we propose the name Finch Creek virus) was shown to be related to the North American Tillamook virus, the Asian Hazara virus and Nairobi sheep disease virus. Macquarie Island penguins thus harbour arboviruses from at least four of the seven arbovirus-containing genera, with related viruses often found in the northern hemisphere.

"Eleven species of small African wild mammals, laboratory rabbits, guinea pigs, and Syrian hamsters were infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus. Low-titered viremia followed by development of antibody was observed in scrub hares (Lepus saxatilis), Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris), red veld rats (Aethomys chrysophilus), white tailed rats (Mystromys albicaudatus), bushveld gerbils (Tatera leucogaster), striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio), and guinea pigs. The maximum viremic titer in 4 scrub hares was 10(1.7-4.2) 50% mouse lethal doses/ml. Viremia was detected in 1/17 infected laboratory rabbits. Antibody response was only detected in South African hedgehogs (Atelerix frontalis), highveld gerbils (T. brantsii), Namaqua gerbils (Desmodillus auricularis), 2 species of multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis and M. coucha), and Syrian hamsters. The results of the study indicate that a proportion of infected scrub hares develop CCHF viremia of an intensity shown in the Soviet Union to be sufficient for infection of feeding immature ixodid ticks, but that South African hedgehogs and wild rodents are unlikely to be of importance as maintenance hosts of the virus in southern Africa.

"Hydroponically grown microgreens are gaining in popularity, but there is a lack of information pertaining to their microbiological safety. The potential risks associated with virus contamination of crops within a hydroponic system have not been studied to date. Here a human norovirus (huNoV) surrogate (murine norovirus [MNV]) was evaluated for its ability to become internalized from roots to edible tissues of microgreens. Subsequently, virus survival in recirculated water without adequate disinfection was assessed. Kale and mustard seeds were grown on hydroponic pads (for 7 days with harvest at days 8 to 12), edible tissues (10 g) were cut 1 cm above the pads, and corresponding pieces (4 cm by 4 cm) of pads containing only roots were collected separately. Samples were collected from a newly contaminated system (recirculated water inoculated with ∼3 log PFU/ml MNV on day 8) and from a previously contaminated system. (A contaminated system without adequate disinfection or further inoculation was used for production of another set of microgreens.) Viral titers and RNA copies were quantified by plaque assay and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The behaviors of MNV in kale and mustard microgreens were similar (P > 0.05). MNV was detected in edible tissues and roots after 2 h postinoculation, and the levels were generally stable during the first 12 h. Relatively low levels (∼2.5 to ∼1.5 log PFU/sample of both edible tissues and roots) of infectious viruses were found with a decreasing trend over time from harvest days 8 to 12. However, the levels of viral RNA present were higher and consistently stable (∼4.0 to ∼5.5 log copies/sample). Recirculated water maintained relatively high levels of infectious MNV over the period of harvest, from 3.54 to 2.73 log PFU/ml. Importantly, cross-contamination occurred easily; MNV remained infectious in previously contaminated hydroponic systems for up to 12 days (2.26 to 1.00 PFU/ml), and MNV was detected in both edible tissues and roots. Here we see that viruses can be recirculated in water, even after an initial contamination event is removed, taken up through the roots of microgreens, and transferred to edible tissues. The ease of product contamination shown here reinforces the need for proper sanitation.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients are at high risk of metabolic complications and liver-related events, which are both associated with hepatic steatosis and its progressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a known risk factor for mortality. The fatty liver index (FLI), a noninvasive steatosis biomarker, has recently drawn attention for its clinical prognostic value, although its capacity to predict mortality risk in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients has never been investigated. Using a Cox proportional hazards model for mortality from all causes, with data from the French National Agency for Research on Aids and Viral Hepatitis CO13 HEPAVIH cohort (983 patients, 4,432 visits), we tested whether elevated FLI (≥60) was associated with all-cause mortality. APPROACH AND RESULTS: After multiple adjustment, individuals with FLI ≥ 60 had almost double the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.91 [1.17-3.12], P = 0.009), independently of the following factors: HCV cure (0.21 [0.07-0.61], P = 0.004), advanced fibrosis (1.77 [1.00-3.14], P = 0.05), history of hepatocellular carcinoma and/or liver transplantation (7.74 [3.82-15.69], P < 10(-3) ), history of indirect clinical signs of cirrhosis (2.80 [1.22-6.41], P = 0.015), and HIV Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical stage C (2.88 [1.74-4.79], P < 10(-3) ). CONCLUSIONS: An elevated FLI (≥60) is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in HIV-HCV-coinfected patients independently of liver fibrosis and HCV cure. In the present era of nearly 100% HCV cure rates thanks to direct-acting antivirals, these findings encourage the more systematic use of noninvasive steatosis biomarkers to help identify coinfected patients with higher mortality risk.

"A yellow fever (YFV) 17D virus variant, which causes persistent infection of mouse neuroblastoma cells associated with defective cell penetration and small plaque size, yielded plaque-revertant viruses from cells transfected with viral transcripts encoding the adaptive mutation (Gly360 in the E protein). Reconstruction of a plaque-purified revertant which contained Gly360 and additional substitutions (Asn for Lys303 and Val for Ala261) yielded a virus whose infectious center size, growth efficiency, and cell penetration rate similar to the parental YF5.2iv virus, whereas viruses with Asn303 or Val261 alone with Gly360 yielded either a small-plaque virus or a parental revertant. These data indicate that the YFV E protein is subject to suppression of mutations in domain III that are deleterious for viral entry and spread by a second-site mutation in domain II. Position 261 lies within the hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket at the domain I-II interface, a site believed to be involved in the hinge-like conformational change of domain II during activation of membrane fusion-activity. Results of this study provide genetic data consistent with findings on flavivirus structure and implicate domain III in functions beyond simply cell surface attachment.

"This study focused on the importance of the colmation layer in the removal of cyanobacteria, viruses, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) during natural bank filtration. Injection-and-recovery studies were performed at two shallow (0.5 m deep), sandy, near-shore sites at the southern end of Ashumet Pond, a waste-impacted, kettle pond on Cape Cod, MA, that is subject to periodic blooms of cyanobacteria and continuously recharges a sole-source drinking-water aquifer. The experiment involved assessing the transport behaviors of bromide (conservative tracer), sp. IU625 (cyanobacterium, 2.6 ± 0.2 µm), AS-1 (tailed cyanophage, 110 nm long), MS2 (coliphage, 26 nm diameter), and carboxylate-modified microspheres (1.7 µm diameter) introduced to the colmation layer using a bag-and-barrel (Lee-type) seepage meter. The injectate constituents were tracked as they were advected across the pond water-groundwater interface and through the underlying aquifer sediments under natural-gradient conditions past push-point samplers placed at ∼30-cm intervals along a 1.2-m-long, diagonally downward flow path. More than 99% of the microspheres, IU625, MS2, AS-1, and ∼44% of the pond DOC were removed in the colmation layer (upper 25 cm of poorly sorted bottom sediments) at two test locations characterized by dissimilar seepage rates (1.7 vs. 0.26 m d). Retention profiles in recovered core material indicated that >82% of the attached IU625 were in the top 3 cm of bottom sediments. The colmation layer was also responsible for rapid changes in the character of the DOC and was more effective (by three orders of magnitude) at removing microspheres than was the underlying 20-cm-thick segment of sediment.

"Hepatitis C is a transmissible hepatic and extra-hepatic disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV develops into a chronic infection among approximately 70% of the contaminated subjects. Chronic HCV infection is estimated to affect between 0.5% and 1 % of the general population in France, which causes an important burden of disease, in particular due to the occurrence of cirrhosis and liver cancer. New antiviral drugs now allow to cure more than 95% of patients in just a few weeks of treatment with very limited safety issues. This therapeutic revolution has led the World Health Organization and many national governments to aim for an elimination of HCV, which has been defined as a 90%-reduction of the incidence rate, and a 65%-reduction in the number of HCV-related deaths on the basis of the 2015 figures. In this respect, the French Ministry of Health has recently decided to extend the ability to prescribe the new antiviral drugs to any physician. However, the elimination campaign of HCV will also need to correctly identify, screen, and treat the main target populations. If people who inject drugs (PWIDs) certainly constitute the most important population concerned by the challenge of HCV elimination, more hidden reservoirs in which HCV transmission can insidiously evolve should be identified and specifically targeted as well. Inpatient psychiatric populations might constitute one of these hidden reservoirs. International data suggest that chronic HCV infection affects approximately 5% of psychiatric inpatients in Europe. This very high prevalence estimate can in part be due to the very frequent psychiatric disorders found among the current or former PWIDs. However, a part of the seropositive patients does not report a history of drug use, and other factors could contribute to the increased risk of contamination in this population including atypical routes of transmission related to institutional promiscuity. Exploring the general profile and risk-behaviors of the psychiatric inpatients found infected by the HCV is thus warranted for future studies. Screening and treating HCV in the specific population of psychiatric patients is part of the general public health objective of eliminating HCV at a national level. Moreover, it also directly fits into the individualized psychiatric care. Many recent data suggest that HCV also has a neural tropism, in particular within glial cells, such as astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. As such, HCV foments inflammatory processes in the brain and contributes to cognitive impairments and psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety or depression. At the individual level, treating HCV infection can improve the psychiatric state and increase patients' outcomes in terms of well-being and quality of life. For all these reasons, the field of psychiatry needs local and national actions for informing and training professionals about HCV screening and treating modalities. Patient and family associations also need to be involved in this general effort of micro-elimination. A key role should be assigned to the general practitioners embedded within inpatient psychiatric units. They are the best fitted professionals to screen, treat, and empower patients, to inform and train other caregivers of the psychiatric field, and to act as a relay with hepatology teams if required. Hospital pharmacists are other important stakeholders. In a national context in which the funding of psychiatric care, including medications, is based on predefined funding envelops, innovative initiatives will have to be set up by local or national health authorities, in partnership with pharmacists, to allow for the treatment of psychiatric inpatients. In conclusion, the world of psychiatry is a possible hidden reservoir of HCV and, as such, a part of the challenge for eliminating the virus. Patients, families, and caregivers will have to be correctly sensitized and trained to play their role in the process. Specific investigations will be required to better understand why such an increased prevalence of HCV is observed in this population. Specific adaptations of the cascade of care within psychiatric settings, including access to treatment, will need to be designed, implemented, and evaluated for reaching micro-elimination of HCV in psychiatry.

"Development of safe and protective vaccines against infectious pathogens remains a challenge. Inactivation of rabies virus is a critical step in the production of vaccines and other research reagents. Beta-propiolactone (βPL); the currently used inactivating agent for rabies virus is expensive and proved to be carcinogenic in animals. This study aimed to investigate the ability of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to irreversibly inactivate rabies virus without affecting its antigenicity and immunogenicity in pursuit of finding safe, effective and inexpensive alternative inactivating agents. H2O2 3% rapidly inactivated a Vero cell adapted fixed rabies virus strain designated as FRV/K within 2h of exposure without affecting its antigenicity or immunogenicity. No residual infectious virus was detected and the H2O2-inactivated vaccine proved to be safe and effective when compared with the same virus harvest inactivated with the classical inactivating agent βPL. Mice immunized with H2O2-inactivated rabies virus produced sufficient level of antibodies and were protected when challenged with lethal CVS virus. These findings reinforce the idea that H2O2 can replace βPL as inactivating agent for rabies virus to reduce time and cost of inactivation process.

"2-Deoxy-2-[(18)F]fluoro-D-glucose ([(18)F] FDG) is used for PET imaging of woodchuck (Marmota monax) model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The usefulness of FDG on this animal model needs to be validated according to the hypothesized mechanisms. In this study, two key enzymes involved in glucose or [(18)F] FDG metabolism, hexokinase (HK) and glucose-6-phophatase (G6Pase), were examined for their enzymatic activities in the woodchuck models of HCC, which has not been studied before. After dynamic PET scans, woodchuck liver tissue samples were harvested and the homogenate was centrifuged. The supernatant was used for HK activity assay and the microsomal pellet was used for G6Pase assay. HK and G6Pase activities were measured by means of colorimetric reactions via kinetic and end-point assays, respectively. Total protein content was measured by the Bradford method and used to normalize all enzyme activities. HK and G6Pase activities in woodchuck HCC will be used to correlate with in vivo PET imaging data. The woodchuck model of HCC had significantly increased levels of HK in the livers compared to the age-matching healthy woodchuck (7.96 +/- 1.27 vs. 2.74 +/- 0.66 mU/mg protein, P < 0.01) and significantly decreased levels of G6Pase compared to healthy woodchuck (40.35 +/- 19.28 vs. 237.01 +/- 17.32 mU/mg protein, P < 0.01), reflecting an increase in glycolysis. In addition, significant differences were found in HK and G6Pase activities between HCC liver region (HK: 7.96 +/- 1.27 mU/mg protein; G6Pase: 40.35 +/- 19.28 mU/mg protein) and surrounding normal liver region (HK: 2.98 +/- 0.92 mU/mg protein; G6Pase: 140.87 +/- 30.62 mU/mg protein) in the same woodchuck model of HCC (P < 0.01). Our study demonstrated an increased HK activity and a decreased G6Pase activity in liver of the woodchuck models of HCC as compared to normal woodchuck liver.

"PURPOSE: To determine the impact of the COVID-19 on the CT activities in French radiological centers during the epidemic peak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective CT scan survey was conducted between March 16 and April 12, 2020, in accordance with the local IRB. Seven hundred nine radiology centers were invited to participate in a weekly online survey. Numbers of CT examinations related to COVID-19 including at least chest (CT(covid)) and whole chest CT scan activities (CT(chest)) were recorded each week. A sub-analysis on French departments was performed during the 4 weeks of the study. The impact of the number of RT-PCRs (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions) on the CT workflow was tested using two-sample t test and Pearson's test. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-seven structures finally registered (78%) with mean response numbers of 336 ± 18.9 (323; 351). Mean CT(chest) activity per radiologic structure ranged from 75.8 ± 133 (0-1444) on week 12 to 99.3 ± 138.6 (0-1147) on week 13. Mean ratio of CT(covid) on CT(chest) varied from 0.36 to 0.59 on week 12 and week 14 respectively. There was a significant relationship between the number of RT-PCR performed and the number of CT(covid) (r = 0.73, p = 3.10(-16)) but no link with the number of positive RT-PCR results. CONCLUSION: In case of local high density COVID-19, CT workflow is strongly modified and redirected to the management of these specific patients. KEY POINTS: • Over the 4-week survey period, 117,686 chest CT (CT(total)) were performed among the responding centers, including 61,784 (52%) CT performed for COVID-19 (CT(covid)). • Across the country, the ratio CT(covid)/CT(total) varied from 0.36 to 0.59 and depended significantly on the local epidemic density (p = 0.003). • In clinical practice, in a context of growing epidemic, in France, chest CT was used as a surrogate to RT-PCR for patient triage.

"Defective interfering particles (DIPs) are virus mutants that lack essential genes for growth. In coinfections with helper virus, the diversion of viral proteins to the replication and packaging of DIP genomes can interfere with virus production. Mounting cases of DIPs and DIP-like genomes in clinical and natural isolates, as well as growing interest in DIP-based therapies, underscore a need to better elucidate how DIPs work. DIP activity is primarily measured by its inhibition of virus infection yield, an endpoint that masks the dynamic and potentially diverse individual cell behaviors. Using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a model, we coinfected BHK cells with VSV DIPs and recombinant helper virus carrying a gene encoding a red fluorescent protein (RFP) whose expression correlates with the timing and level of virus release. For single cells within a monolayer, 10 DIPs per cell suppressed the reporter expression in only 1.2% of the cells. In most cells, it slowed and reduced viral gene expression, manifested as a shift in mean latent time from 4 to 6 h and reduced virus yields by 10-fold. For single cells isolated in microwells, DIP effects were more pronounced, reducing virus yields by 100-fold and extending latent times to 12 h, including individual instances above 20 h. Together, these results suggest that direct or indirect cell-cell interactions prevent most coinfected cells from being completely suppressed by DIPs. Finally, a gamma distribution model captures well how the infection kinetics quantitatively depends on the DIP dose. Such models will be useful for advancing a predictive biology of DIP-associated virus growth and infection spread. IMPORTANCE: During the last century, basic studies in virology have focused on developing a molecular mechanistic understanding of how infectious viruses reproduce in their living host cells. However, over the last 10 years, the advent of deep sequencing and other powerful technologies has revealed in natural and patient infections that viruses do not act alone. Instead, viruses are often accompanied by defective virus-like particles that carry large deletions in their genomes and fail to replicate on their own. Coinfections of viable and defective viruses behave in unpredictable ways, but they often interfere with normal virus growth, potentially enabling infections to evade host immune surveillance. In the current study, controlled levels of defective viruses are coinfected with viable viruses that have been engineered to express a fluorescent reporter protein during infection. Unique profiles of reporter expression acquired from thousands of coinfected cells reveal how interference acts at multiple stages of infection.

"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare health-related quality of life (HRQL) during and after hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment in patients receiving pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN)-containing therapy (including boceprevir or telaprevir-ANRS CO20 CUPIC cohort) who subsequently switched to PEG-IFN-free regimens (sofosbuvir + ledipasvir with or without ribavirin [RBV]-SIRIUS trial). METHODS: Two analyses were performed. The first compared physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) HRQL (MOS SF-12) scores during treatment between CUPIC and SIRIUS. The second compared PCS and MCS scores after treatment end between CUPIC and SIRIUS. The analyses used linear regression mixed models adjusted for pre-treatment HRQL scores, gender, and age at each visit. RESULTS: Among patients enrolled successively in both studies, 43 (corresponding to 212 HRQL assessments) and 43 (82 HRQL assessments) were eligible for the 'during' and 'post' treatment analyses, respectively. In the 'during-treatment' analysis, we found significantly higher PCS and MCS values during PEG-IFN-free treatment than for PEG-IFN-containing treatment. In the 'post-treatment' analysis, results showed significantly higher MCS values after PEG-IFN-free treatment than after PEG-IFN-containing treatment. No significant difference was found for PCS in the post-treatment analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight an improvement in both physical and mental HRQL during HCV treatment, but no major improvement in physical HRQL after treatment end, when comparing PEG-IFN-free regimens with PEG-IFN-containing regimens. This suggests that in the PEG-IFN-free regimens era, screening and comprehensive care of comorbidities and residual somatic symptoms during treatment, and especially after HCV clearance, are still needed to improve patient outcomes.

"The virus-to-prokaryote ratio (VPR), which reflects the numerical dominance of viruses over their hosts, has been proposed as a proxy for assessing the relationship between viruses and prokaryotes. Previous studies showed that VPR values fluctuate over six orders of magnitude within and across various benthic ecosystems, with an average value of approximately 10. We hypothesize that this high VPR value is largely due to the inaccurate enumeration of viruses and prokaryotes (e.g., centrifugation treatments may lead to a three-fourfold overestimation of VPR). In this study, we evaluated the impact of processing methods on the determination of VPR values. Using an optimized procedure, we investigated the marine benthic VPR at 31 sites, from intertidal zones through continental shelves to abyssal plains, and assessed its monthly variation in two contrasting intertidal habitats (muddy-sand and sandy). By compiling 135 VPR data points of surface sediments from 37 publications, we reveal the effect of centrifugation on published VPR values and describe the spatial distribution of VPR values on a larger scale based on reliable data. The results showed that the commonly used centrifugation method may result in an overestimation of VPR values that are approximately one order of magnitude higher than those obtained using the dilution method, while other processing steps had a limited impact on the VPR. Our analysis indicates that the benthic VPR value is low and less varied across temporal and spatial scales, fluctuating mostly within 10, and the average VPR is approximately 2 in both marine and freshwater habitats. An insignificant seasonal pattern in the VPR was observed in the intertidal zone, with lower VPR values occurring at high temperatures. The VPR spatial distribution was primarily associated with sediment phaeophytin a, suggesting that the trophic conditions of the upper water column and the sedimentation of organic matter to the bottom are the key factors affecting VPR values. The mean VPR in benthic habitats is approximately one order of magnitude lower and much less varied than that observed in pelagic habitats, indicating that the virus-host relationship and the ecological function of viruses in the two ecosystems may be very different.

"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 functions as a tumor suppressor in vivo. Using transgenic mice, we show that hepatic TGF-beta1 overexpression inhibits abundance of the cyclin-dependent kinase activating tyrosine phosphatase cdc25A protein. The reduction in cdc25A protein levels was associated with increased binding of histone deacetylase 1 to p130 in the hepatic extracts. In cultured cells, HDAC1/p130 overexpression inhibited activity of the cdc25A promoter through an E2F site. TGF-beta1 treatment enhanced p130 binding to the cdc25A promoter E2F site assessed in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Hepatic proliferation induced by partial hepatectomy was associated with a decrease in the amount of HDAC1 bound to p130, without a significant decrease in p130 abundance, suggesting that HDAC1 binding to p130 may be regulated by proliferative stimuli. The induction of cdc25A abundance induced by partial hepatectomy correlated with the induction of DNA synthesis. These studies suggest that TGF-beta1 may enhance HDAC1 binding to p130 in vivo, thereby inhibiting cdc25A gene expression. TGF-beta1 regulation of HDAC1/pocket protein associations may provide a link between chromatin remodeling proteins and cdk inhibition through induction of cdc25A in vivo.

"A total of 2922 small terrestrial mammals of 12 species were collected in six localities of West Slovakia between 1981 and 1986. When examined for the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies (NA) to Central European encephalitis (CEE) virus we found that 14.6% had antibody. Nearly all (97%) of the 426 animals with antibody were Clethrionomys glareolus, the most abundant species (52.6% of mammals collected, 15.1% of those with antibody). Apodemus flavicollis (22.5% of mammals collected, 18.1% of those with antibody), Apodemus sylvaticus (14% of mammals collected, 8.5% of those with antibody), and Microtus arvalis (5.5% of mammals collected, 3.3% of those with antibody). In all locations studies the most abundant tick found on small mammals was Ixodes ricinus (larvae and nymphs). Less abundant, but present in all studied sites, were larvae and nymphs of Dermacentor reticulatus and Haemaphysalis concinna. Six strains of CEE virus were isolated from tissues of animals: four from Clethryonomys glareolus and one each from Apodemus flavicollis and Sorex araneus. Three of six isolates were from animals collected in February; none of the six had detectable neutralizing antibody to CEE virus. We discuss these observations with regard to possible mechanisms of persistence of CEE virus.

"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a signaling receptor for structurally diverse microbe-associated molecular patterns, is activated by the RSV fusion (F) protein and by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a CD14-dependent manner. TLR4 signaling by LPS also requires the presence of an additional protein, MD-2. Thus, it is possible that F protein-mediated TLR4 activation relies on MD-2 as well, although this hypothesis has not been formally tested. LPS-free RSV F protein was found to activate NF-κB in HEK293T transfectants that express wild-type (WT) TLR4 and CD14, but only when MD-2 was coexpressed. These findings were confirmed by measuring F-protein-induced interleukin 1β (IL-1β) mRNA in WT versus MD-2(-/-) macrophages, where MD-2(-/-) macrophages failed to show IL-1β expression upon F-protein treatment, in contrast to the WT. Both Rhodobacter sphaeroides LPS and synthetic E5564 (eritoran), LPS antagonists that inhibit TLR4 signaling by binding a hydrophobic pocket in MD-2, significantly reduced RSV F-protein-mediated TLR4 activity in HEK293T-TLR4-CD14-MD-2 transfectants in a dose-dependent manner, while TLR4-independent NF-κB activation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was unaffected. In vitro coimmunoprecipitation studies confirmed a physical interaction between native RSV F protein and MD-2. Further, we demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of the F1 segment of RSV F protein interacts with MD-2. These data provide new insights into the importance of MD-2 in RSV F-protein-mediated TLR4 activation. Thus, targeting the interaction between MD-2 and RSV F protein may potentially lead to novel therapeutic approaches to help control RSV-induced inflammation and pathology. IMPORTANCE: This study shows for the first time that the fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of bronchiolitis and death, particularly in infants and young children, physically interacts with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) coreceptor, MD-2, through its N-terminal domain. We show that F protein-induced TLR4 activation can be blocked by lipid A analog antagonists. This observation provides a strong experimental rationale for testing such antagonists in animal models of RSV infection for potential use in people.

"Steroid hormones are essential for the normal function of many organ systems in vertebrates. Reproductive activity in females and males, such as the differentiation, growth, and maintenance of the reproductive system, requires signaling by the sex steroids. Although extensively studied in mammals and a few fish, amphibians, and bird species, the molecular mechanisms of sex steroid hormone (estrogens, androgens, and progestins) action are poorly understood in reptiles. Here we evaluate hormone receptor ligand interactions in a freshwater turtle, the red-belly slider (Pseudemys nelsoni), after the isolation of cDNAs encoding an estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), an androgen receptor (AR), and a progesterone receptor (PR). The full-length red-belly slider turtle (t)ERalpha, tAR, and tPR cDNAs were obtained using 5' and 3' rapid amplification cDNA ends. The deduced amino acid sequences showed high identity to the chicken orthologs (tERalpha, 90%; tAR, 71%; tPR, 71%). Using transient transfection assays of mammalian cells, tERalpha protein displayed estrogen-dependent activation of transcription from an estrogen-responsive element-containing promoter. The other receptor proteins, tAR and tPR, also displayed androgen- or progestin-dependent activation of transcription from androgen- and progestin-responsive murine mammary tumor virus promoters. We further examined the transactivation of tERalpha, tAR and tPR by ligands using a modified GAL4-transactivation system. We found that the GAL4-transactivation system was not suitable for the measurement of tAR and tPR transactivations. This is the first report of the full coding regions of a reptilian AR and PR and the examination of their transactivation by steroid hormones.

"BACKGROUND & AIMS: We used longitudinal data from the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort study of HIV-HCV co-infected individuals to investigate whether polyphenol rich food intake through coffee and/or daily chocolate consumption could play a role in reducing liver enzymes levels. METHODS: Longitudinal data collection included self-administered questionnaires and medical data (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) liver enzymes). Two analyses were performed to assess the association between coffee (≥3 cups a day) and daily chocolate intake and abnormal values of AST and ALT (AST or ALT >2.5 × upper normal limit (UNL)) (N=990) over time, after adjustment for known correlates. Logistic regression models based on generalized estimating equations were used to take into account the correlations between repeated measures and estimate adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: After adjustment, patients reporting elevated coffee consumption and daily chocolate intake were less likely to present abnormal ALT (OR=0.65; p=0.04 and OR=0.57; p=0.04, for coffee and chocolate respectively), while only patients reporting elevated coffee consumption were less likely to have abnormal AST values (p=0.05). Nevertheless, the combined indicator of coffee and chocolate intake was most significantly associated with approximately 40% reduced risk of abnormal liver enzymes (p=0.003 for AST; p=0.002 for ALT). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated coffee consumption and daily chocolate intake appear to be associated with reduced levels of liver enzymes in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Further experimental and observational research is needed to better understand the role that polyphenol intake or supplementation can play on liver disease and liver injury.

"Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I variants H-2K(b) and H-2K(bm8) differ primarily in the B pocket of the peptide-binding groove, which serves to sequester the P2 secondary anchor residue. This polymorphism determines resistance to lethal herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) infection by modulating T cell responses to the immunodominant glycoprotein B(498-505) epitope, HSV8. We studied the molecular basis of these effects and confirmed that T cell receptors raised against K(b)-HSV8 cannot recognize H-2K(bm8)-HSV8. However, substitution of Ser(P2) to Glu(P2) (peptide H2E) reversed T cell receptor (TCR) recognition; H-2K(bm8)-H2E was recognized whereas H-2K(b)-H2E was not. Insight into the structural basis of this discrimination was obtained by determining the crystal structures of all four MHC class I molecules in complex with bound peptide (pMHCs). Surprisingly, we find no concerted pMHC surface differences that can explain the differential TCR recognition. However, a correlation is apparent between the recognition data and the underlying peptide-binding groove chemistry of the B pocket, revealing that secondary anchor residues can profoundly affect TCR engagement through mechanisms distinct from the alteration of the resting state conformation of the pMHC surface.

"The HPV16 E7 oncoprotein neutralizes several cell cycle checkpoints, favouring the entry of quiescent cells into S phase. This activity is mediated in part by association of E7 with the pocket proteins and consequent activation of E2F transcription factors. In addition, HPV16 E7 protein is able to promote apoptosis. In this study we demonstrate that the ability to induce apoptosis is a common property of E7s belonging to both benign and malignant HPV types. The E7-induced apoptosis is mediated by inactivation of pRb, whilst neutralization of the other two pRB-related proteins, p107 and 130, is not sufficient to trigger apoptosis. Moreover, we show that certain point mutations in the conserved region 1 (CR1) of HPV16 E7 abolish the induction of apoptosis without altering the ability to stimulate S phase. Thus, these two E7-mediated cellular events, apoptosis and S phase entry, can be separated in immortalized rodent fibroblasts. Our findings demonstrate that the E7-mediated pRb destabilization is not required for its ability to drive quiescent cells into S phase and to induce apoptosis. Finally, expression of E7 proteins in NIH3T3, which lack a functional p19ARF, does not lead to p53 accumulation, indicating that the E7 impacts upon additional cellular pathways to promote apoptosis.

"The prion gene complex (Prn) is located on mouse chromosome 2 between the beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) and agouti (A) genes. Within this complex are the prion protein gene (Prn-p), which encodes the only identified macromolecule (PrP) that purifies with infectious scrapie agent, and a scrapie incubation time gene (Prn-i). Using a variety of restriction endonucleases, six allelic forms of the Prn-p gene have been distinguished by their patterns of restriction fragment length polymorphisms. We had previously shown that the exceptionally long scrapie incubation period of I/LnJ mice inoculated with the Chandler isolate (over 200 days) was due to the effects of a scrapie incubation time gene tightly linked to Prn-p. So far, this long scrapie incubation time allele has been found only in those inbred mouse strains (I/LnJ, P/J and IM) that have the b allele of Prn-p. It is not known whether the incubation time gene and prion protein gene are two distinct loci or are one and the same. Putative recombinants between the incubation time phenotype and Prn-p genotype have been observed, but this could be due to effects of other genes segregating in the population. Regardless of whether or not the incubation time and PrP genes are identical, if any differences were found in the amino acid sequences of PrP encoded by the different Prn-p alleles there would be important implications for interpretation of results on 'strains' of scrapie agent. It would not be necessary to invoke nucleic acid as the informational macromolecule of the scrapie agent because differences in prion 'strains' recovered from mice with different Prn-p genotypes need not be the result of host selection but could be due to differences in host-encoded PrP.

"As with many other viruses, the initial cell attachment of rotaviruses, which are the major causative agent of infantile gastroenteritis, is mediated by interactions with specific cellular glycans. The distally located VP8* domain of the rotavirus spike protein VP4 (ref. 5) mediates such interactions. The existing paradigm is that 'sialidase-sensitive' animal rotavirus strains bind to glycans with terminal sialic acid (Sia), whereas 'sialidase-insensitive' human rotavirus strains bind to glycans with internal Sia such as GM1 (ref. 3). Although the involvement of Sia in the animal strains is firmly supported by crystallographic studies, it is not yet known how VP8* of human rotaviruses interacts with Sia and whether their cell attachment necessarily involves sialoglycans. Here we show that VP8* of a human rotavirus strain specifically recognizes A-type histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) using a glycan array screen comprised of 511 glycans, and that virus infectivity in HT-29 cells is abrogated by anti-A-type antibodies as well as significantly enhanced in Chinese hamster ovary cells genetically modified to express the A-type HBGA, providing a novel paradigm for initial cell attachment of human rotavirus. HBGAs are genetically determined glycoconjugates present in mucosal secretions, epithelia and on red blood cells, and are recognized as susceptibility and cell attachment factors for gastric pathogens like Helicobacter pylori and noroviruses. Our crystallographic studies show that the A-type HBGA binds to the human rotavirus VP8* at the same location as the Sia in the VP8* of animal rotavirus, and suggest how subtle changes within the same structural framework allow for such receptor switching. These results raise the possibility that host susceptibility to specific human rotavirus strains and pathogenesis are influenced by genetically controlled expression of different HBGAs among the world's population.

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a lagovirus that can cause fatal hepatitis (rabbit haemorrhagic disease, RHD) with mortality of 80-90% in farmed and wild rabbits. Since 1986, RHDV has caused outbreaks in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Europe, but never in European brown hares (Lepus europaeus, EBH). In 2010, a new RHDV-related virus, called RHDV2, emerged in Europe, causing extended epidemics because it largely overcame the immunity to RHDV present in most rabbit populations. RHDV2 also was identified in Cape hare (Lepus capensis subsp. mediterraneus) and in Italian hare (Lepus corsicanus). Here, we describe two distinct incidents of RHDV2 infection in EBH that occurred in Italy (2012) and Spain (2014). The two RHDV2 strains caused macroscopic and microscopic lesions similar to European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) in hares, and they were genetically related to other RHDV2 strains in Europe. EBHs are common in Europe, often sharing habitat with rabbits. They likely have been exposed to high levels of RHDV2 during outbreaks in rabbits in recent years, yet only two incidents of RHDV2 in EBHs have been found in Italy and Spain, suggesting that EBHs are not a primary host. Instead, they may act as spillover hosts in situations when infection pressure is high and barriers between rabbits and hares are limited, resulting in occasional infections causing EBHS-like lesions. The serological survey of stocked hare sera taken from Italian and Spanish hare populations provided an understanding of naturally occurring RHDV2 infection in the field confirming its sporadic occurrence in EBH. Our findings increase the knowledge on distribution, host range and epidemiology of RHDV2.

"The conserved region 3 (CR3) of the E7 protein of human papillomaviruses contains two CXXC motifs involved in zinc binding and in the homodimerization of the molecule. Studies have suggested that the intact CXXC motifs in the CR3 of HPV16 and HPV18 E7 are required for the in vitro transforming activity of these proteins. CR3 also contains a low affinity pRb binding site and is involved in the disruption of the E2F/Rb1 complex. E7 is structurally and functionally related to Adenovirus E1A protein, which also has two CXXC motifs in CR3. However, the Ad E1A transforming activity appears to be independent of the presence of such domains. In fact, this viral protein exists in vivo as two different forms of 289 and 243 amino acids. The shorter Ad E1A form (Ad E1A243), where both CXXC motifs are deleted by internal splicing, retains its in vitro transforming activity. We have investigated if the HPV16 E7 CR3 can be functionally replaced by the Ad E1A243 CR3, which lacks both CXXC motifs. A chimeric protein (E7/E1A243) containing the CR1 and CR2 of HPV16 E7 fused to the CR3 of Ad E1A 243 was constructed. The E7/E1A243 while not able to homodimerize in the S. cerevisiae two-hybrid system retains several of the properties of the parental proteins, HPV16 E7 and Ad E1A. It associates with the 'pocket' proteins, induces growth in soft agar of NIH3T3 cells and immortalizes rat embryo fibroblasts. These data suggest that the CXXC motifs in CR3 of E7 do not play a direct role in the transforming properties of this viral protein but probably are important for maintaining the correct protein configuration.

"BACKGROUND: Recent advances in the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments have led to the introduction of policy changes that include, in some settings, universal coverage of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment for people living with HCV. However, people who inject drugs (PWID), a population with disproportionately high rates of HCV, often experience significant social and structural barriers to care, including when seeking treatment and care for blood-borne viruses. The objective of this study is to identify implementation challenges and opportunities for improving HCV-related care and scaling up DAA treatment for PWID living with HCV in a setting with universal DAA coverage since 2018. METHODS: Informed by a critical interpretive framework, this study thematically analyzes data from in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted between October 2018 and February 2019 with a purposive sample of 15 expert stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, community-based organization representatives, policy makers) related to HCV care or research in British Columbia, Canada. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed two key thematics: First, participants described existing challenges for scaling up DAA treatment, including how contextual factors (e.g., housing, stigma) restrict opportunities for PWID to engage in care. Participants also described how strained and compartmentalized health services are onerous to navigate for patients. Second, participants described opportunities for improving HCV-related care through various structural interventions (e.g., improved housing, decriminalization of substance use), and enhanced and more accessible models of care (e.g., decentralized, integrated, outreach-focused, and peer- and nurse-led services). CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize that several key service delivery and system-level adaptations are required in order to equitably scale up access of DAAs to PWID living with HCV, including policies and programs that are responsive to socio-structural determinants of health.

"People living with HIV who spontaneously control the virus without antiretroviral treatment are called HIV Controllers and their status places them at the limits of bio-clinical normality. The objective of this study was to investigate an unexplored field: HIV Controllers' quality of life (QOL). Using quantitative methods, we compared the QOL of untreated (by definition) HIV Controllers in the ANRS CO18 HIV Controller cohort study, with the QOL of treated patients in the French national survey ANRS VESPA 2. In particular, the physical, social, mental and sexual dimensions of QOL were examined. Results highlight that perceiving oneself to be ill or healthy is linked to stigma and to a lack of self-identification with a social group. Some components of the QOL were significantly impaired in HIV controllers. This study is the first to investigate this field.

"Little is known whether and to what extent antiparasitic treatment cures female genital schistosomiasis (FGS). Using a standard protocol, of twenty-one women with FGS nine were re-examined at two to nine weeks after they had been treated with praziquantel at a single dose of 40 mg/kg. Symptoms related to pathology of the urinary tract and to a lesser extent of genital pathology subsided in most patients. Schistosoma haematobium ova were no longer detectable in urine of any of the patients post-treatment. Efficiency of chemotherapy against adult worms was confirmed by the disappearance of circulating anodic antigen (CAA) in serum. Sandy patches showed resolution in two of four cases after chemotherapy. Papillomata due to schistosomiasis alone improved, but persisted in mixed infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) or when HPV was the only underlying cause. In one patient ulcera could not be related with certainty to schistosomiasis at admission, but resolved after treatment with parziquantel. Leukoplakia (two cases) was not influenced by chemotherapy, or even increased during follow-up, regardless of whether ova had been detected or not. Although the follow-up period was rather short, time intervals were not standardized, and a relatively small number of patients was investigated, it could be shown that genital pathology due to sequestered S. haematobium ova is, at least partially, reversible already two to nine weeks after killing the adult worms by praziquantel. This is paralleled by a normalization of inflammatory immune responses detectable in histological sections and vaginal lavage.

"Cowpox virus (Brighton Red strain) possesses one of the largest genomes in the Orthopoxvirus genus. Sequence analysis of a region of the genome that is type-specific for cowpox virus identified a gene, vCD30, encoding a soluble, secreted protein that is the fifth member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family known to be encoded by cowpox virus. The vCD30 protein contains 110 aa, including a 21-residue signal peptide, a potential O-linked glycosylation site, and a 58-aa sequence sharing 51-59% identity with highly conserved extracellular segments of both mouse and human CD30. A vCD30Fc fusion protein binds CD153 (CD30 ligand) specifically, and it completely inhibits CD153/CD30 interactions. Although the functions of CD30 are not well understood, the existence of vCD30 suggests that the cellular receptor plays a significant role in normal immune responses. Viral inhibition of CD30 also lends support to the potential therapeutic value of targeting CD30 in human inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

"To determine whether Borrelia burgdorferi was enzootic within the United States at the beginning of the 20th century, ear skin samples taken from museum specimens of the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) were examined for evidence of spirochetal DNA. In total, 280 samples from mice collected between 1870 and 1919 were analyzed by a nested polymerase chain reaction protocol. Of these, 2 specimens from the vicinity of Dennis, Massachusetts, during 1894 were reproducibly positive for B. burgdorferi OspA sequences. The remaining 278, representing both currently endemic and nonendemic sites, were negative for spirochetal DNA. These studies suggest that the agent of Lyme disease was present in a suitable reservoir host in the United States before the turn of the century and provide evidence against a hypothesis of recent introduction of this zoonotic agent to North America.

"The Sleeping Beauty transposon is a recently developed non-viral vector that can mediate insertion of transgenes into the mammalian genome. Foreign DNA elements that are introduced tend to invoke a host-defense mechanism resulting in epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation, which may induce transcriptional inactivation of mammalian genes. To assess potential epigenetic modifications associated with Sleeping Beauty transposition, we investigated the DNA methylation pattern of transgenes inserted into the mouse genome as well as genomic regions flanking the insertion sites with bisulfite-mediated genomic sequencing. Transgenic mouse lines were created with two different Sleeping Beauty transposons carrying either the Agouti or eGFP transgene. Our results showed that DNA methylation in the keratin-14 promoter and Agouti transgene were negligible. In addition, two different genomic loci flanking the Agouti insertion site exhibited patterns of DNA methylation similar to wild-type mice. In contrast, high levels of DNA methylation were observed in the eGFP transgene and its ROSA26 promoter. These results indicate that transposition via Sleeping Beauty into the mouse genome may result in a significant level of de novo DNA methylation. This may depend on a number of different factors including the cargo DNA sequence, chromosomal context of the insertion site, and/or host genetic background.

"Recent clinical data indicates that the emergence of mutant drug-resistant kinase alleles may be particularly relevant for targeted kinase inhibitors. In order to explore how different classes of targeted therapies impact upon resistance mutations, we performed EGFR (epidermal-growth-factor receptor) resistance mutation screens with erlotinib, lapatinib and CI-1033. Distinct mutation spectra were generated with each inhibitor and were reflective of their respective mechanisms of action. Lapatinib yielded the widest variety of mutations, whereas mutational variability was lower in the erlotinib and CI-1033 screens. Lapatinib was uniquely sensitive to mutations of residues located deep within the selectivity pocket, whereas mutation of either Gly(796) or Cys(797) resulted in a dramatic loss of CI-1033 potency. The clinically observed T790M mutation was common to all inhibitors, but occurred with varying frequencies. Importantly, the presence of C797S with T790M in the same EGFR allele conferred complete resistance to erlotinib, lapatinib and CI-1033. The combination of erlotinib and CI-1033 effectively reduced the number of drug-resistant clones, suggesting a possible clinical strategy to overcome drug resistance. Interestingly, our results also indicate that co-expression of ErbB2 (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2) has an impact upon the EGFR resistance mutations obtained, suggesting that ErbB2 may play an active role in the acquisition of drug-resistant mutations.

"BACKGROUND: Existing tools for measuring blood-borne virus (BBV) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission risk behaviours in substance use interventions have limited capacity to assess risk behaviours across varied social, cultural and epidemiological contexts; have not evolved alongside HIV treatment and prevention innovations; or accounted for sexual contexts of drug use including among a range of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ) sub-communities. The Substance Use and Sex Index (SUSI) is a new brief, simple tool being developed to assess change in HIV and STI risk behaviours for substance use treatment studies. METHODS: A 26-item questionnaire was piloted online among community volunteers (n = 199). Concurrent and predictive validity were assessed against risk-taking (RT-18) and STI testing items (Gay Community Periodic Surveys). RESULTS: The developed scale comprised nine items measuring: condomless penile (anal or vaginal) sex, unprotected oral sex, shared toy use, bloodplay, chemsex (consumption of drugs for the facilitation of sex), trading sex for drugs, being 'too out of it' to protect self, injecting risk and group sex. Factor-analytic approaches demonstrated that items met good fit criteria for a single scale. Significant, moderate magnitude, positive relationships were identified between total SUSI score and both RT-18 risk-taking and recent STI testing. Qualitative feedback underscored the importance of culturally-embedded question formulation. CONCLUSION: The results support the conceptual basis for the instrument, highlighting the need for further scale content refinement to validate the tool and examine sensitivity to change. SUSI is a step towards improving outcome measurement of HIV/BBV/STI transmission risk behaviours in substance use treatment studies with greater inclusiveness of experiences across different population groups.

"In this article I discuss the definition of ""the Antivaccine Movement"" using the case of the French controversy over the safety of the 2009 pandemic flu vaccine. I show that the group of main actors who criticized the vaccine's safety is heterogeneous. This heterogeneity can be found in the type of arguments mobilized to question the vaccine's safety and in these actors' likelihood of being involved in any vaccine-related controversies. I show that only a minority of these actors rejected vaccination in general and mobilized against all vaccination campaigns. Most of these actors only occasionally mobilized against a given vaccine or vaccination campaign and they did so to promote a political or cultural agenda that went beyond the vaccine itself. Using these results, I argue that in order to better understand how vaccine-related controversies emerge and why some activists devote time and resources to spread vaccine-critical arguments, social scientists should use three distinct concepts to refer to vaccine criticism: The Antivaccine Movement, the Marginally Antivaccine Movements and the Occasionally Vaccine Critical Movements. To do so would enable social scientists and public health experts to better understand the different ways in which vaccination can become politicized and the evolution of this politicization.

"Emergent diseases may alter the structure and functioning of ecosystems by creating new biotic interactions and modifying existing ones, producing cascading processes along trophic webs. Recently, a new variant of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV2 or RHDVb) arguably caused widespread declines in a keystone prey in Mediterranean ecosystems - the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We quantitatively assess the impact of RHDV2 on natural rabbit populations and in two endangered apex predator populations: the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) and the Spanish Imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti). We found 60-70% declines in rabbit populations, followed by decreases of 65.7% in Iberian lynx and 45.5% in Spanish Imperial eagle fecundities. A revision of the web of trophic interactions among rabbits and their dependent predators suggests that RHDV2 acts as a keystone species, and may steer Mediterranean ecosystems to management-dependent alternative states, dominated by simplified mesopredator communities. This model system stresses the importance of diseases as functional players in the dynamics of trophic webs.

"Certain neurotropic viruses can invade the nervous system of their hosts and spread in chains of synaptically connected neurons. Consequently, it is possible to identify entire hierarchically connected circuits within an animal. In this review, we discuss the use of neurotropic herpesviruses as neuronal tract tracers. Although a variety of tract tracing viruses are available, each with its own unique infection characteristics, we focus on the widespread use of attenuated strains of pseudorabies virus (PRV), a swine herpesvirus with a broad host range. In particular, we focus on new applications of PRV for tract tracing including use of multiple infections by PRV reporter viruses to test for circuit convergence/divergence within the same animal. We provide examples of these combined application techniques within the context of an animal model to study the naturally occurring reversal of seasonal obesity in Siberian hamsters.

"The emergence of the unique H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009 resulted in a pandemic that has spread to over 200 countries. The constellation of molecular factors leading to the emergence of this strain is still unclear. Using a computational approach, we identified molecular determinants that may discriminate the hemagglutinin protein of the 2009 human pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) strain from that of other H1N1 strains. As expected, positions discriminating the pH1N1 from seasonal human strains were located in or near known H1N1 antigenic sites, thus camouflaging the pH1N1 strain from immune recognition. For example, the alteration S145K (an antigenic position) was found as a characteristic of the pH1N1 strain. We also detected positions in the hemagglutinin protein differentiating classical swine viruses from pH1N1. These positions were mostly located in and around the receptor-binding pocket, possibly influencing binding affinity to the human cell. Such alterations may be liable in part for the virus's efficient infection and adaptation to humans. For instance, 133(A) and 149 were identified as discriminative positions. Significantly, we showed that the substitutions R133(A)K and R149K, predicted to be pH1N1 characteristics, each altered virus binding to erythrocytes and conferred virulence to A/swine/NC/18161/02 in mice, reinforcing the computational findings. Our findings provide a structural explanation for the deficient immunity of humans to the pH1N1 strain. Moreover, our analysis points to unique molecular factors that may have facilitated the emergence of this swine variant in humans, in contrast to other swine variants that failed.

"A greater knowledge of the ecology of the natural foci of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is essential to better assess the temporal variations of the risk of tick-borne encephalitis for humans. To describe the seasonal and inter-annual variations of the TBEV-cycle and the epidemiological parameters related to TBEV nymph-to-larva transmission, exposure of small mammals to TBEV, and tick aggregation on small mammals, a longitudinal survey in ticks and small mammals was conducted over a 3-year period in a mountain forest in Alsace, eastern France. TBEV prevalence in questing nymphs was lower in 2013 than in 2012 and 2014, probably because small mammals (Myodes glareolus and Apodemus flavicollis) were more abundant in 2012, which reduced tick aggregation and co-feeding transmission between ticks. The prevalence of TBEV in questing nymphs was higher in autumn than spring. Despite these variations in prevalence, the density of infected questing nymphs was constant over time, leading to a constant risk for humans. The seroprevalence of small mammals was also constant over time, although the proportion of rodents infested with ticks varied between years and seasons. Our results draw attention to the importance of considering the complex relationship between small mammal densities, tick aggregation on small mammals, density of infected questing nymphs, and prevalence of infected nymphs in order to forecast the risk of TBEV for humans.

"Considerable effort is being made to design anti-viral drugs for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection process. Some of this work has focused on CD4 protein, the HIV-1 receptor on T helper lymphocytes. One drug that binds to CD4 protein and inhibits both viral infection and growth is DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate). DIDS is best known for its ability to inhibit erythrocyte band 3 anion exchange. Although the antiviral potency of DIDS is evident in vitro (IC50 approximately 30 microM), intravenous administration of DIDS should not be effective owing to the large number of band 3 molecules present on the red blood cell membrane (approximately 10(6)/cell), and to the very small Kd for DIDS binding to band 3 (approximately 30 nM). Therefore, we sought to identify other anion transport inhibitors that would bind weakly to band 3, but tightly to CD4 protein, and that could be administered to humans without significant toxic side effects. On the basis of our previous work with band 3 (Salhany, J. M., Rauenbuehler, P. B., and Sloan, R. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15965-15973), we elected to study the binding of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) to soluble CD4 protein. We have discovered that PLP binds surprisingly tightly to soluble CD4 protein (Kd = 45 microM), with a stoichiometry of about 1 mol of PLP/mol of protein. Furthermore, PLP binding was found to be competitive with DIDS for its binding site on soluble CD4 protein. These results suggest that PLP may be an effective anti-viral agent for the HIV-1 infection process.

"Serological data on myxoma virus, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) virus and RHD-like viruses in juvenile rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) trapped in 1995, 1996 and 1997 in two areas of France were analysed. For each disease, the effects of bodyweight, year, month and seropositivity for the other disease were modelled by using logistic regressions. In one area, a model including RHD seropositivity was selected to explain the myxoma virus seropositivity. Models including myxoma virus seropositivity were selected to explain the RHD seropositivity in both areas, and the odds of a rabbit being seropositive to both viruses were 5.1 and 8.4 times higher than the odds of a rabbit being seronegative to myxoma virus and seropositive to RHD. The year and bodyweight had significant effects for myxomatosis in one area and for RHD in both areas.

"Different pigmentation genes have been associated with color diversity in domestic animal species. The melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), agouti signaling protein (ASIP), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) genes are candidate genes responsible for variation in wool color among breeds of sheep. Although the influence of these genes has been described in some breeds, in many others the effect of interactions among genes underlying wool color has not been investigated. The Brazilian Creole sheep is a local breed with a wide variety of wool color, ranging from black to white with several intermediate hues. We analyzed in this study the influence of the genes MC1R, ASIP, TYRP1, and KIT on the control of wool color in this breed. A total of 410 samples were analyzed, including 148 white and 262 colored individuals. The MC1R and ASIP polymorphisms were significantly associated with the segregation of either white or colored wool. The dominant MC1R allele (E(D) p.M73K and p.D121N) was present only in colored animals. All white individuals were homozygous for the MC1R recessive allele (E(+)) and carriers of the duplicated copy of ASIP A gene expression assay showed that only the carrier of the duplicated copy of ASIP produces increased levels in skin, not detectable in the single homozygous copy. These results demonstrate that the epistatic interaction of the genotypes in the MC1R and ASIP gene is responsible for the striking color variation in the Creole breed.

"Influenza vaccine production technology based on large scale cell culture technology has been developed. From the characterization of the continuous cell line MDCK as well as drug safety studies we conclude that this cell line and the cell culture system are suitable for biological production. The Down Stream Process (DSP) of the virus-containing harvest fluids guarantees sufficient inactivation of influenza viruses and adequate removal or inactivation of putative adventitious or endogenous viruses, mycoplasma or bacteria. Our data indicate that the tissue culture-based production technology is feasible.

"The human genome carries multiple copies of sequences related to endogenous retroviral genomes that include long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. We used the LTR of one such viral genome, called HERV-A, as a probe in Southern analysis to examine the distribution profiles of the hybridizing DNA in the genomes of twelve human x rodent hybrid cell lines carrying one or a few human chromosomes, and in the DNA samples prepared from six sorted, individual chromosomes. The HERV-A sequence was found to be widely distributed among different chromosomes and the Southern patterns for chromosomes 5, the X, and the Y, each obtained in duplicate from independently prepared cell lines or sorted chromosomes, were matched. Chromosome-specific Southern profiles can be used to monitor chromosomes in hybrid cells or to characterize chromosome aberrations, such as deletions.

"Aflatoxins and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in South-east Asia and Africa, parts of the world where this cancer is most prevalent. Exposure to both factors is endemic, occurring from early in life. There is evidence from both epidemiological studies and animal models that the two factors can act synergistically to increase the risk of HCC, but the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of interaction are as yet undefined. One possibility suggested by studies in HBV transgenic mice is that chronic liver injury alters the expression of carcinogen metabolizing enzymes, thus modulating the level of binding of aflatoxin to DNA. Primary prevention of HCC in high incidence areas of the world should primarily be focused on provision of the safe, effective vaccine against HBV. However, measures to reduce the high levels of aflatoxin exposure, where chronic HBV infection is currently epidemic, would also significantly contribute to reducing HCC incidence. In Guinea-Conakry, West Africa, surveys of HBV infection and aflatoxin exposure have established baseline data for the implementation of a community-based intervention study. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of improving the post-harvest processing and storage of the groundnut crop, a major source of aflatoxins, using aflatoxin-albumin adducts as the outcome measurement.

"Polyarginine-containing peptides represent potent inhibitors of furin, a mammalian endoprotease that plays an important role in metabolism, activation of pathogenic toxins, and viral proliferation. The therapeutic use of D-polyarginines is especially interesting because they are not cleaved by furin and possess inhibitory potency almost equal to L-polyarginines. In this study we attempted to determine the important elements within polyarginines that contribute to effective inhibition. Structure-function analyses of polyarginine peptides showed that inhibition by polyarginine-containing peptides appeared to depend on the total number of basic charges of the positively charged inhibitors bound to the negatively charged substrate binding pocket; peptide positioning did not appear to be rigorously determined. Screening of L- and D-decapeptide positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries indicated a preference for basic residues in nearly all positions, similar to previous results with hexapeptide libraries. Length and terminal modification studies showed that the most potent D-polyarginine tested was nona-D-arginine (D9R) amide with a K(i) of 1.3 nm. D9R amide was shown to protect RAW264.7 cells against anthrax toxemia with an IC(50) of 3.7 microm. Because of its high stability, specificity, low toxicity, small molecular weight, and extremely low K(i) against furin, D9R amide or its derivatives may represent promising compounds for therapeutic use.

"Puumala hantavirus is the most common hantavirus infection in Western Europe. The causative agent, Puumala virus, is a member of the Hantavirus genus in the Bunyaviridae family. The natural hosts of hantaviruses are chronically, but asymptomatic infected rodents, which transmit the virus to human in their excretions. Puumala virus is carried by the bank vole, clethrionomys glareolus. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) caused by Puumala virus in France or Belgium is very similar to the previously described Nephropathia epidemica in Scandinavia. In most severe cases, the disease is clinically characterized by high fever of abrupt onset, headache, loin or abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting, and occasionally acute and transient myopia. Renal involvement results in transient proteinuria and hematuria and acute renal failure. Except for interstitial hemorrhage in the outer medulla, the renal histopathologic findings are unspecific and include prominent changes in the interstitium with interstitial oedema and inflammatory infiltrates. Thrombocytopenia, mild elevation of liver enzymes, and leukocytosis are typical laboratory findings. Spontaneous complete recovery is the rule. Laboratory diagnosis is primarily based on serology such as indirect immunofluorescence or capture enzyme--linked immunosorbent assays which detect IgM antibodies and an increased level of IgG antibodies against Puumala virus. Viral antigen may be demonstrated in the cytoplasm of renal tubular epithelial cells.

"Four independent clones of RSV-transformed Chinese hamster fibroblasts were isolated. Southern blots and dot hybridization studies showed that in three out of four clones there were four to eight times as many integrated proviruses as in the fourth clone which contained at least one complete provirus. Restriction mapping studies showed that although the integration site varied from clone to clone, all the proviral copies in the same clone shared the same flanking cellular sequences. In one clone there are at least two polymorphic proviral variants A and B, one with and one without a BglI site. Further experiments were performed to see if the variants could be physically separated. RSV-Transformed Chinese hamster cells resistant to thioguanine were fused with mouse cells to give somatic hybrids which preferentially segregate Chinese hamster chromosomes. Ten out of eleven hybrids positive for virus rescue have lost up to 90% of the parental provirus copies. Four of these hybrids were found to contain the provirus variant A alone, one the variant B alone, and the rest contained both variants. All the proviruses retained in somatic hybrids shared the flanking cellular sequences of the parental provirus. Provirus segregation in somatic hybrids confirms that multiple (about ten) copies of the provirus region are present in the karyotype of parental RSV-transformed cells and, furthermore, suggests that the amplified copies of this region are translocated to different chromosomes.

"The alpha-herpes virus (pseudorabies, PRV) was used to observe central nervous system (CNS) pathways associated with the vestibulocerebellar system. Retrograde transneuronal migration of alpha-herpes virions from specific lobules of the gerbil and rat vestibulo-cerebellar cortex was detected immunohistochemically. Using a time series analysis, progression of infection along polyneuronal cerebellar afferent pathways was examined. Pressure injections of > 20 nanoliters of a 10(8) plaque forming units (pfu) per ml solution of virus were sufficient to initiate an infectious locus which resulted in labeled neurons in the inferior olivary subnuclei, vestibular nuclei, and their afferent cell groups in a progressive temporal fashion and in growing complexity with increasing incubation time. We show that climbing fibers and some other cerebellar afferent fibers transported the virus retrogradely from the cerebellum within 24 hours. One to three days after cerebellar infection discrete cell groups were labeled and appropriate laterality within crossed projections was preserved. Subsequent nuclei labeled with PRV after infection of the flocculus/paraflocculus, or nodulus/uvula, included the following: vestibular (e.g., z) and inferior olivary nuclei (e.g., dorsal cap), accessory oculomotor (e.g., Darkschewitsch n.) and accessory optic related nuclei, (e.g., the nucleus of the optic tract, and the medial terminal nucleus); noradrenergic, raphe, and reticular cell groups (e.g., locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, raphe pontis, and the lateral reticular tract); other vestibulocerebellum sites, the periaqueductal gray, substantia nigra, hippocampus, thalamus and hypothalamus, amygdala, septal nuclei, and the frontal, cingulate, entorhinal, perirhinal, and insular cortices. However, there were differences in the resulting labeling between infection in either region. Double-labeling experiments revealed that vestibular efferent neurons are located adjacent to, but are not included among, flocculus-projecting supragenual neurons. PRV transport from the vestibular labyrinth and cervical muscles also resulted in CNS infections. Virus propagation in situ provides specific connectivity information based on the functional transport across synapses. The findings support and extend anatomical data regarding vestibulo-olivo-cerebellar pathways.

"Detailed knowledge about hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination coverage and timeliness for sub-Saharan Africa is scarce. We used data from a community-based cross-sectional survey conducted in 2018-2019 in the area of Niakhar, Senegal, to estimate coverage, timeliness, and factors associated with non-adherence to the World Health Organisation-recommended vaccination schedules in children born in 2016 (year of the birth dose (BD) introduction in Senegal) and 2017-2018. Vaccination status was assessed from vaccination cards, surveillance data, and healthcare post vaccination records. Among 241 children with available data, for 2016 and 2017-2018, respectively, 31.0% and 66.8% received the BD within 24 h of birth (BD schedule), and 24.3% and 53.7% received the BD plus at least two pentavalent vaccine doses within the recommended timeframes (three-dose schedule). In logistic regression models, home birth, dry season birth, and birth in 2016 were all associated with non-adherence to the recommended BD and three-dose schedules. Living over three kilometres from the nearest healthcare post, being the firstborn, and living in an agriculturally poorer household were only associated with non-adherence to the three-dose schedule. The substantial proportion of children not vaccinated according to recommended schedules highlights the importance of considering vaccination timeliness when evaluating vaccination programme effectiveness. Outreach vaccination activities and incentives to bring children born at home to healthcare facilities within 24 h of birth, must be strengthened to improve timely HBV vaccination.

"BACKGROUND: The oncogenic Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation was reported to be the signature genetic event in most cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Hepassocin (HPS/FGL1) is involved in regulating lipid metabolism and the progression of several cancer types; however, the underlying mechanism of HPS/FGL1 in the KRAS mutant PDAC cells undergoing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) treatment remains unclear. METHODS: We measured HPS/FGL1 protein expressions in a human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPNE) normal pancreas cell line, a KRAS-wild-type PDAC cell line (BxPC-3), and KRAS-mutant PDAC cell lines (PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and SUIT-2) by Western blot methods. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with corresponding KRAS-expressing plasmids to examine the level of HPS expression with KRAS activation. We knocked-down HPS/FGL1 using lentiviral vectors in SUIT-2 cells and measured the cell viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and clonogenicity assays. Furthermore, a lipidomic analysis was performed to profile changes in lipid metabolism after HPS/FGL1 knockdown. RESULTS: We found that the HPS/FGL1 level was significantly upregulated in KRAS-mutated PDAC cells and was involved in KRAS/phosphorylated (p)-signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling, and the knockdown of HPS/FGL1 in SUIT-2 cells decreased cell proliferation through increasing G(2)/M cell cycle arrest and cyclin B1 expression. In addition, the knockdown of HPS/FGL1 in SUIT-2 cells significantly increased omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and EPA production but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Moreover, EPA treatment in SUIT-2 cells reduced the expression of de novo lipogenic protein, acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)-1, and decreased p-STAT3 and HPS/FGL1 expressions, resulting in the suppression of cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study indicate that HPS is highly expressed by KRAS-mutated PDAC cells, and HPS/FGL1 plays a crucial role in altering lipid metabolism and increasing cell growth in pancreatic cancer. EPA supplements could potentially inhibit or reduce ACC-1-involved lipogenesis and HPS/FGL1-mediated cell survival in KRAS-mutated pancreatic cancer cells.

"Diarylpyrimidine derivatives (DAPYs) exhibit robust anti-HIV-1 potency, although they have been compromised by E138K variant and severe side-effects and been suffering from poor water solubility. In the present work, hydrophilic morpholine or methylsulfonyl and sulfamide-substituted piperazine/piperidines were introduced into the right wing of DAPYs targeting the solvent-exposed tolerant region I. The anti-HIV-1 activities of 11c (EC(50(WT)) = 0.0035 μM, EC(50(E138K)) = 0.0075 μM) were the same as and 2-fold better than that of the lead etravirine against the wild-type and E138K mutant HIV-1, respectively, with a relative low cytotoxicity (CC(50) ≥ 173 μM). Further test showed a significant improvement in the water solubility of 11c. Besides, 11c displayed no significant inhibition on main cytochrome P450 enzymes and exhibited no acute/subacute toxicities at doses of 2000 mg·kg(-1)/50 mg·kg(-1) in mice. Taken together, we consider that 11c is a promising lead for further structural optimization.

"Mortality among individuals co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is relatively high. We evaluated the association between psychoactive substance use and both HCV and non-HCV mortality in HIV/HCV co-infected patients in France, using Fine and Gray's competing-risk model adjusted for socio-demographic, clinical predictors and confounding factors, while accounting for competing causes of death. Over a 5-year median follow-up period, 77 deaths occurred among 1028 patients. Regular/daily cannabis use, elevated coffee intake, and not currently smoking were independently associated with reduced HCV-mortality (adjusted sub-hazard ratio [95% CI] 0.28 [0.10-0.83], 0.38 [0.15-0.95], and 0.28 [0.10-0.79], respectively). Obesity and severe thinness were associated with increased HCV-mortality (2.44 [1.00-5.93] and 7.25 [2.22-23.6] versus normal weight, respectively). Regular binge drinking was associated with increased non-HCV-mortality (2.19 [1.10-4.37]). Further research is needed to understand the causal mechanisms involved. People living with HIV/HCV co-infection should be referred for tobacco, alcohol and weight control interventions and potential benefits of cannabis-based therapies investigated.

"The 3'-untranslated region of the Sindbis virus genome is 0.3 kb in length with a 19-nucleotide conserved sequence element (3' CSE) immediately preceding the 3'-poly(A) tail. The 3' CSE and poly(A) tail have been assumed to constitute the core promoter for minus-strand RNA synthesis during genome replication; however, their involvement in this process has not been formally demonstrated. Utilizing both in vitro and in vivo analyses, we have examined the role of these elements in the initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis. The major findings of this study with regard to efficient minus-strand RNA synthesis are the following: (i) the wild-type 3' CSE and the poly(A) tail are required, (ii) the poly(A) tail must be a minimum of 11 to 12 residues in length and immediately follow the 3' CSE, (iii) deletion or substitution of the 3' 13 nucleotides of the 3' CSE severely inhibits minus-strand RNA synthesis, (iv) templates possessing non-wild-type 3' sequences previously demonstrated to support virus replication do not program efficient RNA synthesis, and (v) insertion of uridylate residues between the poly(A) tail and a non-wild-type 3' sequence can restore promoter function to a limited extent. This study shows that the optimal structure of the 3' component of the minus-strand promoter is the wild-type 3' CSE followed a poly(A) tail of at least 11 residues. Our findings also show that insertion of nontemplated bases can restore function to an inactive promoter.

"The increased risk of heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) has prompted the search for safe and effective female-controlled vaginal microbicides. Because endogenous reverse transcription is implicated in augmenting the sexual transmission of HIV-1, potential microbicides should have the inherent ability to optimally inhibit both wild-type and drug-resistant mutant strains of HIV-1. N-[2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenylethyl)]-N'-[2-(5-bromopyridyl)]-thiourea (PHI-236) is a rationally designed non-nucleoside inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (NNRTI) that was deduced from changes in binding pocket size, shape and residue character that result from clinically observed NNRTI resistance mutations. PHI-236 displayed high-binding affinity (Ludi K(i) = 0.07 microM) for HIV-1 RT and robust anti-HIV activity against the wild type (IC50 = <0.001 microM) as well as primary clinical isolates (IC50 = 0.009-0.04 microM) carrying multiple RT gene mutations associated with NRTI and NNRTI resistance. PHI-236 displayed high-selectivity index against human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells and did not affect human sperm functions. In the humanized severe combined immunodeficient mouse model for HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), pretreatment of HIV-1 (BaL)-infected human monocytes and semen with PHI-236 prevented the systemic infection via the vaginal route. PHI-236 has particular clinical utility as a non-spermicidal microbicide as well as a prophylactic antiviral agent to inactivate cell-free and cell-associated HIV-1 in semen before assisted reproductive technology procedures.

"Bed bugs, Cimex lectularius, irradiated with gamma rays were allowed to suck blood from shaved areas of the skin of rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, 2 times/week for 5 months and then once weekly for another 5 months. This significantly induced the formation of skin papillomas and sweat gland hyperplasia in five out of nine experimental animals. It is speculated that the saliva of the irradiated bugs was activated by gamma rays and was responsible for the induction of skin papillomas. Because bed bugs play a significant role in the transmission of virus, it is also speculated that there is a virus in the saliva of bugs; this virus may be activated by gamma radiation and causes the development of papillomas in the skin.

"BACKGROUND: Interferon- and ribavirin (RBV)-free regimens can improve patient-reported outcomes (PROs) during treatment. AIM: To compare PROs during treatment with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) to placebo and to LDV/SOF + RBV. METHODS: Treatment-experienced CH-C genotype 1 patients with compensated cirrhosis (N = 154) were randomized to receive 24 weeks of LDV/SOF or 12 weeks of placebo followed by 12 weeks of LDV/SOF + RBV (the SIRIUS clinical trial). While blinded to their HCV RNA level and study treatment, patients completed PRO questionnaires (SF-36, FACIT-F, CLDQ-HCV, WPAI:SHP) at baseline, during and post-treatment. RESULTS: Baseline PRO scores were similar between the two study arms. Patients receiving LDV/SOF showed improvement in a number of PROs (predominantly related to mental health) starting as early as 4 weeks after treatment initiation; no PRO decrement from baseline were noted, and no PRO scores were inferior to placebo (all P > 0.05). In the second 12 weeks, patients who were receiving LDV/SOF continued to improve PROs (up to +9.2% from a 100% maximum possible score, P < 0.05), while patients receiving LDV/SOF + RBV had less gains or no improvement in their PRO scores. However, regardless of the regimen, patients who successfully cleared the virus (N = 149) had significant improvement in all aspects of PROs (up to +12.2% by post-treatment week 12, up to +16.9% by week 24). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment-experienced cirrhotic patients experience a notable improvement of their PROs during treatment with LDV/SOF. Furthermore, achieving SVR-12 is associated with significant PRO improvement, which further improves at post-treatment week 24 in this difficult to treat group of patients with chronic hepatitis C.

"Lentiviral vectors are promising as gene-transfer vehicles for gene therapy targeted to intractable brain diseases. Although lentiviral vectors are thought to exert little toxicity on infected cells, the adverse influence of viral infection on vulnerable developing neurons has not been well studied. Here, we examined whether lentiviral vector infection and subsequent transgene expression affected the morphological and functional maturation of vigorously developing cerebellar Purkinje cells in vivo. Lentiviral vectors expressing GFP under the control of the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) promoter were injected into the cerebellar cortex of neonatal rat pups. Three weeks after treatment, GFP-expressing Purkinje cells were compared with control Purkinje cells from phosphate-buffered saline-injected rats. Analysis of the dendritic tree showed that total dendrite length in GFP-expressing Purkinje cells was almost 80% that in control Purkinje cells. Electrophysiological examination showed that short-term synaptic plasticity at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and climbing fiber-Purkinje cell synapses was significantly altered in GFP-expressing Purkinje cells. In contrast, maldevelopment of infected Purkinje cells was substantially attenuated when lentiviral vectors with much weaker promoter activity were used. These results suggest that the maldevelopment of Purkinje cells was mainly caused by subsequent expression of a high amount of GFP driven by the strong MSCV promoter. Thus, the use of lentiviral vectors carrying a strong promoter may require particular precautions when applying them to neurological disorders of infants.

"Flaviviruses are emerging arthropod-borne viruses posing a great threat to human beings worldwide. The E dimer configuration of the flavivirus was prominent during viral assembly, maturation and entry. Neutralization antibodies targeting E dimer played the important role in controlling the flavivirus infection. Previously, the ideal drug target of small molecular inhibitors of JEV was viral proteases and polymerases. The crystal structure of JEV E protein showed a conserved pocket in it is important at membrane fusion step. Recently, a set of anti-virus drugs has been found by virtual screening. Here, we show that the fusion-loop pocket of JEV E protein was a conservative region and an ideal drug target. ChemDiv-3 from virtual screening as the lead compound was found to show a relatively modest inhibition effect for JEV in vitro and in vivo test and could interfere with the formation of JEV sE dimer. ChemDiv-3 interacts with the amino acid residues ASN 313, PRO 314, ALA 315, and VAL 323 in E protein via hydrogen bonds for occupation of the fusion-loop pocket. The key binding sites LYS 312, ALA 513 and THR 317 forming the fusion-loop pocket are the same and other auxiliary sites are similar among the flavivirus. Taken together, the fusion-loop pocket of the flavivirus could be one promising target for drug discovery.

"The poxviruses have evolved a diverse array of proteins which serve to subvert innate and adaptive host responses that abort or at least limit viral infections. Myxoma virus and its rabbit host are considered to represent an ideal poxvirus-host system in which to study the effects of these immunomodulatory proteins. Studies of laboratory rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) infected with gene knockout variants of myxoma virus have provided compelling evidence that several myxoma virus gene products contribute to the pathogenic condition known as myxomatosis. However, myxomatosis, which is characterized by skin lesions, systemic immunosuppression, and a high mortality rate, does not occur in the virus' natural South American host, Sylvilogus brasiliensis. Moreover, in Australia where myxoma virus was willfully introduced to control populations of O. cuniculus, myxomatosis-resistant rabbits emerged within a year of myxoma virus introduction into the field. In this review I discuss the characterized immunomodulatory proteins of myxoma virus, their biochemical properties, their pathogenic effects in laboratory rabbits, the role of the host immune system in the susceptibility or resistance to myxomatosis, and the evidence that immunomodulatory genes may have been attenuated during the co-adaptation of myxoma virus and O. cuniculus in Australia.

"Collagen lysyl hydroxylases (LH1-3) are Fe(2+)- and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent oxygenases that maintain extracellular matrix homeostasis. High LH2 levels cause stable collagen cross-link accumulations that promote fibrosis and cancer progression. However, developing LH antagonists will require structural insights. Here, we report a 2 Å crystal structure and X-ray scattering on dimer assemblies for the LH domain of L230 in Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus. Loop residues in the double-stranded β-helix core generate a tail-to-tail dimer. A stabilizing hydrophobic leucine locks into an aromatic tyrosine-pocket on the opposite subunit. An active site triad coordinates Fe(2+). The two active sites flank a deep surface cleft that suggest dimerization creates a collagen-binding site. Loss of Fe(2+)-binding disrupts the dimer. Dimer disruption and charge reversal in the cleft increase K(m) and reduce LH activity. Ectopic L230 expression in tumors promotes collagen cross-linking and metastasis. These insights suggest inhibitor targets for fibrosis and cancer.

"Gadd34 (also known as MyD116) was originally described as a growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene. Increased expression of Gadd34 was subsequently found to correlate with apoptosis, and forced overexpression of the protein leads to apoptosis. Gadd34 protein modulates protein phosphatase type 1 activity through both direct binding to the protein, as well as through binding to other proteins that also modulate phosphatase activity. In addition, Gadd34 has a region of homology with the herpes simplex virus type 1 ICP34.5 protein that is involved in the prevention of apoptosis in infected cells. Recently it was reported that a novel rat Gadd34-related gene, PEG-3, was upregulated in transformed cells, and that forced expression of this gene led to increased tumorigenic potential of cells implanted into nude mice and increased angiogenesis of these tumors. We have found, however, that PEG-3 does not exist in normal rat cells, which have a single diploid complement of Gadd34. Sequence analysis of the rat Gadd34 gene and comparison with PEG-3 indicates that PEG-3 is most likely a mutant of Gadd34 that perhaps arose as a result of transformation. This finding suggests that truncated Gadd34 may interfere with normal Gadd34 function in transfected cells. However, human Gadd34 lacking the viral homology domain does not interfere with normal Gadd34-induced apoptosis in cultured cells. This suggests that viral similarity sequences may be required for Gadd34-mediated functions other than apoptosis.

"River bank or slow sand filtration is a major procedure for processing surface water to drinking water in central europe. In order to model the performance of river bank and slow sand filtration plants, we are studying the different mechanisms by which the elimination of pathogens is realized. An important question concerning the mode of action of slow sand filters and river bank filtration units is the role of the colmation layer or ""schmutzdecke"" on the elimination of human pathogens. The schmutzdecke is an organic layer which develops at the surface of the sand filter short after the onset of operation. We have inoculated a pilot plant for slow sand filtration with coliphages and determined their rate of breakthrough and their final elimination. In the first experiment, with a colmation layer still missing, the breakthrough of the coliphages in the 80 cm mighty sandy bed amounted to ca. 40 %. In contrast, less than 1 % of coliphages escaped from the filter as the same experiment was repeated two months later, when a substantial colmation layer had developed. Our preliminary conclusions are that the colmation layer is extremely efficient in eliminating of viruses.

"A hallmark of neoplastic transformation by DNA tumor viruses is the deregulation of cell cycle genes. At least in some genes, this deregulation appears to be due to the oncoprotein-mediated disruption of complexes between E2F and pocket proteins and the ensuing generation of transcriptionally active free E2F. In the present study, we have analysed the effect of the SV40 large T oncoprotein (SV-LT) on the function of a different cell cycle-regulated transcriptional repressor, CDF, which is the principal regulator of the cdc25C, cyclin A and cdc2 genes. As shown by genomic footprinting of sorted G1 and G2 cell populations, transformation by SV-LT completely abrogated protection of the CDF binding site (CDE-CHR) in the cdc25C promoter. In agreement with this observation, expression of the SV-LT in fibroblasts led to a dramatic up-regulation of the cdc25C promoter in cells synchronized in G0. These findings indicate that the oncoprotein-mediated dissociation of the CDF repressor protein from its cognate DNA-binding site is a major mechanism in virus-induced transcriptional deregulation.

"A common link between the induction of leukemia by (i) fractionated doses of x-irradiation and (ii) radiation leukemia virus in mice may be established by the observation that the segment of chromosome 2 between the loci for the minor histocompatibility antigen H-30 and color coat agouti (H-30-A) includes distinct loci involved in susceptibility to leukemogenesis induced by factors i and ii.

"Atlantic salmon's (Salmo salar) annual aquaculture production exceeds 2M tonnes globally, and for the UK forms the largest single food export. However, aquaculture production is negatively affected by a range of different diseases and parasites. Effort to control pathogens should be focused on those which are most ""important"" to aquaculture. It is difficult to specify what makes a pathogen important; this is particularly true in the aquatic sector where data capture systems are less developed than for human or terrestrial animal diseases. Mortality levels might be one indicator, but these can cause a range of different problems such as persistent endemic losses, occasional large epidemics or control/treatment costs. Economic and multi-criteria decision methods can incorporate this range of impacts, however these have not been consistently applied to aquaculture and the quantity and quality of data required is large, so their potential for comparing aquatic pathogens is currently limited. A method that has been developed and applied to both human and terrestrial animal diseases is the analysis of published scientific literature using the H-index method. We applied this method to salmon pathogens using Web of Science searches for 23 pathogens. The top 3 H-indices were obtained for: sea lice, furunculosis, and infectious salmon anaemia; post 2000, Amoebic Gill Disease (AGD) replaced furunculosis. The number of publications per year describing bacterial disease declined significantly, while those for viruses and sea lice increased significantly. This reflects effective bacterial control by vaccination, while problems related to viruses and sea lice have increased. H-indices by country reflected different national concerns (e.g. AGD ranked top for Australia). Averaged national H-indices for salmon diseases tend to increase with log of salmon production; countries with H-Indices significantly below the trend line have suffered particularly large disease losses. The H-index method, supported by other literature analyses, is consistent with the nature and history of salmon diseases and so provides a useful quantitative measure for comparing different diseases in the absence of other measures.

"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, is common in Europe and Asia and causes a severe disease of the central nervous system. A promising approach in the development of therapy for TBEV infection is the search for small molecule antivirals targeting the flavivirus envelope protein E, particularly its β-n-octyl-d-glucoside binding pocket (β-OG pocket). However, experimental studies of candidate antivirals may be complicated by varying amounts and different forms of the protein E in the virus samples. Viral particles with different conformations and arrangements of the protein E are produced during the replication cycle of flaviviruses, including mature, partially mature, and immature forms, as well as subviral particles lacking genomic RNA. The immature forms are known to be abundant in the viral population. We obtained immature virion preparations of TBEV, characterized them by RT-qPCR, and assessed in vivo and in vitro infectivity of the residual mature virions in the immature virus samples. Analysis of the β-OG pocket structure on the immature virions confirmed the possibility of binding of adamantylmethyl esters of 5-aminoisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid in the pocket. We demonstrated that the antiviral activity of these compounds in plaque reduction assay is significantly reduced in the presence of immature TBEV particles.

"Microsequence analysis of peptides eluted from the murine class I H-2Kb molecule together with the three-dimensional structure of the molecule co-crystallized with a homogeneous population of peptides suggests that pocket B is a minor pocket that does not play a major role in peptide presentation. This is in contrast to most other class I molecules in which pocket B plays a central role in selecting and presenting antigenic peptides. To investigate the role of pocket B in antigen presentation by the Kb molecule, we analyzed site-directed mutants of position 45 in pocket B for their effect on both allo- and peptide-specific recognition. We made an identical set of mutations in Kbm8 at residue 45 in order to evaluate their influence in the context of a more open pocket B which results from the bm8 substitution at amino acid 24 (E-->S). We demonstrated that this minor pocket did play a significant role in the antigenicity of both molecules and that this role was more readily apparent in the context of the more open pocket B of Kbm8. In addition, we found that some substitutions of residue 45 in the Kbm8 molecule restored recognition by some alloreactive and peptide specific anti-Kb T cell clones which are normally restricted to Kb, indicating that multiple configurations of amino acids in a pocket could result in similar binding and presentation capabilities.

"BACKGROUND: In the past decade, many new paramyxoviruses that do not belong to any of the seven established genera in the family Paramyxoviridae have been discovered. Amongst them are J-virus (JPV), Beilong virus (BeiPV) and Tailam virus (TlmPV), three paramyxovirus species found in rodents. Based on their similarities, it has been suggested that these viruses should compose a new genus, tentatively called 'Jeilongvirus'. RESULTS: Here we present the complete genomes of three newly discovered paramyxoviruses, one found in a bank vole (Myodes glareolus) from Slovenia and two in a single, co-infected Rungwe brush-furred rat (Lophuromys machangui) from Mozambique, that represent three new, separate species within the putative genus 'Jeilongvirus'. The genome organization of these viruses is similar to other paramyxoviruses, but like JPV, BeiPV and TlmPV, they possess an additional open reading frame, encoding a transmembrane protein, that is located between the F and G genes. As is the case for all Jeilongviruses, the G genes of the viruses described here are unusually large, and their encoded proteins are characterized by a remarkable amino acid composition pattern that is not seen in other paramyxoviruses, but resembles certain motifs found in Orthopneumovirus G proteins. CONCLUSIONS: The phylogenetic clustering of JPV, BeiPV and TlmPV with the viruses described here, as well as their shared features that set them apart from other paramyxoviruses, provide additional support for the recognition of the genus 'Jeilongvirus'.

"AIDS is a global pandemic that has seen the development of novel and effective treatments to improve the quality of life of those infected and reduction of spread of the disease. Palmitic Acid (PA), which we identified and isolated from Sargassum fusiforme, is a naturally occurring fatty acid that specifically inhibits HIV entry by binding to a novel pocket on the CD4 receptor. We also identified a structural analogue, 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), as a more effective HIV entry inhibitor with a 20-fold increase in efficacy. We have used the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of 2-BP as a platform to identify new small chemical molecules that fit into the various identified active sites in an effort to identify more potent CD4 entry inhibitors. To validate further drug development, we tested the PA and 2-BP scaffold molecules for genotoxic potential. The FDA and International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) recommends using a standardized 3-test battery for testing compound genotoxicity consisting of the bacterial reverse mutation assay, mouse lymphoma assay, and rat micronucleus assay. PA and 2-BP and their metabolites tested negative in all three genotoxicty tests. 2-BP is the first derivative of PA to undergo pre-clinical screening, which will enable us to now test multiple simultaneous small chemical structures based on activity in scaffold modeling across the dimension of pre-clinical testing to enable transition to human testing.

"Six methods of chemically coupling proteins to red blood cells were evaluated for their effectiveness in coupling foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) to sheep red blood cells. The coupling agents tested were potassium periodate, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (ECDI), chromium chloride, glutaraldehyde, bis-diazotized benzidine (BDB) and N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP). Of these, only the coupling methods using BDB and SPDP resulted in virus-red cell complexes that reacted with FMDV antiserum in passive hemagglutination and passive immune hemolysis assays. The BDB and SPDP methods were studied further to determine optimal coupling conditions, the kinetics of coupling and the effects of chemical couplers on viral integrity. Only the FMDV-red cell complexes formed with SPDP were suitable targets for detecting FMDV antibody producing lymphocytes in a hemolytic plaque assay.

"BACKGROUND: Needlestick injuries from devices used for blood collection or for injections expose healthcare workers to the risk of blood borne infections such as hepatitis B and C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Safety features such as shields or retractable needles can possibly contribute to the prevention of these injuries and it is important to evaluate their effectiveness. OBJECTIVES: To determine the benefits and harms of safety medical devices aiming to prevent percutaneous exposure injuries caused by needles in healthcare personnel versus no intervention or alternative interventions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHSEED, Science Citation Index Expanded, CINAHL, Nioshtic, CISdoc and PsycINFO (until January 2014) and LILACS (until January 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCT), controlled before and after studies (CBA) and interrupted time-series (ITS) designs on the effect of safety engineered medical devices on needlestick injuries in healthcare staff. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted data. We synthesized study results with a fixed-effect or random-effects model meta-analysis where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We included four RCTs with 1136 participants, two cluster-RCTs with 795 participants and 73,454 patient days, four CBAs with approximately 22,000 participants and seven ITS with an average of seven data points. These studies evaluated safe modifications of blood collection systems, intravenous (IV) systems, injection systems, multiple devices and sharps containers. The needlestick injury (NSI) rate in the control groups was estimated at about one to five NSIs per 1000 person-years. There was only one study from a low- or middle-income country. The risk of bias was high in most studies.In one ITS study that evaluated safe blood collection systems, NSIs decreased immediately after the introduction (effect size (ES) -6.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) -9.5 to -4.2) and there was no clear evidence of an additional benefit over time (ES -1.2, 95% CI -2.5 to 0.1). Another ITS study used an outdated recapping shield.There was very low quality evidence that NSIs were reduced with the introduction of safe IV devices in two out of four studies but the other two studies showed no clear evidence of a trend towards a reduction. However, there was moderate quality evidence in four other studies that these devices increased the number of blood splashes where the safety system had to be engaged actively (relative risk (RR) 1.6, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.36).There was no clear evidence that the introduction of safe injection devices changed the NSI rate in two studies.The introduction of multiple safety devices showed a decrease in NSI in one study but not in another. The introduction of safety containers showed a decrease in NSI in one study but inconsistent results in two other studies.There was no evidence in the included studies about which type of device was better, for example shielding or retraction of the needle. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: For safe blood collection systems, we found very low quality evidence in one study that these decrease needlestick injuries (NSIs). For intravenous systems, we found very low quality evidence that they result in a decrease of NSI compared with usual devices but moderate quality evidence that they increase contamination with blood. For other safe injection needles, the introduction of multiple safety devices or the introduction of sharps containers the evidence was inconsistent or there was no clear evidence of a benefit. All studies had a considerable risk of bias and the lack of evidence of a beneficial effect could be due both to confounding and bias. This does not mean that these devices are not effective.Cluster-randomised controlled studies are needed to compare the various types of safety engineered devices for their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

"BACKGROUND: Health care worker vaccine uptake rates are below official targets, and studies demonstrate some are vaccine hesitant. We assessed self-vaccination behavior, vaccine hesitancy (VH), and associated factors in a representative sample of nurses. METHODS: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey in 2017-18 in southeastern France (5 million inhabitants): community nurses were randomly selected from a list provided by the Inter-Regional Nurses' Council (stratified by gender and district of practice) and interviewed by telephone. Because no such list exists for hospital nurses (74% of all nurses in southeastern France), we randomly selected hospitals, taking their size into account and stratifying by district. Hospital nurses practicing in medicine, surgery, obstetrics, and gynecology departments and present at the time of the survey were included and interviewed face-to face. We measured VH according to the WHO definition (refusal, delay, or acceptance with doubts about at least one vaccine). Interviewers administered the questionnaires. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze potential associations between VH, vaccine risk perceptions and trust in health authorities. RESULTS: Interviews were completed with 1539 nurses (response rate: 85%). Self-reported vaccine coverage ranged from 27% (seasonal influenza vaccine, recommended, 2016/17 season) to 96% (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine, mandatory). The VH prevalence rate was 44% (95% confidence interval: 38.7-48.4) and most often concerned seasonal influenza or A(H1N1) vaccines (54%) and the hepatitis B vaccine (18%). VH was significantly more frequent among nurses with low trust in health authorities or high vaccine risk perceptions. CONCLUSION: Nurses in southeastern France have low levels of self-vaccination acceptance for most recommended vaccines. In addition, they have a high VH prevalence focused on the same vaccines as among the general population. These are important findings given that nurses are in regular contact with patients vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases and their VH could negatively influence patients' vaccination acceptance.

"BACKGROUND: Only one strain (the Czech CAPM-v351) of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) has been released in Australia and New Zealand to control pest populations of the European rabbit O. cuniculus. Antigenic variants of RHDV known as RHDVa strains are reportedly replacing RHDV strains in other parts of the world, and Australia is currently investigating the usefulness of RHDVa to complement rabbit biocontrol efforts in Australia and New Zealand. RHDV efficiently kills adult rabbits but not rabbit kittens, which are more resistant to RHD the younger they are and which may carry the virus without signs of disease for prolonged periods. These different infection patterns in young rabbits may significantly influence RHDV epidemiology in the field and hence attempts to control rabbit numbers. METHODS: We quantified RHDV replication and shedding in 4-5 week old rabbits using quantitative real time PCR to assess their potential to shape RHDV epidemiology by shedding and transmitting virus. We further compared RHDV-v351 with an antigenic variant strain of RHDVa in kittens that is currently being considered as a potential RHDV strain for future release to improve rabbit biocontrol in Australia. RESULTS: Kittens were susceptible to infection with virus doses as low as 10 ID50. Virus growth, shedding and transmission after RHDVa infection was found to be comparable or non-significantly lower compared to RHDV. Virus replication and shedding was observed in all kittens infected, but was low in comparison to adult rabbits. Both viruses were shed and transmitted to bystander rabbits. While blood titres indicated that 4-5 week old kittens mostly clear the infection even in the absence of maternal antibodies, virus titres in liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph node were still high on day 5 post infection. CONCLUSIONS: Rabbit kittens are susceptible to infection with very low doses of RHDV, and can transmit virus before they seroconvert. They may therefore play an important role in RHDV field epidemiology, in particular for virus transmission within social groups during virus outbreaks.

"European common voles (Microtus arvalis), captured in Belgium in 1999, were proven by molecular as well as by serological techniques to be infected with Tula hantavirus (TULV). This is the first evidence for the presence of TULV in this country. No indication of spill-over infections of Puumala virus, known to be highly endemic among bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) within the same geographical regions as the trapped TULV-infected common voles, was observed. Together with previous reports on the circulation of TULV in eastern/central Europe, this finding suggests a more wide-spread circulation of this hantavirus serotype throughout the continent.

"Sindbis virus (SINV) is an enveloped, mosquito-borne alphavirus. Here we generated and characterized a fluorescent protein-tagged (FP-tagged) SINV and found that the presence of the FP-tag (mCherry) affected glycoprotein transport to the plasma membrane whereas the specific infectivity of the virus was not affected. We examined the virions by transmission electron cryo-microscopy and determined the arrangement of the FP-tag on the surface of the virion. The fluorescent proteins are arranged icosahedrally on the virus surface in a stable manner that did not adversely affect receptor binding or fusion functions of E2 and E1, respectively. The delay in surface expression of the viral glycoproteins, as demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis, contributed to a 10-fold reduction in mCherry-E2 virus titer. There is a 1:1 ratio of mCherry to E2 incorporated into the virion, which leads to a strong fluorescence signal and thus facilitates single-particle tracking experiments. We used the FP-tagged virus for high-resolution live-cell imaging to study the spatial and temporal aspects of alphavirus assembly and budding from mammalian cells. These processes were further analyzed by thin section microscopy. The results demonstrate that SINV buds from the plasma membrane of infected cells and is dispersed into the surrounding media or spread to neighboring cells facilitated by its close association with filopodial extensions.

"The eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) is a hibernating species extensively used as an in vivo efficacy model for chronic human hepatitis B virus infection. Under laboratory conditions, woodchucks develop a pseudohibernation condition; thus, the pharmacokinetics (PK) of small-molecule therapeutics may be affected by the seasonal change. The seasonal PK of four probe compounds were characterized over 12 months in seven male and nine female laboratory-maintained woodchucks. These compounds were selected to study changes in oxidative metabolism [antipyrine (AP)], glucuronidation [raltegravir (RTG)], renal clearance [lamivudine (3TC)], and hepatic function [indocyanine green (ICG)]. Seasonal changes in physiologic parameters and PK were determined. Seasonal body weight increases were ≥30%. Seasonal changes in body temperature and heart rate were <10%. The mean AP exposure remained unchanged from April to August 2017, followed by a significant increase (≥1.0-fold) from August to December and subsequent decrease to baseline at the end of study. A similar trend was observed in RTG and 3TC exposures. The ICG exposure remained unchanged. No significant sex difference in PK was observed, although female woodchucks appeared to be less susceptible to seasonal PK and body weight changes. Significant seasonal PK changes for AP, RTG, and 3TC indicate decreases in oxidative metabolism, phase II glucuronidation, and renal clearance during pseudohibernation. The lack of seasonal change in ICG exposure suggests there are no significant changes in hepatic function. This information can be used to optimize the scheduling of woodchuck studies to avoid seasonally driven variation in drug PK. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Woodchuck is a hibernating species and is commonly used as a nonclinical model of hepatitis B infection. Investigation of seasonal PK changes is perhaps of greater interest to pharmaceutical industry scientists, who use the woodchuck model to optimize the scheduling of woodchuck studies to avoid seasonally driven variation in drug PK and/or toxicity. This information is also valuable to drug metabolism and veterinary scientists in understanding woodchuck's seasonal metabolism and behavior under the pseudohibernation condition.

"Reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency, thereby creating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, promises to transform regenerative medicine. Most instances of direct reprogramming have been achieved by forced expression of defined factors using multiple viral vectors. However, such iPS cells contain a large number of viral vector integrations, any one of which could cause unpredictable genetic dysfunction. Whereas c-Myc is dispensable for reprogramming, complete elimination of the other exogenous factors is also desired because ectopic expression of either Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) or Klf4 can induce dysplasia. Two transient transfection-reprogramming methods have been published to address this issue. However, the efficiency of both approaches is extremely low, and neither has been applied successfully to human cells so far. Here we show that non-viral transfection of a single multiprotein expression vector, which comprises the coding sequences of c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4 and Sox2 linked with 2A peptides, can reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts. Moreover, the transgene can be removed once reprogramming has been achieved. iPS cells produced with this non-viral vector show robust expression of pluripotency markers, indicating a reprogrammed state confirmed functionally by in vitro differentiation assays and formation of adult chimaeric mice. When the single-vector reprogramming system was combined with a piggyBac transposon, we succeeded in establishing reprogrammed human cell lines from embryonic fibroblasts with robust expression of pluripotency markers. This system minimizes genome modification in iPS cells and enables complete elimination of exogenous reprogramming factors, efficiently providing iPS cells that are applicable to regenerative medicine, drug screening and the establishment of disease models.

"Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal and has a poor prognosis. The most common alteration during the formation of pancreatic tumors is the activation of KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog) oncogene. As a new therapeutic strategy, the C19 molecule ((2S)-N-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-2-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-methylamine]propanamide) blocks the KRAS-membrane association in cancer cells. In addition, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer. In this research, a new dendrimer-based nanoradiopharmaceutical ((177)Lu-DN(C19)-CXCR4L) encapsulating C19 and functionalized to target CXCR4 receptors is proposed as both, a targeted radiotherapy system (lutetium-177) and an oncotherapeutic approach by the stabilization of KRAS4b-PDESδ complex to produce dual-specific therapy in pancreatic cancer. (177)The Lu-DN(C19)-CXCR4L was synthesized and characterized, C19 was encapsulated with 81% efficiency, the final nanosystem rendered a particle size of 67 nm and the specific uptake in pancreatic cell lines was demonstrated. The major cytotoxic effect was observed in the KRAS-dependent and radioresistant cell line Mia PaCa-2, which expresses a high density of CXCR4 receptors. The radiation dose of 3 Gy/Bq decreased viability to 7%, and this effect was attributed to the presence of C19. A synergistic effect (radio and chemotherapy) capable of reducing viability in pancreatic cancer cells through apoptotic mechanisms was demonstrated. Thus, (177)Lu-DN(C19)-CXCR4L nanoradiopharmaceutical is efficacious in pancreatic cancer cell lines overexpressing the CXCR4 receptor.

"Four azo dyes (Benzopurpurine 4B, trypan blue, Direct Blue 15, and Congo red) and their derivatives (o-tolidine, o-dianisidine, and benzidine) were studied for their effect on induction of interferon by influenza virus in mammalian, Rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2), cell monolayers. Whereas Benzopurpurine 4B, Direct Blue 15, and Congo red inhibited viral interferon induction from approximately 35 to 60%, negligible inhibition was noted with trypan blue and other derivative compounds. By comparison, when rat S9 fraction was used for enzymatic activation of azo dyes and derivatives, interferon inhibition was significantly depressed moreover (P less than 0.01 to less than 0.0001) by all chemical compounds. The concentration of rat S9 (0.5%) used for metabolic activation of dyes and congeners was critical because concentrations greater than 0.5% of S9 per se inhibited the interferon induction process. Uninduced hamster S9 and both Aroclor 1254-induced hamster and rat S9 fractions were all comparable in their ability to activate the chemical compounds tested. That potential mutagenic and carcinogenic chemicals which require metabolic activation can be discriminated on the basis of interferon induction inhibition in eukaryotic cell cultures augurs for the usefulness and credibility of this system.

"We developed an adenovirus vector for transduction of the human CD21 gene (Adv-CD21), the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific receptor on human B lymphocytes, to overcome the initial barrier of EBV infection in nonprimate mammalian cells. Inoculation of Adv-CD21 followed by exposure to recombinant EBV carrying a selectable marker resulted in the successful entry of EBV into three of seven nonprimate mammalian cell lines as evidenced by expression of EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA). The EBV-susceptible cell lines included rat glioma-derived 9L, rat mammary carcinoma-derived c-SST-2, and canine kidney-derived MDCK. Subsequent selection culture with G418 yielded drug-resistant cell clones. In these cell clones, EBV existed as an episomal form, as evidenced through the Gardella gel technique. Among the known EBV latency-associated gene products, EBV-encoded small RNAs, EBNA1 and transcripts from the BamHI-A rightward reading frame (BARF0), and latent membrane protein 2A were expressed in all EBV-infected cell clones. The viral lytic events could be induced in these cell clones by simultaneous treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and n-butyric acid, but they were abortive, and infectious virus was not produced. These results indicate that once the initial barrier for attachment is overcome artificially, EBV can establish a stable infection in some nonprimate mammalian cells, and they raise the possibility that transgenic animals with the human CD21 gene could provide an animal model for EBV infection.

"All of the ten strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus assayed on BHK 21/13S cells showed various degrees of plaque size heterogeneity. The amount of virus released from these plaques was usually very small because of rapid photodynamic inactivation by neutral red. When virus from large and small plaques of a specific strain was plated, the same distribution of plaque size was obtained from each clone. Although it was shown that surface virus could possibly be randomly distributed at the time of addition of neutral red overlays, no virus could be isolated from nonplaque areas. Two different strains of virus (CA1371 and WE) with markedly different plaque size ranges were separated by plaque excision from plates infected with a mixture of both viruses.

"The oncogenic properties of hamster embryo cells transformed by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) and SV40 virus following photodynamic inactivation using neutral red were determined by subcutaneous inoculation into newborn Syrian hamsters. Cells transformed by all three viruses produced palpable tumors after different latent periods. Histopathological examination showed that HSV-2 tumors were fibrosarcomas and metastases were often seen in the lungs. HSV-2 primary tumors were reinoculated subcutaneously into weanling hamsters; they developed palpable tumors within 2 weeks. HSV-specific antigens were detected in the cytoplasm and/or on the surface of both the HSV-1 and HSV-2 tumor-cell cultures by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. The same method revealed SV40 tumor antigen in the nuclei of the SV40 tumor cells. Sera from HSV or SV40 tumor-bearing hamsters gave positive reactions when tested against HSV-infected hamster cells or SV40-infected monkey cells, respectively. These results demonstrate that herpes simplex virus and SV40, whose infectivity was lost following photodynamic inactivation, retained the virus genetic information necessary for transformation of normal cells to an oncogenic phenotype.

"1. A long-standing question in ecology is how natural populations respond to a changing environment. Emergent optimal foraging theory-based models for individual variation go beyond the population level and predict how its individuals would respond to disturbances that produce changes in resource availability. 2. Evaluating variations in resource use patterns at the intrapopulation level in wild populations under changing environmental conditions would allow to further advance in the research on foraging ecology and evolution by gaining a better idea of the underlying mechanisms explaining trophic diversity. 3. In this study, we use a large spatio-temporal scale data set (western continental Europe, 1968-2006) on the diet of Bonelli's Eagle Aquila fasciata breeding pairs to analyse the predator trophic responses at the intrapopulation level to a prey population crash. In particular, we borrow metrics from studies on network structure and intrapopulation variation to understand how an emerging infectious disease [the rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD)] that caused the density of the eagle's primary prey (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus) to dramatically drop across Europe impacted on resource use patterns of this endangered raptor. 4. Following the major RHD outbreak, substantial changes in Bonelli's Eagle's diet diversity and organisation patterns at the intrapopulation level took place. Dietary variation among breeding pairs was larger after than before the outbreak. Before RHD, there were no clusters of pairs with similar diets, but significant clustering emerged after RHD. Moreover, diets at the pair level presented a nested pattern before RHD, but not after. 5. Here, we reveal how intrapopulation patterns of resource use can quantitatively and qualitatively vary, given drastic changes in resource availability. 6. For the first time, we show that a pathogen of a prey species can indirectly impact the intrapopulation patterns of resource use of an endangered predator.

"On account of their unique anatomy, physiology, natural history, ecology, and behavior, rattlesnakes make ideal subjects for a variety of different scientific disciplines. The prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) in Colorado was selected for investigation of its relationship to colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) with regard to spatial ecology. A total of 31 snakes were anesthetized and had radiotransmitters surgically implanted. In addition, at the time of their capture, all snakes underwent the following: (1) they had bacterial culture taken from their mouths for potential isolation of pathogenic bacteria; (2) similarly, they had cloacal bacterial cultures taken to assess potentially harmful bacteria passed in the feces; and (3) they had blood samples drawn to investigate the presence of any zoonotic agents in the serum of the snakes. The results of the study and their implications are discussed here. Traditionally, a low incidence of bacterial wound infection has been reported following snakebite. Nevertheless, the oral cavity of snakes has long been known to house a wide variety of bacterial flora. In our study, 10 different bacterial species were isolated from the mouths of the rattlesnakes, 6 of which are capable of being zoonotic pathogens and inducing human disease. More studies are necessary to see why more rattlesnake bites do not become infected despite the presence of such pathogenic bacteria. The results of fecal bacteria isolated revealed 13 bacterial species, 12 of which can cause disease in humans. Of the snakes whose samples were cultured, 26% were positive for the presence of the pathogen Salmonella arizonae, one of the causative agents of reptile-related salmonellosis in humans. It has long been reported that captive reptiles have a much higher incidence than wild, free-ranging species. This study shows the incidence of Salmonella in a wild, free-ranging population of rattlesnakes. In addition, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was isolated. This bacterium is associated with wound and soft tissue infections that can lead to sepsis, endocarditis, meningitis, and peritonitis. In addition, this bacterium has been increasingly implicated as an opportunistic pathogen to humans during pregnancies, hospitalizations, malignancies and chemotherapy, chronic respiratory diseases, and presurgical endotracheal intubation. Furthermore, S. maltophilia has an intense resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics, the results of our study showed the bacterium was resistant to multiple antibiotics. Our results indicate that anyone working with snake feces, dead skin, or their carcasses must follow reasonable hygiene protocols. Rattlesnakes tested for West Nile antibodies had positive results but these were invalidated owing to possible cross-reactivity with other unknown viruses, interference with snake serum proteins, and the fact that the test was not calibrated for rattlesnake serum. Still, the interesting implication remains, should we be regularly testing these animals as sentinels against potentially zoonotic diseases. The results of this study clearly show the value of veterinarians in a multidisciplinary study of this sort and the particular skill set they can offer. Veterinarians must get involved in conservation studies if the biodiversity of the planet is to be preserved.

"The calicivirus agent for rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) escaped from an island quarantine station to the Australian mainland in October 1995. Within 2 wk it was detected at an established field study site where wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) were being monitored in the Flinders Ranges National Park (South Australia, Australia). During November 1995, RHD reduced the rabbit numbers on the site by 95%. Approximately 3% of the population survived challenge by RHD and developed antibodies. Most of the antibody-positive survivors were 3- to 7-wk-old when challenged. Many rabbits died underground, but counts of rabbit carcasses found on the surface indicated that approximately 1 million rabbits had died above ground in the National Park, and that > 30 million rabbits may have died in adjacent areas during the November epidemic.

"Two hundred and twenty one blood samples representing eight different rodent species and the common shrew (Sorex araneus), collected in Norway between 1993 and 1995, were examined for anti-orthopoxvirus antibodies by a competition enzyme linked imunnosorbent assay (ELISA) and, when possible, an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The serological results indicated that the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) and Norway lemming (Lemmus lemmus) may be reservoir species for orthopoxviruses in Norway, with antibody prevalences of 17 (12/69), 30 (24/81) and 56% (19/34), respectively. Orthopoxvirus infection in lemmings has not been reported previously. On some other small rodent species such as field voles (Microtus agrestis), common rats (Rattus norvegicus), and common shrews, seropositive individuals were detected. However, the total number of tested animals was low, and the role of these species in the epidemiology of orthopoxvirus infections remains unclear. Attempts to isolate orthopoxviruses from these small mammals failed, although orthopoxvirus specific DNA sequences were detected previously in the same animals by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The serological results were compared with and discussed in the context of the occurrence of orthopoxvirus-specific DNA sequences, and it is concluded that orthopoxviruses are widely distributed among wildlife in Norway.

"Embryos and neonatal offspring of wild-captured cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) were tested for the presence of Bartonella spp. Isolates of Bartonella spp. were obtained from 18 of 31 embryos and 7 of 19 neonates from bacteremic dams of the two species; no isolates were obtained from material from non-bacteremic dams. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the isolates from embryos and neonates matched the phylogenetic group of Bartonella spp. isolates obtained from the mother. No antibodies to homologous Bartonella spp. antigens were detected in maternal and neonatal blood or embryonic tissue. These findings suggest the possibility of vertical transmission of Bartonella spp. among natural rodent hosts.

"In order to improve the transduction efficiency of insect baculovirus in mammalian cells, we constructed two recombinant baculoviruses, AcRed-tat and AcRed. Both viruses expressed red fluorescence protein gene (dsRed) as a reporter in mammalian cell lines. AcRed-tat also contained the coding sequence of HIV-1 Tat transduction peptide fused with viral major capsid protein gene vp39 and enhanced green fluorescence gene (egfp) driven by virus polyhedrin promoter. It expressed the Tat fusion protein in infected insect cells, which was incorporated into the nucleocapsids of progeny virus. As a control, AcRed had the fusion gene of vp39 and egfp driven by polyhedrin promoter. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that although similar level of red fluorescence was produced in HEK23 cells transduced by the two recombinant viruses, significantly higher red fluorescence level was seen in CHO and Vero cells transduced by AcRed-tat than that by AcRed. These results suggested that Tat transduction peptide might improve the baculovirus-mediated gene expression in some mammalian cells. Our work provided a new approach to improve baculovirus as a gene delivery vector for mammalian cells.

"Myxoma virus (MYXV), a member of the Poxviridae family, is the agent responsible for myxomatosis, a fatal disease in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Like all poxviruses, MYXV is known for encoding multiple proteins that regulate cellular signaling pathways. Among them, four proteins share the same ANK/PRANC structure: M148R, M149R, MNF (Myxoma Nuclear factor) and M-T5, all of them described as virulence factors. This family of poxvirus proteins, recently identified, has drawn considerable attention for its potential role in modulating the host ubiquitin-proteasome system during viral infection. To date, many members of this novel protein family have been shown to interact with SCF components, in vitro. Here, we focus on MNF gene, which has been shown to express a nuclear protein presenting nine ANK repeats, one of which has been identified as a nuclear localization signal. In transfection, MNF has been shown to colocalise with the transcription factor NF-kappaB in the nucleus of TNFalpha-stimulated cells. Functionally, MNF is a critical virulence factor since its deletion generates an almost apathogenic virus. In this study, to pursue the investigation of proteins interacting with MNF and of its mechanism of action, we engineered a recombinant MYXV expressing a GFP-linked MNF under the control of MNF native promoter. Infection of rabbits with MYXV-GFPMNF recombinant virus provided the evidence that the GFP fusion does not disturb the main function of MNF. Hence, cells were infected with MYXV-GFPMNF and immunoprecipitation of the GFPMNF fusion protein was performed to identify MNF's partners. For the first time, endogenous components of SCF (Cullin-1 and Skp1) were co-precipitated with an ANK myxoma virus protein, expressed in an infectious context, and without over-expression of any protein.

"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) infection appears to be halted in rainbow trout nucleated red blood cells (RBCs). Diverse mechanisms are thought to be related to the antiviral immune response of rainbow trout RBCs to VHSV. However, the specific rainbow trout RBC proteins that interact directly with VHSV are still unknown. In an attempt to identify VHSV-RBC protein interactions, we characterized the immunoprecipitated (IP) proteome of RBCs exposed to VHSV using an antibody against the N protein of VHSV. The IP proteomic characterization identified 31 proteins by mass spectrometry analysis. Among them, we identified interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 5 (IFIT5), a protein belonging to a family of proteins that are induced after the production of type I interferon. Importantly, IFIT5 has been implicated in the antiviral immune response. We confirmed the participation of IFIT5 in the rainbow trout RBC antiviral response by examining the expression profile of IFIT5 in RBCs after VHSV exposure at transcriptional and protein levels. We detected a correlation between the highest IFIT5 expression levels and the decline in VHSV replication at 6 h post-exposure. In addition, silencing ifit5 resulted in a significant increase in VHSV replication in RBCs. Moreover, an increase in VHSV replication was observed in RBCs when the IFIT5 RNA-binding pocket cavity was modulated by using a natural compound from the SuperNatural II database. We performed a proximity ligation assay and detected a significant increase in positive cells among VHSV-exposed RBCs compared to unexposed RBCs, indicating protein-protein colocalization between IFIT5 and the glycoprotein G of VHSV. In summary, these results suggest a possible role of IFIT5 in the antiviral response of RBCs against VHSV.

"The core (capsid) protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the building block of nucleocapsids where viral DNA reverse transcriptional replication takes place and mediates virus-host cell interaction important for the persistence of HBV infection. The pleiotropic role of core protein (Cp) in HBV replication makes it an attractive target for antiviral therapies of chronic hepatitis B, a disease that affects more than 257 million people worldwide without a cure. Recent clinical studies indicate that core protein allosteric modulators (CpAMs) have a great promise as a key component of hepatitis B curative therapies. Particularly, it has been demonstrated that modulation of Cp dimer-dimer interactions by several chemical series of CpAMs not only inhibit nucleocapsid assembly and viral DNA replication, but also induce the disassembly of double-stranded DNA-containing nucleocapsids to prevent the synthesis of cccDNA. Moreover, the different chemotypes of CpAMs modulate Cp assembly by interaction with distinct amino acid residues at the HAP pocket between Cp dimer-dimer interfaces, which results in the assembly of Cp dimers into either non-capsid Cp polymers (type I CpAMs) or empty capsids with distinct physical property (type II CpAMs). The different CpAMs also differentially modulate Cp metabolism and subcellular distribution, which may impact cccDNA metabolism and host antiviral immune responses, the critical factors for the cure of chronic HBV infection. This review article highlights the recent research progress on the structure and function of core protein in HBV replication cycle, the mode of action of CpAMs, as well as the current status and perspectives on the discovery and development of core protein-targeting antivirals. This article forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on ""Wide-ranging immune and direct-acting antiviral approaches to curing HBV and HDV infections.""

"ILs, as essential innate immune modulators, are involved in an array of biological processes. In the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12A, IL-12B, IL-15 and IL-18 have been implicated in inflammatory processes and in the immune response against rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and myxoma virus infections. In this study we characterized these ILs in six Lagomorpha species (European rabbit, pygmy rabbit, two cottontail rabbit species, European brown hare and American pika). Overall, these ILs are conserved between lagomorphs, including in their exon/intron structure. Most differences were observed between leporids and American pika. Indeed, when comparing both, some relevant differences were observed in American pika, such as the location of the stop codon in IL-1α and IL-2, the existence of a different transcript in IL8 and the number of cysteine residues in IL-1β. Changes at N-glycosylation motifs were also detected in IL-1, IL-10, IL-12B and IL-15. IL-1α is the protein that presents the highest evolutionary distances, which is in contrast to IL-12A where the distances between lagomorphs are the lowest. For all these ILs, sequences of human and European rabbit are more closely related than between human and mouse or European rabbit and mouse.

"Traditional primary and secondary cell cultures have been used for the investigation of prion biology and disease for many years. While both types of cultures produce highly valid and immensely valuable results, they also have their limitations; traditional cell lines are often derived from cancers, therefore subject to numerous DNA changes, and primary cultures are labor-intensive and expensive to produce requiring sacrifice of many animals. Neural stem cell (NSC) cultures are a relatively new technology to be used for the study of prion biology and disease. While NSCs are subject to their own limitations-they are generally cultured ex vivo in environments that artificially force their growth-they also have their own unique advantages. NSCs retain the ability for self-renewal and can therefore be propagated in culture similarly to secondary cultures without genetic manipulation. In addition, NSCs are multipotent; they can be induced to differentiate into mature cells of central nervous system (CNS) linage. The combination of self-renewal and multipotency allows NSCs to be used as a primary cell line over multiple generations saving time, costs, and animal harvests, thus providing a valuable addition to the existing cell culture repertoire used for investigation of prion biology and disease. Furthermore, NSC cultures can be generated from mice of any genotype, either by embryonic harvest or harvest from adult brain, allowing gene expression to be studied without further genetic manipulation. This chapter describes a standard method of culturing adult NSCs and assays for monitoring NSC growth, migration, and differentiation and revisits basic reactive oxygen species detection in the context of NSC cultures.

"OBJECTIVE: Chronic central administration of neuropeptide Y (NPY) has dramatic effects on energy balance; however, the exact role of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in this is unknown. The aim of this study was to further unravel the contribution of NPY signaling in the PVN to energy balance. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Recombinant adeno-associated viral particles containing NPY (rAAV-NPY) were injected in the rat brain with coordinates targeted at the PVN. For three weeks, body weight, food intake, endocrine parameters, body temperature, and locomotor activity were measured. Furthermore, effects on insulin sensitivity and expression of NPY, agouti-related protein (AgRP), and pro-opiomelanocortin in the arcuate nucleus were studied. RESULTS: Food intake was increased specifically in the light period, and dark phase body temperature and locomotor activity were reduced. This resulted in obesity characterized by increased fat mass; elevated plasma insulin, leptin, and adiponectin; decreased AgRP expression in the arcuate nucleus; and decreased insulin sensitivity; whereas plasma corticosterone was unaffected. DISCUSSION: These data suggest that increased NPY expression targeted at the PVN is sufficient to induce obesity. Interestingly, plasma concentrations of leptin and insulin were elevated before a rise in food intake, which suggests that NPY in the PVN influences leptin and insulin secretion independently from food intake. This strengthens the role of the PVN in regulation of energy balance by NPY.

"AIMS: To review the literature on sharps injuries and occupational bloodborne virus transmission in health care in the UK and the worldwide evidence for injury prevention of sharps safety devices. METHODS: Literature review by online database and Internet resource search. RESULTS: Twenty-four relevant publications were identified regarding UK reported sharps injury rates. UK studies showed as much as a 10-fold difference between injuries reported through standard reporting systems (0.78-5.15 per 100 person-years) and rates estimated from retrospective questionnaires of clinical populations (30-284 per 100 person-years). National surveillance data from England, Wales and Northern Ireland gives a rate of 1.43 known hepatitis C virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmissions to health care workers per annum. When extrapolated, this suggests an approximate rate of 0.009 such viral transmissions per 1000 hospital beds per annum. Risk of infection from sources with no risk factors is extremely small (less than one in one million for HIV transmission based on Scottish data). Thirty-one studies on the efficacy of sharps safety devices showed evidence of a reduction in injuries, with the greatest reductions achieved by blunt suture needles and safety cannulae. CONCLUSIONS: Although injuries remain common, confirmed viral transmission in the UK has been relatively rare. The degree of under-reporting of sharps injuries may be as much as 10-fold. Safety-engineered devices are likely to be effective at injury reduction.

"The conserved influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) stem domain elicits cross-reactive antibodies, but epitopes in the globular head typically elicit strain-specific responses because of the hypervariability of this region. We isolated human monoclonal antibody 5J8, which neutralized a broad spectrum of 20th century H1N1 viruses and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus. Fine mapping of the interaction unexpectedly revealed a novel epitope between the receptor-binding pocket and the Ca₂ antigenic site on HA. This antibody exposes a new mechanism underlying broad immunity against H1N1 influenza viruses and identifies a conserved epitope that might be incorporated into engineered H1 virus vaccines.

"Tenofovir (9-(R)-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)-adenine) is an antiretroviral drug widely used for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. Tenofovir is extensively and rapidly excreted unchanged in the urine. In the expectation that tenofovir could potentially reach agricultural lands through the application of municipal biosolids or wastewater, and in the absence of any environmental fate data, we evaluated its persistence in selected agricultural soils. Less than 10% of [adenine-8-(14)C]-tenofovir added to soils varying widely in texture (sand, loam, clay loam) was mineralized in a 2-month incubation under laboratory conditions. Tenofovir was less readily extractable from clay soils than from a loam or a sandy loam soil. Radioactive residues of tenofovir were removed from the soil extractable fraction with DT(50)s ranging from 24±2 to 67+22days (first order kinetic model) or 44+9 to 127+55days (zero order model). No extractable transformation products were detectable by HPLC. Tenofovir mineralization in the loam soil increased with temperature (range 4°C to 30°C), and did not occur in autoclaved soil, suggesting a microbial basis. Mineralization rates increased with soil moisture content, ranging from air-dried to saturated. In summary, tenofovir was relatively persistent in soils, there were no extractable transformation products detected, and the response of [adenine-8-(14)C]-tenofovir mineralization to soil temperature and heat sterilization indicated that the molecule was biodegraded by aerobic microorganisms. Sorption isotherms with dewatered biosolids suggested that tenofovir residues could potentially partition into the particulate fraction during sewage treatment.

"Virus adsorption to soils is considered to be the most important factor in removing viruses after land treatment of wastewater. Most of the studies on virus adsorption to soils have utilized poliovirus as the model system. In the present study, comparative adsorption of a number of different types and strains of human enteroviruses and bacteriophages to nine different soil types was studied. Under the experimental conditions of this study, greater than 90% of all viruses adsorbed to a sandy loam soil except echovirus types 1, 12, and 29 and a simian rotavirus (SA-11), which adsorbed to a considerably lower degree. A great deal of variability was observed between adsorption of different strains of echovirus type 1, indicating that viral adsorption to soils is highly strain dependent. Of the five phages studied, f2 and phi X174 adsorbed the least. In addition to being dependent on type and strain of virus, adsorption was found to be influenced also by type of soil. Thus, soils having a saturated pH of less than 5 were generally good adsorbers. From these results, it appears that no one enterovirus or coliphage can be used as the sole model for determining the adsorptive behavior of viruses to soils and that no single soil can be used as the model for determining viral adsorptive capacity of all soil types.

"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data suggests that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cancer incidence and mortality. We investigate the effects of cyclical intermittent hypoxia (CIH), akin to the underlying pathophysiology of OSA, on lung cancer progression and metastatic profile in a mouse model. METHODS: Intrathoracic injection of Ad5CMVCre virus into a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) KrasG12D+/-; p53fl/fl; myristolated-p110αfl/fl-ROSA-gfp was utilized to induce a solitary lung cancer. Male mice were then exposed to either CIH or Sham for 40-41 days until harvest. To monitor malignant progression, serial micro CT scans with respiratory gating (no contrast) was performed. To detect spontaneous metastases in distant organs, H&E and immunohistochemistry were performed. RESULTS: Eighty-eight percent of injected Ad5CMVCre virus was recovered from left lung tissue, indicating reliable and accurate injections. Serial micro CT demonstrated that CIH increases primary lung tumor volume progression compared to Sham on days 33 (p = 0.004) and 40 (p<0.001) post-injection. In addition, CIH increases variability in tumor volume on day 19 (p<0.0001), day 26 (p<0.0001), day 33 (p = 0.025) and day 40 (p = 0.004). Finally, metastases are frequently detected in heart, mediastinal lymph nodes, and right lung using H&E and immunohistochemistry. CONCLUSIONS: Using a GEM mouse model of metastatic lung cancer, we report that male mice with solitary lung cancer have accelerated malignant progression and increased variability in tumor growth when exposed to cyclical intermittent hypoxia. Our results indicate that cyclical intermittent hypoxia is a pathogenic factor in non-small cell lung cancer that promotes the more rapid growth of developing tumors.

"Multimodality imaging using several reporter genes and imaging technologies has become an increasingly important tool in determining the location(s), magnitude, and time variation of reporter gene expression in small animals. We have reported construction and validation of several triple fusion genes composed of a bioluminescent, a fluorescent, and a positron emission tomography (PET) reporter gene in cell culture and in living subjects. However, the bioluminescent and fluorescent components of fusion reporter proteins encoded by these vectors possess lesser activities when compared with the bioluminescent and fluorescent components of the nonfusions. In this study, we first created a mutant (mtfl) of a thermostable firefly luciferase (tfl) bearing the peroxisome localization signal to have greater cytoplasmic localization and improved access for its substrate, d-luciferin. Comparison between the three luciferases [mtfl, tfl, and firefly luciferase (fl)] both in cell culture and in living mice revealed that mtfl possessed 6- to 10-fold (in vitro) and 2-fold (in vivo) higher activity than fl. The improved version of the triple fusion vector carrying mtfl as the bioluminescent reporter component showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher bioluminescence than the previous triple fusion vectors. Of the three different red fluorescent reporter genes (jred, hcred, and mrfp1, isolated from jellyfish chromophore, coral Heteractis crispa, and coral Discosoma, respectively) evaluated, mrfp1 was able to preserve highest expression as a component of the triple fusion reporter gene for in vivo fluorescence imaging. A truncated version of wild-type herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) thymidine kinase gene (wttk) retained a higher expression level than the truncated mutant HSV1-sr39 TK (ttk) as the third reporter component of this improved triple fusion vector. Multimodality imaging of tumor-bearing mice using bioluminescence and microPET showed higher luciferase activity [(2.7 +/- 0.1 versus 1.9 +/- 0.1) x (10(6) p/s/cm(2)/sr)] but similar level of fluorine-18-labeled 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil (18F-FEAU) uptake (1.37 +/- 0.15 versus 1.37 +/- 0.2) percentage injected dose per gram] by mtfl-mrfp1-wttk-expressing tumors compared with the fl-mrfp1-wttk-expressing tumors. Both tumors showed 4- to 5-fold higher accumulation (P < 0.05) of 18F-FEAU than fluorine-18-labeled 9-(4-fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)guanine. This improved triple fusion reporter vector will enable high sensitivity detection of lower numbers of cells from living animals using the combined bioluminescence, fluorescence, and microPET imaging techniques.

"The autophagy-related proteins ATG12 and ATG5 form a covalent complex essential for autophagy. Here, we demonstrate that ATG12 has distinct functions from ATG5 in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-expressing neurons. Upon high-fat diet (HFD) consumption, mice lacking Atg12 in POMC-positive neurons exhibit accelerated weight gain, adiposity, and glucose intolerance, which is associated with increased food intake, reduced ambulation, and decreased LEP/leptin sensitivity. Importantly, although genetic deletion of either Atg12 or Atg5 renders POMC neurons autophagy-deficient, mice lacking Atg5 in POMC neurons do not exhibit these phenotypes. Hence, we propose nonautophagic functions for ATG12 in POMC neurons that counteract excessive weight gain in response to HFD consumption.

"BACKGROUND: Bupleurum marginatum Wall. ex DC (Apiaceae) is a perennial herb widely used in traditional Chinese and Kampo medicine for the treatment of various infectious diseases. The biological activities of B. marginatum have not been fully investigated. This study aims to investigate the antitrypanosomal, antimicrobial and antiviral activities of methanol (ME) and dichloromethane (DCM) extracts of B. marginatum aerial parts and the ability of both extracts to inhibit the growth of different cancer cell lines. METHODS: Phytochemical characterization of the extracts was performed by LC-MS profiling. The antitrypanosomal activity was evaluated using the resazurin method. The antimicrobial activity was assessed using agar diffusion and microdilution methods, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined. The antiviral activity was determined for 6.25, 12.5, and 50 μg/mL doses using a plaque reduction assay. Cytotoxicity was investigated in eight cancer cell lines (Caco-2, CCL-81, CCRF-CEM, COS-7, HL-60, MIA PaCa-2, MCF-7, and PANC-1) using the MTT assay and the caspase 3/7 activity was determined over the range of 62.5-1000 μg/mL. RESULTS: Phytochemical analyses resulted in the characterization of 15 components, mainly flavonoids and lignans. The DCM extract showed significant antitrypanosomal activity (IC50: 36.21 μg/mL) and moderate activity against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC value: 0.25 mg/mL). At a dose of 12.5 μg/mL, the DCM extract inhibited 73.6% of the plaque production by hepatitis A virus. CCRF-CEM cells were the most sensitive to both extracts (IC50: 12.5-22.7 μg/mL). The cytotoxicity was mediated by induction of apoptosis (19-fold increase in the cellular caspase 3/7 level after treatment with the DCM extract at 1 mg/mL). CONCLUSIONS: ME and DCM extract of B. marginatum showed anti-infective and antiproliferative effects.

"Rous sarcoma virus RNA contains a negative regulator of splicing (NRS) element that aids in maintenance of unspliced RNA. The NRS binds U1 snRNA at a sequence that deviates from the 5' splice site consensus by substitution of U's for A's at three positions: -2, +3, and +4. All three of these U's are important for NRS-mediated splicing suppression. Substitution of a single nonconsensus C or G at any of these sites diminished NRS activity, whereas substitution of a single A generated a preferred 5' splice site within the NRS.

"Activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is crucial for immune responses. IKKε is an IκB kinase (IKK)-related kinase, and the function of IKKε remains obscure in T cells, despite its abundant expression. We report that IKKε inhibits NFAT activation and T cell responses by promoting NFATc1 phosphorylation. During T cell activation, IKKε was transiently activated to phosphorylate NFATc1. Loss of IKKε elevated T cell antitumor and antiviral immunity and, therefore, reduced tumor development and persistent viral infection. IKKε was activated in CD8(+) T cells of mice bearing melanoma or persistently infected with a model herpesvirus. These results collectively show that IKKε promotes NFATc1 phosphorylation and inhibits T cell responses, identifying IKKε as a crucial negative regulator of T cell activation and a potential target for immunotherapy.

"Wildlife-originated zoonotic diseases in general are a major contributor to emerging infectious diseases. Hantaviruses more specifically cause thousands of human disease cases annually worldwide, while understanding and predicting human hantavirus epidemics pose numerous unsolved challenges. Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a human infection caused by Puumala virus, which is naturally carried and shed by bank voles (Myodes glareolus). The objective of this study was to develop a method that allows model-based predicting 3 months ahead of the occurrence of NE epidemics. Two data sets were utilized to develop and test the models. These data sets were concerned with NE cases in Finland and Belgium. In this study, we selected the most relevant inputs from all the available data for use in a dynamic linear regression (DLR) model. The number of NE cases in Finland were modelled using data from 1996 to 2008. The NE cases were predicted based on the time series data of average monthly air temperature (°C) and bank voles' trapping index using a DLR model. The bank voles' trapping index data were interpolated using a related dynamic harmonic regression model (DHR). Here, the DLR and DHR models used time-varying parameters. Both the DHR and DLR models were based on a unified state-space estimation framework. For the Belgium case, no time series of the bank voles' population dynamics were available. Several studies, however, have suggested that the population of bank voles is related to the variation in seed production of beech and oak trees in Northern Europe. Therefore, the NE occurrence pattern in Belgium was predicted based on a DLR model by using remotely sensed phenology parameters of broad-leaved forests, together with the oak and beech seed categories and average monthly air temperature (°C) using data from 2001 to 2009. Our results suggest that even without any knowledge about hantavirus dynamics in the host population, the time variation in NE outbreaks in Finland could be predicted 3 months ahead with a 34% mean relative prediction error (MRPE). This took into account solely the population dynamics of the carrier species (bank voles). The time series analysis also revealed that climate change, as represented by the vegetation index, changes in forest phenology derived from satellite images and directly measured air temperature, may affect the mechanics of NE transmission. NE outbreaks in Belgium were predicted 3 months ahead with a 40% MRPE, based only on the climatological and vegetation data, in this case, without any knowledge of the bank vole's population dynamics. In this research, we demonstrated that NE outbreaks can be predicted using climate and vegetation data or the bank vole's population dynamics, by using dynamic data-based models with time-varying parameters. Such a predictive modelling approach might be used as a step towards the development of new tools for the prevention of future NE outbreaks.

"To develop a rat model that allowed in vivo progressive human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, allogeneic liver transplantation was performed across a rat combination of Dark Agouti (DA) to Brown Norway (BN). AD169, a well-characterized laboratory strain of HCMV, was used to establish a rat model of HCMV infection by injection of 0.4 mL (30.0 logTCID50) supernate into the rat peritoneum. Histological and blood specimens were obtained from animals sacrificed at predetermined timepoints. We performed immunohistochemical staining in liver, heart, kidney, spleen, and lung for HCMV immediate-early antigen (IE), lower matrix protein (pp65) detection in peripheral blood leukocytes, and HCMV early antigen (EA) and late antigen (LA). We compared survival rates. Our results showed positive HCMV IE and pp65 antigenemia detected in peripheral blood leukocytes in transplanted recipients from day 1 to day 30. Positive HCMV EA and LA staining cells were only detected in sections 10 days after liver transplantation, namely, in hepatocytes, mononuclear cells, bile duct epithelial cells, and endothelial cells. Successful HCMV replication was due to the combination of liver transplantation and cyclosporine (CsA) immunosuppression. Survival analysis showed no significant differences between the HCMV-infected group and HCMV-uninfected group. This new rat model of HCMV infection may be helpful to understand immune system modulation of HCMV infection.

"Tyrosine kinase are important mediators of signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. In order to better understand the mechanism of catalysis we studied a set of mutants of the prototype tyrosine kinase, the c-Src protein, a homologue of the Rous Sarcoma virus oncogene. Based on an X-ray structure of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) we mutated an arginine residue conserved in subdomain VI of all known kinases to a non-charged residue. This residue coordinates phosphate of the autophosphorylation site located in subdomain VII of cAPK and this interaction has been proposed to be crucial for substrate binding. The mutant R385A of c-Src had low kinase activity towards exogenous substrates yet was able to autophosphorylate at tyrosine 416. When introduced into an activated v-src gene the R385A mutation totally blocked cell transformation. Our data suggest that the function of the conserved arginine 385 is to coordinate the phosphate of the autophosphorylation site and to provide in this way a stable template for substrate binding.

"Parvovirus enteritis developed in 10 of 17 vaccinated juvenile bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) from 4 litters in a 5-month period. Nine dogs died. The first outbreak involved 6 of 9 bush dogs from 2 litters. Each had been vaccinated with a killed feline-origin parvovirus vaccine at 11 and 14 weeks of age. The 6 affected dogs became ill at 29 weeks of age and died. The second outbreak involved a litter of 6 bush dogs. Each had been vaccinated every 2 weeks starting at 5 weeks of age. Two were isolated from the colony at 16 weeks of age for treatment of foot sores. Three of the 4 nonisolated dogs developed parvovirus enteritis at 20 weeks of age; 2 died at 6 and 8 days, respectively, after onset of signs. The 3rd outbreak involved a litter of 2 bush dogs. Both had been vaccinated every 2 to 3 weeks, starting at 6 weeks of age. One of these dogs became ill at 17 weeks and died 13 days later. A litter of 6 maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) and a litter of 3 bush dogs were isolated from their parent colonies at 13 and 15 weeks of age, respectively. Each animal had been vaccinated weekly, beginning at 8 weeks of age, using an inactivated canine-origin parvovirus vaccine. None of the isolated animals developed the disease. Serologic testing during isolation did not reveal protective titers (greater than or equal to 1:80) against canine parvovirus in the bush dogs until they were 23 weeks old, whereas protective titers developed in the maned wolves when they were 14 to 18 weeks old. One hand-raised bush dog was vaccinated weekly, beginning at 8 weeks of age, and a protective titer developed by 21 weeks of age. It was concluded that the juvenile bush dogs went through a period during which maternal antibodies interfered with immunization, yet did not protect against the disease. When the pups were isolated from the colony during this period, then vaccinated repeatedly until protective titers developed, the disease was prevented.

"Optogenetic techniques have given researchers unprecedented access to the function of discrete neural circuit elements and have been instrumental in the identification of novel brain pathways that become dysregulated in neuropsychiatric diseases. For example, stress is integrally linked to the manifestation and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric illness, including anxiety, addiction and depression. Due to the heterogeneous populations of genetically and neurochemically distinct neurons in areas such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), as well as their substantial number of projections, our understanding of how neural circuits become disturbed after stress has been limited. Using optogenetic tools, we are now able to selectively isolate distinct neural circuits that contribute to these disorders and perturb these circuits in vivo, which in turn may lead to the normalization of maladaptive behavior. This review will focus on current optogenetic strategies to identify, manipulate, and record from discrete neural circuit elements in vivo as well as highlight recent optogenetic studies that have been utilized to parcel out BNST function.

"Incorporation of reporter genes within virus genomes is an indispensable tool for interrogation of virus biology and pathogenesis. In previous work, we incorporated a fluorophore into a viral ORF by attaching it to the viral gene via a P2A ribosomal skipping sequence. This recombinant Nipah virus, however, was attenuated in vitro relative to WT virus. In this work, we determined that inefficient ribosomal skipping was a major contributing factor to this attenuation. Inserting a GSG linker before the P2A sequence resulted in essentially complete skipping, significantly improved growth in vitro, and WT lethality in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first time a recombinant virus of Mononegavirales with integration of a reporter into a viral ORF has been compared with the WT virus in vivo. Incorporating the GSG linker for improved skipping efficiency whenever functionally important is a critical consideration for recombinant virus design.

"Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is caused by a slow infectious pathogen, or prion. We found that purified fractions from the brains of two patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease contained protease-resistant proteins ranging in apparent molecular weight from 10,000 to 50,000. These proteins reacted with antibodies raised against the scrapie prion protein PrP 27-30. Rod-shaped particles were found in the brain tissue of the patients that were similar to those isolated from rodents with either scrapie or experimental Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. After being stained with Congo red dye, the protein polymers from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease exhibited green birefringence when examined under polarized light. Our findings suggest that the amyloid plaques found in the brains of patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may be composed of paracrystalline arrays of prions similar to those in prion diseases in laboratory animals.

"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is composed of a ribonucleoprotein core surrounded by a lipid envelope presenting an integral glycoprotein (G). The homotrimeric VSV G protein exhibits a membrane fusion activity that can be elicited by low pH. The fusion event is crucial to entry into the cell and disassembly followed by viral replication. To understand the conformational changes involved in this process, the effects of high hydrostatic pressure and urea on VSV particles and isolated G protein were investigated. With pressures up to 3.0 kbar VSV particles were converted into the fusogenic conformation, as measured by a fusion assay and by the binding of bis-ANS. The magnitude of the changes was similar to that promoted by lowering the pH. To further understand the relationship between stability and conversion into the fusion-active states, the stability of the G protein was tested against urea and high pressure. High urea produced a large red shift in the tryptophan fluorescence of G protein whereas pressure promoted a smaller change. Pressure induced equal fluorescence changes in isolated G protein and virions, indicating that virus inactivation induced by pressure is due to changes in the G protein. Fluorescence microscopy showed that pressurized particles were capable of fusing with the cell membrane without causing infection. We propose that pressure elicits a conformational change in the G protein, which maintains the fusion properties but suppresses the entry of the virus by endocytosis. Binding of bis-ANS indicates the presence of hydrophobic cavities in the G protein. Pressure also caused an increase in light scattering of VSV G protein, reinforcing the hypothesis that high pressure elicits the fusogenic activity of VSV G protein. This ""fusion-intermediate state"" induced by pressure has minor changes in secondary structure and is likely the cause of nonproductive infections.

"Myxoma virus is a member of Leporipoxviridae whose tropism is tightly restricted to lagomorphs. In susceptible Oryctolagus rabbits, the virus causes a highly lethal disease known as myxomatosis, which begins as a localized infection but rapidly disseminates throughout the animal, leading to immune compromise, mucosal infections, multiorgan failure, and death. In a research setting, myxoma infection of susceptible Oryctolagus cuniculus rabbits is used as a model of poxviral disease progression and represents one of only a few means to study the pathogenesis of this viral family in a native host species. However, the rapid progression of myxomatosis makes accurate prediction of humane endpoints critical to limiting animal pain and distress and preventing death as an endpoint. Here we present case studies of myxomatosis at 2 institutions and offer a refined scoring system to reliably track the course of disease in susceptible rabbits infected with myxoma virus.

"SETTING: A resource-limited urban setting in Zimbabwe with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility and yield of diabetes mellitus (DM) screening among TB patients in primary health care facilities. DESIGN: A descriptive study. RESULTS: Of the 1617 TB patients registered at 10 pilot facilities, close to two thirds (60%) were male and 798 (49%) were bacteriologically confirmed. The median age was 37 years; two thirds (67%) were co-infected with HIV. A total of 1305 (89%) were screened for DM, and 111 (8.5%, 95% CI 7.0-10.2) were newly diagnosed with DM. Low TB notifying sites were more likely than high TB notifying sites to screen patients using random blood glucose (RBG) (83% vs. 79%; P < 0.04). Screening increased gradually per quarter over the study period. There were, however, notable losses along the screening cascade, the reasons for which will need to be explored in future studies. CONCLUSION: The study findings indicate the feasibility of DM screening among TB patients, with considerable yield of persons newly diagnosed with DM. Scaling up of this intervention will need to address the observed losses along the screening cascade.

"BACKGROUND: Despite much research in chemotherapy and radiotherapy, pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains a fatal disease, highly resistant to all treatment modalities. Recent developments in the field of herpes simplex virus (HSV) engineering have allowed the generation of a number of promising virus vectors for treatment of many cancers, including pancreatic tumours. This study examined the use of one such virus, NV1023, in combination with radiation therapy in pancreatic cancer cell lines. METHODS: HSV therapy in combination with radiotherapy was investigated in pancreatic cancer cell lines Hs766T, Panc-1 and MIA PaCa-2. Multiple therapy effect analysis was performed by computerized simulation. Mechanisms underlying synergy, such as virus replication and apoptosis, were investigated. RESULTS: The combination of NV1023 and radiation yielded a synergistic oncolytic effect in all tested pancreatic cancer cell lines, with the greatest effect achieved in MIA PaCa-2. This effect was not mediated by an increase in rapid viral replication, but by a substantial increase in apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The synergistic oncolytic actions of HSV and radiotherapy observed in pancreatic cancer cell lines encourage further testing of this multimodality treatment.

"OBJECTIVES: The conserved residues 318-483 in the PB2 subunit of influenza A polymerase is an independently folded cap-binding domain (PB2cap) that exhibits a distinct binding mode from other host cap-binding proteins, which suggests that PB2cap might be an ideal drug target. This study aimed to identify a new class of anti-influenza inhibitors that specifically disrupts the interaction between PB2cap and host cap structures. METHODS: An innovative fluorescence polarization assay was established for primary screening, followed by cap-binding inhibitory activity, antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity evaluations of the selected compounds. The best compound was characterized by multi-cycle virus growth assay, cross-protection test, synergism evaluation, mini-replicon assay, binding affinity analysis, docking simulation and mouse study. RESULTS: Several PB2 cap-binding inhibitors were discovered. The compound 7-(4-hydroxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-6H,7H,8H-chromeno[3',4':5,6]pyrano[3,2-c]chromene-6,8-dione, designated PB2-39, was identified as a potent inhibitor of replication of multiple subtypes of influenza A virus, including H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H7N7, H7N9 and H9N2 in vitro and H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9 in vivo. Combinational treatment with the influenza virus release inhibitor zanamivir and PB2-39 exerted a synergistic anti-influenza effect. Mechanistic experiments supported that PB2-39 suppressed viral polymerase activity. Docking and binding affinity analyses demonstrated that PB2-39 interacted with the PB2 cap-binding pocket, suggesting its role as a cap-binding competitor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new insights for the strategic development of novel cap-binding inhibitors of influenza A viruses.

"BACKGROUND. A 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) seems to be associated with a reduction of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. METHODS. To explore the link between PCV13 implementation and children' visits in emergency departments (EDs) for pneumonia, we analyzed mandatory Electronics Emergency Department Abstracts (EEDA), in 7 EDs, located in southern France, from 2009 to 2014. Diagnosis related to visits were coded using International Classification Diseases-10 codes. All codes available for EEDA were used to define bacterial pneumonia (BP), viral pneumonia (VP), and nonspecific pneumonia (NSP). For adjustment, we also used codes related to influenza and bronchiolitis. Comparisons between periods (pre-PCV13, transitional, early post-PCV13, and late post-PCV13) were made by logistic regression. On daily aggregated data, a general linear model was constructed with daily proportion of BP as dependent variable, period as fixed factor, and daily proportion of viral respiratory infections (flu plus bronchiolitis) as covariate. RESULTS. Among 718 758 visits, 7284 were coded as CAP. A significant decline in CAP was noted only for children between 2 and 5 years of age. In contrast, the proportion of BP was dramatically reduced: 2.49 vs 5.17/1000 visits (odds ratio, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.55), whereas the proportion of VP was similar and NSP increased. After adjustment on influenza plus bronchiolitis, the decrease of BP remained significant. CONCLUSIONS. Electronics Emergency Department Abstracts analysis confirms an important reduction in children ED visits for BP after PCV13 implementation. The EEDA also allow a real-time surveillance of pneumonia and an adjustment on confounding factors, such as viral respiratory infections.

"The objectives of our study were to determine (i) removal of bacteriophage MS2 and phiX174, as surrogates for human pathogenic viruses, in an anoxic aquifer and (ii) the safe length of the microbial protection zone in anoxic aquifers. 3.5 Log units of MS2 were removed by adsorption and inactivation during 63 days residence time, which was 1.4 log units lower than removal of phiX174. These removal rates were considerably lower than previously reported for MS2 and phiX174 in oxic aquifers and consequently longer protection zones around anoxic aquifers might be needed. Therefore, the observed log removal of MS2 was used in a risk assessment approach to determine the required safe length of the microbial protection zone. In case of a leaking sewer in the vicinity of a well in an anoxic aquifer, the risk assessment demonstrated that a microbial protection zone of 110 m may be needed to meet a risk of infection of 10(-4) persons per year. This length can be two to three times larger than the length of the protection zone currently used in a number of countries.

"Epitopes were resolved at the amino acid level for nine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the central conserved region of protein G of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV-G). Peptide binding studies showed which amino acids in the epitope contributed to antibody binding. The details of the epitopes were compared with the high-resolution structure of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the central conserved region of BRSV-G, and this indicated which face of the central conserved region is the antigenic structure. The major linear epitope of the central conserved region of BRSV-G is located at the tip of the loop, overlapping a relatively flat surface formed by a double disulfide-bonded cystine noose. At least one, but possibly two sulfur atoms of a disulfide bridge that line the conserved pocket at the center of the flat surface, is a major contributor to antibody binding. Some of the residue positions in the epitope have mutated during the evolution of RSV-G, which suggests that the virus escaped antibody recognition with these mutations. Mutations that occur at positions 177 and 180 may have only a local effect on the antigenic surface, without influencing the structure of the backbone, whereas mutations at positions 183 and 184 will probably have major structural consequences. The study explains the antigenic, structural, and functional importance of each residue in the cystine noose which provides information for peptide vaccine design. Additionally, analysis of the epitopes demonstrated that two point mutations at positions 180 and 205 define the preliminary classification of BRSV subgroups.

"The retinoblastoma protein (Rb) acts as a critical cell-cycle regulator and loss of Rb function is associated with a variety of human cancer types. Here we report that Rb binds to members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, including c-Jun, and stimulates c-Jun transcriptional activity from an AP-1 consensus sequence. The interaction involves the leucine zipper region of c-Jun and the B pocket of Rb as well as a C-terminal domain. We also present evidence that the complexes are found in terminally differentiating keratinocytes and cells entering the G1 phase of the cell cycle after release from serum starvation. The human papillomavirus type 16 E7 protein, which binds to both c-Jun and Rb, inhibits the ability of Rb to activate c-Jun. The results provide evidence of a role for Rb as a transcriptional activator in early G1 and as a potential modulator of c-Jun expression during keratinocyte differentiation.

"The removal of enteric and tracer viruses by the overland runoff mode of domestic wastewater treatment was evaluated. Raw and primary and secondary treated wastewaters were sprayed onto grass-covered, 36-m soil plots of fine, sandy loam overlying an impermeable clay subsoil. Tracer bacteriophage f2 was seeded into the applied wastewaters, which were subsequently sampled at several points along the length of the plots. Assay of effluent samples revealed modest tracer virus removals of 30 to 60%. Data from timed experiments indicated that advancement of tracer virus to the bottom of the slopes proceeded at the same rate as wastewater, reaching the plot effluents within 50 to 90 min after application. Indigenous enteric virus levels were reduced by approximately 68 to 85% during migration down the treatment slopes. Soil sampling revealed that, although some f2 virus was found associated with the wastewater-saturated topsoil, little penetration of virus into the soil profile occurred. Laboratory soil adsorption studies revealed that poliovirus I was adsorbed much more readily than f2 virus. Comparison of virus removal characteristics during overland runoff with chemical removal characteristics of wastewater did not reveal any obvious correlations that could be used to predict virus removal.

"Modification of the tumor microenvironment by inflammatory cells represents a newly recognized driving force in cancer with critical roles in tumor invasion, growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Increased thrombolytic cascade serine proteases, specifically urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor, correlate with inflammatory cell migration, pancreatic cancer growth, invasion and unfavorable outcomes. Inflammation in pancreatic cancer is linked with myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) activity and cancer progression. Myxomavirus is a complex DNA virus encoding highly potent immune modulators. Serp-1 and M-T7 are two such secreted anti-inflammatory myxomaviral proteins. Serp-1 inhibits uPA, plasmin and coagulation factor X while M-T7 inhibits C, CC, and CXC chemokines. We have explored the potential use of these viral proteins for treatment of a range of human cancer isolates engrafted in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Engrafted tumors were treated with either Serp-1, neuroserpin, a related mammalian serpin that inhibits thrombolytic proteases, or M-T7. Serp-1 and neuroserpin inhibited growth of the pancreatic cancer cell line Hs766t (P=0.03 and P=0.01, respectively) at 4 weeks after implantation. Serp-1 also inhibited growth of a second pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2 in mice (P=0.02). Growth of the human breast cancer line MDA231 was not inhibited by Serp-1. M-T7, in contrast, did not alter growth of any of the cancer cell lines tested after implant into SCID mice. Serpin inhibition of pancreatic tumor growth was associated with a significant decrease in splenocyte MDSC counts by flow cytometry (P=0.009), without detected change in other splenocyte subpopulations. Serp-1 and NSP treatment also significantly reduced macrophage infiltration in tumors (P=0.001). In summary two anti-inflammatory serpins reduced inflammatory macrophage invasion and pancreatic tumor cell growth, suggesting potential therapeutic efficacy.

"DNA can be condensed with an excess of poly-cations in aqueous solutions forming stable particles of submicron size with positive surface charge. This charge surplus can be used to deposit alternating layers of polyanions and polycations on the surface surrounding the core of condensed DNA. Using poly-L-lysine (PLL) and succinylated PLL (SPLL) as polycation and polyanion, respectively, we demonstrated layer-by-layer architecture of the particles. Polyanions with a shorter carboxyl/backbone distance tend to disassemble binary DNA/PLL complexes by displacing DNA while polyanions with a longer carboxyl/backbone distance effectively formed a tertiary complex. The zeta potential of such complexes became negative, indicating effective surface recharging. The charge stoichiometry of the DNA/PLL/SPLL complex was found to be close to 1:1:1, resembling poly-electrolyte complexes layered on macrosurfaces. Recharged particles containing condensed plasmid DNA may find applications as non-viral gene delivery vectors.

"The cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) plays a critical role in host defense by sensing cytosolic DNA derived from microbial pathogens or mis-located cellular DNA. Upon DNA binding, cGAS utilizes GTP and ATP as substrates to synthesize cGAMP, leading to MITA-mediated innate immune response. In this study, we identified the phosphatase PPP6C as a negative regulator of cGAS-mediated innate immune response. PPP6C is constitutively associated with cGAS in un-stimulated cells. DNA virus infection causes rapid disassociation of PPP6C from cGAS, resulting in phosphorylation of human cGAS S435 or mouse cGAS S420 in its catalytic pocket. Mutation of this serine residue of cGAS impairs its ability to synthesize cGAMP upon DNA virus infection. In vitro experiments indicate that S420-phosphorylated mcGAS has higher affinity to GTP and enzymatic activity. PPP6C-deficiency promotes innate immune response to DNA virus in various cells. Our findings suggest that PPP6C-mediated dephosphorylation of a catalytic pocket serine residue of cGAS impairs its substrate binding activity and innate immune response, which provides a mechanism for keeping the DNA sensor cGAS inactive in the absence of infection to avoid autoimmune response.

"The CTL response to SV40 in C3H/HeJ mice is directed against the tumor (T) Ag and is H-2Kk restricted. CTL specific for both the amino terminus (residues 1-271) and the carboxyl terminus (residues 512-708) of the T Ag molecule have been detected, and we have previously cloned CTL of both specificities. In this paper we show that the panel of 10 CTL clones specific for the C-terminal region includes clones specific for three different epitopes, termed C1, C2, and C3. Epitopes C1 and C2 are conserved in the T Ag of the related papova viruses BK and SA12, and only epitopes C2 and C3 are present on SV40 transformed targets bearing the Kk mutant Kkml. Epitopes C1 and C2 were mapped to residues 563-576 by using in-frame deletion mutants of SV40 T antigen, and all clones specific for these two epitopes can lyse Kk bearing target cells in the presence of a synthetic peptide comprising residues 559-576. Kk and Kkml differ at residue 152, which is located in the Ag-binding pocket. Because epitopes C1 and C2 can be formed by the same antigenic peptide, but epitope C1 is not present on SV40 transformed Kkml cells, epitopes C1 and C2 must differ in the contribution made by residue 152 of the MHC class I molecule. These data show that CTL epitopes on transformed cells can be made up of Ag fragments, and strengthen the idea that this is a general phenomenon for both class I and class II restricted T cell epitopes.

"Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), isolated from a bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) in Slovakia in 1976 is a natural pathogen of wild murid rodents. This review is focused to biological properties of this pathogen, the mode of its maintenance in murid rodents as reservoir animals, mechanisms of its spread to other animals in the same biotope as well as to livestock and household animals. Potential role of ticks as vectors and the possibility of infection of humans with this virus are considered as well. All the above evidence of the virus infection of various hosts is based on serological or molecular analytical data. The presented knowledge indicates important epizootologic consequences, namely harboring and permanent maintenance of the virus in murid rodents as reservoir animals with a real possibility of spread to other animals in the same biotope. These relationships imply a cross-species virus transmission with potential serious consequences for the infected animals or humans.

"Ecological understanding of disease risk, emergence, and dynamics and of the efficacy of control strategies relies heavily on efficient tools for microorganism identification and characterization. Misdetection, such as the misclassification of infected hosts as healthy, can strongly bias estimates of disease prevalence and lead to inaccurate conclusions. In natural plant ecosystems, interest in assessing microbial dynamics is increasing exponentially, but guidelines for detection of microorganisms in wild plants remain limited, particularly so for plant viruses. To address this gap, we explored issues and solutions associated with virus detection by serological and molecular methods in noncrop plant species as applied to the globally important Barley yellow dwarf virus PAV (Luteoviridae), which infects wild native plants as well as crops. With enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), we demonstrate how virus detection in a perennial wild plant species may be much greater in stems than in leaves, although leaves are most commonly sampled, and may also vary among tillers within an individual, thereby highlighting the importance of designing effective sampling strategies. With reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we demonstrate how inhibitors in tissues of perennial wild hosts can suppress virus detection but can be overcome with methods and products that improve isolation and amplification of nucleic acids. These examples demonstrate the paramount importance of testing and validating survey designs and virus detection methods for noncrop plant communities to ensure accurate ecological surveys and reliable assumptions about virus dynamics in wild hosts.

"BACKGROUND: Diseases of the inner ear such as presbycusis, tinnitus, sudden hearing loss, and vertigo affect many patients, but so far there are no specific therapy options. Gene therapy might become a potential modality of treatment. Viral vectors are standard in animal models to date. Future considerations, however, call for a further evaluation of non-viral transfection methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The non-viral transfection agents Metafectene, Superfect, Effectene, and Mirus TransIT were incubated with a plasmid coding for GFP. In vivo, the plasmid-agent mix was injected via the membrane of the round window, and 48 h later the inner ear was perfused, harvested, decalcified, and histologically evaluated for GFP expression. RESULTS: Cationic lipids (Metafectene) and dendrimers (Superfect) were able to transfect cells in the area of the organ of Corti and lead to GFP expression. The polyamine (Mirus TransIT) did show expression of GFP in the area of Rosenthal's canal and in the area of the inner hair cell. The combination of a non-liposomal lipid with a DNA condensing component (Effectene) did not show transfection of the organ of Corti. In the area of the spiral ganglia cells, GFP expression was seen with all the transfection agents. CONCLUSIONS: Non-viral transfection agents are able to introduce a reporter gene in cells of the inner ear in vitro and in vivo. There are, however, differences in the efficiency of the transfection. They might be an alternative in gene therapy of the inner ear. Further investigations to elucidate their potential are needed.

"The p130 protein is a recently cloned member of the retinoblastoma protein family. We show here that transformation of NIH3T3-L1 fibroblasts (L1 cells) by the simian virus 40 large T antigen (LTAg) depends on the disruption of DNA binding complexes between transcription factor E2F and p130. LTAg binds to the pocket region of p130 in vivo and disrupts the E2F-p130 complexes. E2F-p130 complexes are present only in quiescent L1 cells and disappear at the G1/S phase boundary concomitantly to induction of DNA synthesis and expression of the E2F-regulated cdc2 gene. p130 is a substrate of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) in vitro and associates with a Cdk in vivo which is activated upon serum stimulation in late G1. Overexpression of p130 inhibits cdc2 promoter activity and entry of quiescent L1 cells into S phase. The results demonstrate that p130 is negative regulator of cell cycle progression which is specifically targeted by LTAg during cell transformation.

"Stimulation of the phenotypically immature B cell lymphoma WEHI-231 with anti-IgM induces G1 arrest followed by apoptotic cell death, which can be reversed by stimulation via the CD40 receptor. Here, we show that cells expressing bcl-xL (WEHI-bcl-xL) arrest at G0/G1 following culture with anti-IgM but do not undergo apoptosis. These arrested cells can be induced to reenter the cell cycle by ligation of CD40. We have therefore used these cells as a model to study the regulation of the transcription factor E2F, which is critically involved in transit through the cell cycle. We found that anti-IgM treatment induces the appearance of an inhibitory DNA binding complex containing the pRB-related pocket protein p130 together with E2F and a concomitant decrease in ""free"" E2F, consisting of E2F1 and its partner DP1; these effects were reversed following stimulation via CD40. These changes in free E2F levels were regulated by changes in E2F1 gene transcription, which is at least partly a result of control of E2F1 promoter activity through its E2F binding sites. Transient transfection experiments showed that either E2F1 or the viral oncoprotein E1A, which sequesters pocket proteins, including p130, overcame anti-IgM-induced cell cycle arrest in WEHI-bcl-xL. Taken together, these results indicate that in WEHI-231 sIgM ligation induces the accumulation of hypophosphorylated p130 with consequent inhibition of E2F1 gene transcription and cell cycle arrest. Conversely, ligation of CD40 causes hyperphosphorylation of p130, thereby releasing the repression of E2F1 and other E2F-regulated genes, enabling the cells to reenter the cycle. These results, therefore, provide novel insights into the mechanisms whereby antigen receptors on immature B cells deliver inhibitory signals (leading to negative selection of self-reactive B cells) and how these signals can be modulated by positive signals generated via CD40.

"Transformation of primary rodent cells by functions of the adenovirus type 12 (Ad12) early region 1 (E1) is reduced severalfold compared with transformation by E1 of Ad2. We analyzed whether the unique spacer region of Ad12 E1A that borders the conserved region (CR) 2 and represents an oncogenic determinant of Ad12 E1A is involved in this impaired transformation property, putatively by modulating transformation-relevant biological E1A functions. We show that a mutant (E1ASpm1) that lacks 12 amino-terminal residues of the spacer binds p105-Rb and p130 as Ad12 E1A wild type (E1Awt), whereas a second spacer mutant (E1ASpm2) that lacks an adjacent stretch of six alanines exhibits highly reduced binding to p105-Rb. The binding of this mutant to the p130 pocket protein is, however, little impaired. E1ASpm1 diminishes the formation of the p105-Rb-E2F complex more efficiently than E1Awt or, least efficient, E1ASpm2. These properties of the spacer mutants to target and to disintegrate the p105-Rb-E2F complex correspond with their ability to transform primary mouse cells in combination with E1B: E1ASpm1 (plus Ad12 E1B)-transfected cells could be easily established as cell lines, comparable to Ad12 E1Awt- or Ad2 E1Awt-transfected cells. In contrast, cells transfected with E1ASpm2 or Ad12 E1AdelCR2 (lacking the entire CR2) died within 6-10 weeks after replating, although foci were formed in all cases. Of note, the E1ASpm1-transformed cells grow as fast as the Ad2 E1Awt-transformed cells, with a doubling rate of 15 h, whereas the doubling of the Ad12 E1Awt-transformed cells takes approximately 120 h. Moreover, in the established cell lines, the affinity of E1ASpm1 to p105-Rb was higher than with that of E1Awt. Our data suggest the presence of a transformation-suppressing domain within the carboxyl-terminal 12 residues of the Ad12 E1A-unique spacer, whereas the hydrophobic stretch of six alanines in the spacer is required for stable transformation.

"A growth factor detected in the medium of vaccinia-virus-infected cells was purified to homogeneity. Sequence analysis shows it to be a processed form of a polypeptide encoded in the vaccinia virus genome which is related to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and alpha-transforming growth factor (alpha TGF). The amino terminus of the processed vaccinia virus growth factor (VVGF) begins at residue 20 of the primary translation product, indicating a signal sequence has been removed. The amino acid composition of purified VVGF predicts the carboxyl terminus is at, or near, residue 96, suggesting a transmembrane sequence has also been removed from secreted VVGF, which is, therefore, approximately 77 amino acids. VVGF, unlike EGF or alpha TGF, is glycosylated. VVGF binds to the EGF receptor and stimulates its autophosphorylation, suggesting that vaccinia virus has acquired sequences encoding a growth factor that may allow it to subvert EGF receptor-dependent functions.

"Rabbit neutrophil peptide-1 (NP-1), a prototypic alpha-defensin, protects cells in vitro from infection by clinical and laboratory isolates of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Incubation of concentrated virus stocks for 1 h with noncytotoxic concentrations of NP-1 reduces subsequent infection by >98%. Pretreating cells with NP-1 for 1 h prior to inoculation with untreated virus also prevents infection. NP-1, a cationic peptide, does not compete with viral envelope glycoproteins for binding to cellular heparan sulfate receptors, but it prevents viral entry. No VP16, a major viral tegument protein, is transported to the cell nucleus in the presence of NP-1. Infectious center assays demonstrate that NP-1 also inhibits cell-to-cell viral spread. Thus, NP-1 prevents virally mediated fusion events, entry, and cell-to-cell spread. This unique mechanism of anti-HSV activity, coupled with established antibacterial and possible anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 activities of defensins, render this family of compounds excellent candidates for further development as topical microbicides.

"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB) binds several cellular proteins involved in cell cycle progression. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we found that RB bound specifically to the protein BRG1. BRG1 shares extensive sequence similarity to Drosophila brahma, an activator of homeotic gene expression, and the yeast transcriptional activator SNF2/SW12. BRG1 contains an RB-binding motif found in viral oncoproteins and bound to the A/B pocket and the hypophosphorylated form of RB. BRG1 did not bind RB in viral oncoprotein-transformed cells. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments suggested BRG1 associates with the RB family in vivo. In the human carcinoma cell line SW13, BRG1 exhibited tumor suppressor activity by inducing formation of flat, growth-arrested cells. This activity depended on the ability of BRG1 to cooperate and complex with RB, as both an RB-nonbinding mutant of BRG1 and the sequestration of RB by adenovirus E1A protein abolished flat cell formation.

"The mouse biliary glycoprotein 1 gene (bgp1) encodes several multifunctional glycoprotein isoforms. These glycoproteins represent members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. The Bgp1 glycoproteins function as cell adhesion molecules and receptors for the mouse hepatitis viruses. In contrast to CEA, whose overexpression has been correlated with cancer progression, the human and mouse Bgp proteins are generally down-regulated upon tumor formation. In this study, we report on the mouse bgp1 gene organization and transcriptional activation. We have isolated phage and cosmid clones encompassing the entire bgp1 coding region. This gene consists of nine exons, some of which are subjected to alternative splicing producing a minimum of four splice variants. A comparison of the murine bgp1 proximal promoter with the human BGP and mouse cea10/bgp3 genes revealed sequence conservation of 66% and 95%, respectively. RNase protection assays and primer extension analyses indicated that the mouse bgp1 transcriptional start site is positioned 240 nucleotides upstream of the ATG translational initiation codon, which is 140 nucleotides further upstream than in any other CEA family member. The bgp1 promoter is transcriptionally active in reporter gene activation in vitro transfection studies and in vivo using a bgp1-containing cosmid clone. We identified three putative AP-2 or AP-2-like sites and an upstream stimulatory factor (USF) recognition sequence within the proximal mouse bgp1 promoter region at positions similar to those used by the human BGP promoter region. These data suggest that the regulation of the mouse and human BGP genes may follow some common spatial and temporal expression. Interestingly, the bgp1 proximal promoter and coding region are also well conserved throughout evolution.

"Hunger is a hard-wired motivational state essential for survival. Agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) at the base of the hypothalamus are crucial to the control of hunger. They are activated by caloric deficiency and, when naturally or artificially stimulated, they potently induce intense hunger and subsequent food intake. Consistent with their obligatory role in regulating appetite, genetic ablation or chemogenetic inhibition of AgRP neurons decreases feeding. Excitatory input to AgRP neurons is important in caloric-deficiency-induced activation, and is notable for its remarkable degree of caloric-state-dependent synaptic plasticity. Despite the important role of excitatory input, its source(s) has been unknown. Here, through the use of Cre-recombinase-enabled, cell-specific neuron mapping techniques in mice, we have discovered strong excitatory drive that, unexpectedly, emanates from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus, specifically from subsets of neurons expressing thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, also known as ADCYAP1). Chemogenetic stimulation of these afferent neurons in sated mice markedly activates AgRP neurons and induces intense feeding. Conversely, acute inhibition in mice with caloric-deficiency-induced hunger decreases feeding. Discovery of these afferent neurons capable of triggering hunger advances understanding of how this intense motivational state is regulated.

"Land treatment of animal or human waste can result in chemical and microbial contamination of shallow ground water and/or water-ways. We investigated the fate of a host-specific Salmonella bacteriophage and a nonreactive chemical (Br-) tracer when applied to large intact lysimeter soil cores (500 mm diam. by 700 mm high). The soils included a poorly drained Gley Soil and well-drained Pumice, Allophanic, and Recent Soils. A depth of 30 mm of water containing the bacteriophage and Br- was applied to the soil at a rate of 5 mm h(-1) followed by up to about 1.8 pore volumes of simulated rainfall. Resulting leachates, collected continuously over at least one pore volume were analyzed for the bacteriophage and bromide (Br-) tracers. Bromide moved uniformly through the Pumice and Allophanic Soils with peak concentrations at about 1 pore volume, while the bacteriophage was detected only at trace levels or not at all. In contrast, both Br- and bacteriophage tracers moved rapidly through Gley and Recent Soils, appearing early in the leachate and then tailing off. Such flow patterns in the Gley and Recent Soils are indicative of bypass flow. Coarse soil structure in the Gley Soil, and finger-flow due to water repellency in the sandy Recent Soil are considered responsible for the observed bypass flow in these two soils. Allophanic and Pumice Soils have finer, more porous soil structure leading to a predominance of matrix flow over bypass flow. This study suggests vertical movement of viruses varies significantly with soil type.

"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate and compare non-adherence to oral and inhaled antiviral therapies prescribed of a randomised clinical trial in outpatients with influenza A infection. DESIGN: A parallel, three-arm, double-blinded trial randomly allocated antiviral therapies twice daily for 5 days: (1) oral oseltamivir plus inhaled zanamivir (arm OZ); (2) oseltamivir plus inhaled placebo (arm Opz); or (3) oral placebo plus inhaled zanamivir (arm poZ). Analysis of non-adherence was a secondary objective of the trial. SETTINGS: Outpatients were enrolled by 145 general practitioners throughout France during the 2008-2009 seasonal influenza epidemics. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 541 adults presenting with influenza-like illness for less than 36 hours. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Non-persistence, the time between inclusion and the last dose treated as a failure time, was used as the primary endpoint. RESULTS: The proportions of patients who persisted on treatment until the end of prescription were estimated at 85.73% (±3.28%) for the oral route and 82.73% (±3.44%) for the inhaled route. Based on multivariable models, non-persistence was associated with a PCR confirmation of influenza for both the oral (HR=0.54, p=0.010) and inhaled (HR=0.59, p=0.018) drugs and antibiotic coprescriptions (HR=2.07, p=0.007; and HR=1.88, p=0.017, respectively) and active combination treatment (HR=1.71, p=0.035; and HR=1.58, p=0.035, respectively). The hazard of non-persistence of the inhaled therapy was increased compared with that of the oral therapy (HR=1.23, p=0.043). CONCLUSION: In addition to the clinical and virological profiles of influenza infection, non-persistence may have been influenced by an active combination and the route of administration. RCT REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00799760. This is a post-result analysis.

"Influenza virus A H7N9 remains a serious threat to public health due to the lack of effective vaccines and drugs. In this study, a neutralizing human antibody named 3L11 was rapidly isolated from the switched memory B cells of a patient infected with H7N9. The antibody 3L11 was encoded by the heavy-chain VH1-8 gene and the light-chain VL2-13 gene that had undergone somatic mutations, and conferred high affinity binding to H7N9 hemagglutinins (HAs). It promoted killing of infected cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Epitope mapping by mass spectroscopy (MS) indicated that 3L11 bound to the peptide 149-175 of HAs that contained the 150-loop of the receptor-binding site (RBS). Additionally, the 3L11 escape strains had G151R (Gly(151)→Arg(151)) and S152P (Ser(152)→Pro(152)) mutations within a conserved antigenic site A near the RBS that were not observed in field strains. Importantly, 3L11 fully protected mice against a lethal H7N9 virus challenge, in both pre- and postexposure administration regimens. Altogether, this work demonstrates the feasibility of rapid isolation of neutralizing H7N9 antibodies from infected patients and provides a potential prophylactic and therapeutic agent against H7N9 viruses.

"Congo red (CR) has been shown to inhibit the accumulation in scrapie-infected cells of prion protein (PrP) in the abnormal protease-resistant form (PrP-res). However, it was not clear if this effect was due to a direct interaction of CR with either PrP-res or its protease-sensitive precursor (PrP-sen) or to a less direct effect on living cells. Here we show that CR inhibits PrP-res formation in a simple cell-free reaction composed predominantly of purified PrP-res and PrP-sen. Structurally modified CR analogues were also compared in both the cell-free conversion reaction and scrapie-infected neuroblastoma cells. Methylation of the central phenyl groups at the 2,2' positions diminished the inhibitory potency by > or = 10-fold. In contrast, there was little effect of 3,3' methylation of the phenyls, deletion of one phenyl, or addition of an amido group between the phenyls. The relative activities of these compounds were well correlated in both cellular and acellular systems. Molecular modeling indicated that CR and 3,3'-methyl-CR have little rotational restriction about the biphenyl bond and can readily adopt a planar conformation, as can phenyl-CR and amido-CR. In contrast, 2,2'-methyl-CR is restricted to a nonplanar conformation of the biphenyl group. Thus, planarity and/or torsional mobility of the central phenyl rings of CR and its analogues is probably important for inhibition of PrP-res formation. On the other hand, variations in the intersulfonate distance in these molecules had little effect on PrP-res inhibition. These results indicated a high degree of structural specificity in the inhibition of PrP-res formation by CR and related compounds.

"This paper presents an evidence-based strategy for improving clinical outcomes in COVID-19. Recommendations are based on the phases of the disease, because optimal interventions for one phase may not be appropriate for a different phase. The four phases addressed are: Prevention, Infection, Inflammation and Recovery. Underlying this phased approach is recognition of emerging evidence for two different components of pathophysiology, early infection and late stage severe complications. These two aspects of the disease suggest two different patterns of clinical emphasis that seem on the surface to be not entirely concordant. We describe the application of therapeutic strategies and appropriate tactics that address four main stages of disease progression for COVID-19. Emerging evidence in COVID-19 suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may both evade the innate immune response and kill macrophages. Delayed innate immune response and a depleted population of macrophages can theoretically result in a blunted antigen presentation, delaying and diminishing activation of the adaptive immune response. Thus, one clinical strategy involves supporting patient innate and adaptive immune responses early in the time course of illness, with the goal of improving the timeliness, readiness, and robustness of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. At the other end of the disease pathology spectrum, risk of fatality in COVID-19 is driven by excessive and persistent upregulation of inflammatory mechanisms associated with cytokine storm. Thus, the second clinical strategy is to prevent or mitigate excessive inflammatory response to prevent the cytokine storm associated with high mortality risk. Clinical support for immune system pathogen clearance mechanisms involves obligate activation of immune response components that are inherently inflammatory. This puts the goals of the first clinical strategy (immune activation) potentially at odds with the goals of the second strategy(mitigation of proinflammatory effects). This creates a need for discernment about the time course of the illness and with that, understanding of which components of an overall strategy to apply at each phase of the time course of the illness. We review evidence from early observational studies and the existing literature on both outcomes and mechanisms of disease, to inform a phased approach to support the patient at risk for infection, with infection, with escalating inflammation during infection, and at risk of negative sequelae as they move into recovery.

"CD81 plays a central role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. Recent structural analysis of CD81 indicates that it contains an intramembrane cholesterol-binding pocket and that interaction with cholesterol may regulate a conformational switch in the large extracellular domain of CD81. Therefore, CD81 possesses a potential cholesterol-sensing mechanism; however, its relevance for protein function is thus far unknown. In this study we investigate CD81 cholesterol sensing in the context of its activity as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV). Structure-led mutagenesis of the cholesterol-binding pocket reduced CD81-cholesterol association but had disparate effects on HCV entry, both reducing and enhancing CD81 receptor activity. We reasoned that this could be explained by alterations in the consequences of cholesterol binding. To investigate this further we performed molecular dynamic simulations of CD81 with and without cholesterol; this identified a potential allosteric mechanism by which cholesterol binding regulates the conformation of CD81. To test this, we designed further mutations to force CD81 into either the open (cholesterol-unbound) or closed (cholesterol-bound) conformation. The open mutant of CD81 exhibited reduced HCV receptor activity, whereas the closed mutant enhanced activity. These data are consistent with cholesterol sensing switching CD81 between a receptor active and inactive state. CD81 interactome analysis also suggests that conformational switching may modulate the assembly of CD81-partner protein networks. This work furthers our understanding of the molecular mechanism of CD81 cholesterol sensing, how this relates to HCV entry, and CD81's function as a molecular scaffold; these insights are relevant to CD81's varied roles in both health and disease.

"In two blacktailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), hepatocellular carcinoma with metastasis to the lung, co-existing chronic active hepatitis, and hyperplasia of hepatocytes in the non-neoplastic areas of the liver tissue were observed. The hyperplastic hepatocytes had many eosinophilic inclusion bodies positive for orcein stain in their cytoplasm. Electron microscopy revealed areas of a specific mail-like mesh structure in the location of the cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Ultrastructure of inclusion bodies differed from that of the hepadna virus usually associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepadna virus-like particles were not observed.

"As new pathogenic viruses continue to emerge, it is paramount to have intervention strategies that target a common denominator in these pathogens. The fusion of viral and cellular membranes during viral entry is one such process that is used by many pathogenic viruses, including chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, and influenza virus. Obatoclax, a small-molecule antagonist of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, was previously determined to have activity against influenza A virus and also Sindbis virus. Here, we report it to be active against alphaviruses, like chikungunya virus (50% effective concentration [EC(50)] = 0.03 μM) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV; EC(50) = 0.11 μM). Obatoclax inhibited viral entry processes in an SFV temperature-sensitive mutant entry assay. A neutral red retention assay revealed that obatoclax induces the rapid neutralization of the acidic environment of endolysosomal vesicles and thereby most likely inhibits viral fusion. Characterization of escape mutants revealed that the L369I mutation in the SFV E1 fusion protein was sufficient to confer partial resistance against obatoclax. Other inhibitors that target the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins inhibited neither viral entry nor endolysosomal acidification, suggesting that the antiviral mechanism of obatoclax does not depend on its anticancer targets. Obatoclax inhibited the growth of flaviviruses, like Zika virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus, which require low pH for fusion, but not that of pH-independent picornaviruses, like coxsackievirus A9, echovirus 6, and echovirus 7. In conclusion, obatoclax is a novel inhibitor of endosomal acidification that prevents viral fusion and that could be pursued as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral candidate.

"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), known to play an important role in vascular homeostasis, vascular integrity and angiogenesis, is little known about the evolutionary relationship of its five members especially the role of gene duplication and natural selection in the evolution of the VEGF family. In this study, seventy-five full-length cDNA sequences from 33 vertebrate species were extracted from the NCBI's GenBank, UniProt protein database and the Ensembl database. By phylogenetic analyses, we investigated the origin, conservation, and evolution of the VEGFs. Five VEGF family members in vertebrates might be formed by gene duplication. The inferred evolutionary transitions that separate members which belong to different gene clusters correlated with changes in functional properties. Selection analysis and protein structure analysis were combined to explain the relationship of the site-specific evolution in the vertebrate VEGF family. Eleven positive selection sites, one transmembrane region and the active sites were detected in this process.

"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a pluripotent lipid mediator acting through plasma membrane-associated LPA(x) receptors that transduce many, but not all, of its effects. We identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) as an intracellular receptor for LPA. The transcription factor PPARgamma is activated by several lipid ligands, but agonists derived from physiologic signaling pathways are unknown. We show that LPA, but not its precursor phosphatidic acid, displaces the drug rosiglitazone from the ligand-binding pocket of PPARgamma. LPA and novel LPA analogs we made stimulated expression of a PPAR-responsive element reporter and the endogenous PPARgamma-controlled gene CD36, and induced monocyte lipid accumulation from oxidized low-density lipoprotein via the CD36 scavenger receptor. The synthetic LPA analogs were effective PPARgamma agonists, but were poor ones for LPA(1), LPA(2), or LPA(3) receptor transfected cells. Transfection studies in yeast, which lack nuclear hormone and LPA(x) receptors, show that LPA directly activates PPARgamma. A major growth factor of serum is LPA generated by thrombin-activated platelets, and media from activated platelets stimulated PPARgamma function in transfected RAW264.7 macrophages. This function was suppressed by ectopic LPA-acyltransferase expression. LPA is a physiologic PPARgamma ligand, placing PPARgamma in a signaling pathway, and PPARgamma is the first intracellular receptor identified for LPA. Moreover, LPA produced by stimulated plasma platelets activates PPARgamma in nucleated cells.

"Antigenic relationships among 20 strains of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) viruses isolated in Korea, China, U.S.S.R., Finland, Japan and U.S.A. were examined with rat immune sera, patient sera, eight monoclonal antibodies against the SR-11 strain and 10 monoclonal antibodies against the 76-118 strain. Antigen analyses by indirect immunofluorescent antibody and immune adherence haemagglutination tests using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that HRFS viruses may be divided into four serotypes, i.e. Apodemus (Type 1), Rattus (Type 2), Clethrionomys (Type 3) and Microtus (Type 4). Further, it was demonstrated that Type 1 could be divided into three subtypes and Type 3 into two subtypes. The two sets of monoclonal antibodies were useful for identification of the antigenic types of viruses isolated from patients in endemic areas.

"Reduction of viral surrogates (bacteriophage MS2 and murine norovirus-1 [MNV-1]) and viruses naturally present in wastewater (enteroviruses, adenoviruses, Aichi viruses, reovirus, pepper mild mottle virus) was studied in a long-term experiment simulating soil-aquifer treatment of a non-disinfected secondary treated wastewater effluent blend using a 4.4 m deep saturated soil column (95% sand, 4% silt, 1% clay) with a hydraulic residence time of 15.4 days under predominantly anoxic redox conditions. Water samples were collected over a four-week period from the column inflow and outflow as well as from seven intermediate sampling ports at different depths. Removal of MS2 was 3.5 log(10) over 4.4 m and removal of MNV-1 was 3 log(10) over 0.3 m. Notably, MNV-1 was removed to below detection limit within 0.3 m of soil passage. In secondary treated wastewater effluent, MNV-1 RNA and MS2 RNA degraded at a first-order rate of 0.59 day(-1) and 0.12 day(-1), respectively. In 15.4 days, the time to pass the soil column, the RNA-degradation of MS2 would amount to 0.8 log(10,) and in one day that of MNV-1 0.3 log(10) implying that attachment of MNV-1 and MS2 to the sandy soil took place. Among the indigenous viruses, genome copies reductions were observed for Aichi virus (4.9 log(10)) and for pepper mild mottle virus (4.4 log(10)). This study demonstrated that under saturated flow and predominantly anoxic redox conditions MS2 removal was non-linear and could be described well by a power-law relation. Pepper mild mottle virus was removed less than all of the other viruses studied, which substantiates field studies at managed aquifer recharge sites, suggesting it may be a conservative model/tracer for enteric virus transport through soil.

"This report describes the discovery and characterization of a new fusogenic orthoreovirus, Broome virus (BroV), isolated from a little red flying-fox (Pteropus scapulatus). The BroV genome consists of 10 dsRNA segments, each having a 3' terminal pentanucleotide sequence conserved amongst all members of the genus Orthoreovirus, and a unique 5' terminal pentanucleotide sequence. The smallest genome segment is bicistronic and encodes two small nonstructural proteins, one of which is a novel fusion associated small transmembrane (FAST) protein responsible for syncytium formation, but no cell attachment protein. The low amino acid sequence identity between BroV proteins and those of other orthoreoviruses (13-50%), combined with phylogenetic analyses of structural and nonstructural proteins provide evidence to support the classification of BroV in a new sixth species group within the genus Orthoreovirus.

"ERV9 is a class I family of human endogenous retroviral sequences. Somatic cell hybrid genomic hybridization experiments using a mono-chromosomal panel indicate the presence of approximately 120 ERV9 loci in the human genome distributed on most chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using an ERV9 cDNA probe containing gag, pol and env sequences, verified this observation and a consistent signal was found at the chromosome region 11q13.3-->q13.5. By analysis of a panel of radiation hybrids, an ERV9 locus was mapped to within a 300-kbp region at the chromosome site 11q13. The marker cCLGW567 and the locus MAP3K11/D11S546 centromeric and telomeric flanked it, respectively. Northern blot analysis, using an ERV9 LTR probe, indicated that most normal tissues examined expressed low abundant ERV9 LTR driven mRNAs of various sizes. The most prominent expression was found in adrenal glands and testis. However, the level of expression varied in the same tissues among different individuals indicating that ERV9 mRNA expression probably is inducible in certain tissues or at various cell stages.

"Mg(2+) is required at micromolar concentrations as a cofactor for ATP, enzymatic reactions, and other biological processes. We show that decreased extracellular Mg(2+) reduced intracellular Mg(2+) levels and impaired the Ca(2+) flux, activation marker up-regulation, and proliferation after T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Reduced Mg(2+) specifically impairs TCR signal transduction by IL-2-inducible T cell kinase (ITK) due to a requirement for a regulatory Mg(2+) in the catalytic pocket of ITK. We also show that altered catalytic efficiency by millimolar changes in free basal Mg(2+) is an unrecognized but conserved feature of other serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, suggesting a Mg(2+) regulatory paradigm of kinase function. Finally, a reduced serum Mg(2+) concentration in mice causes an impaired CD8(+) T cell response to influenza A virus infection, reduces T cell activation, and exacerbates morbidity. Thus, Mg(2+) directly regulates the active site of specific kinases during T cell responses, and maintaining a high serum Mg(2+) concentration is important for antiviral immunity in otherwise healthy animals.

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a calicivirus of the genus Lagovirus that causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in adult European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). First described in China in 1984, the virus rapidly spread worldwide and is nowadays considered as endemic in several countries. In Australia and New Zealand where rabbits are pests, RHDV was purposely introduced for rabbit biocontrol. Factors that may have precipitated RHD emergence remain unclear, but non-pathogenic strains seem to pre-date the appearance of the pathogenic strains suggesting a key role for the comprehension of the virus origins. All pathogenic strains are classified within one single serotype, but two subtypes are recognised, RHDV and RHDVa. RHD causes high mortality in both domestic and wild adult animals, with individuals succumbing between 48-72 h post-infection. No other species has been reported to be fatally susceptible to RHD. The disease is characterised by acute necrotising hepatitis, but haemorrhages may also be found in other organs, in particular the lungs, heart, and kidneys due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Resistance to the disease might be explained in part by genetically determined absence or weak expression of attachment factors, but humoral immunity is also important. Disease control in rabbitries relies mainly on vaccination and biosecurity measures. Such measures are difficult to be implemented in wild populations. More recent research has indicated that RHDV might be used as a molecular tool for therapeutic applications. Although the study of RHDV and RHD has been hampered by the lack of an appropriate cell culture system for the virus, several aspects of the replication, epizootology, epidemiology and evolution have been disclosed. This review provides a broad coverage and description of the current knowledge on the disease and the virus.

"Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a disease of viral etiology that affects humans causing severe acute respiratory symptoms. In Patagonia the disease is caused by the Andes Virus (AND) and transmitted by the rodent Oligoryzomys longicaudatus. The aim of this study was to identify those human activities that increase the risk of exposure to rodents, what we call ""contagious scenarios"". A retrospective study was performed with data obtained from cases in Rio Negro, which included clinic-epidemiological records and ecological/environmental assessment reports. The following variables were considered: age, sex, season, percentage of urbanization, geographic location, human settlements in rodent infested areas, probable source of exposure, type of activity and level of sanitary development. In total 32 cases were studied. Exposure was verified in 18 (56.2 %) cases in rural areas and 10 cases (31.3%) in small rural towns. In relation to anthropogenic environment, 24 (75%) cases were reported in developed settlements and 8 cases (25%) were related to slightly modified areas. Major exposition in El Bolson identified 8 cases of indoor activities of the total 18 reported in the area (44.5%), while in Bariloche 8 (57.1%) cases out of 14 were reported in outdoor surroundings. In general, activities that generated greater risk were work-related, accounting for 23 (71.9%) cases while 7 were related to recreational activities (28.1%). The identification of ""contagious scenarios"" at local level provided information for an effective application of available resources in terms of prevention and sanitary education.

"Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emerging arbovirus of the Americas that may cause a debilitating arthritogenic disease. The biology of MAYV is not fully understood and largely inferred from related arthritogenic alphaviruses. Here, we present the structure of MAYV at 4.4 Å resolution, obtained from a preparation of mature, infective virions. MAYV presents typical alphavirus features and organization. Interactions between viral proteins that lead to particle formation are described together with a hydrophobic pocket formed between E1 and E2 spike proteins and conformational epitopes specific of MAYV. We also describe MAYV glycosylation residues in E1 and E2 that may affect MXRA8 host receptor binding, and a molecular ""handshake"" between MAYV spikes formed by N262 glycosylation in adjacent E2 proteins. The structure of MAYV is suggestive of structural and functional complexity among alphaviruses, which may be targeted for specificity or antiviral activity.

"Polyomavirus large and small T antigens cooperate in the induction of S phase in serum-deprived Swiss 3T3 cells. While the large T antigen is able to induce S phase-specific enzymes, we have recently shown that both T antigens contribute to the production of the cyclins E and A and that the small T antigen is essential for the induction of cyclin A-dependent cdk2 activity (S. Schüchner and E. Wintersberger, J. Virol. 73:9266-9273, 1999). Here we present our attempts to elucidate the mechanisms by which the large and the small T antigens transactivate the murine cyclin A gene. Using Swiss 3T3 cells carrying the T antigens and various mutants thereof under the hormone-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter, as well as transient-cotransfection experiments with the T antigens and cyclin A promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, we found the following. The large T antigen activates the cyclin A promoter via two transcription factor binding sites, a cyclic AMP responsive element (CRE), and the major negative regulatory site called CDE-CHR. While an intact binding site for pocket proteins is required for the function of this T antigen at the CDE-CHR, its activity at the CRE is largely independent thereof. In contrast, an intact J domain and an intact zinc finger are required at both sites. The small T antigen also appears to have an influence on the cyclin A promoter through the CRE as well as the CDE-CHR. For this an interaction with protein phosphatase 2A is essential; mutation of the J domain does not totally eliminate but greatly reduces the transactivating ability.

"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most frequent cause of blindness in patients >60 years, affecting ~30 million people worldwide. AMD is a multifactorial disease influenced by environmental and genetic factors, which lead to functional impairment of the retina due to retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell degeneration followed by photoreceptor degradation. An ideal treatment would include the transplantation of healthy RPE cells secreting neuroprotective factors to prevent RPE cell death and photoreceptor degeneration. Due to the functional and genetic similarities and the possibility of a less invasive biopsy, the transplantation of iris pigment epithelial (IPE) cells was proposed as a substitute for the degenerated RPE. Secretion of neuroprotective factors by a low number of subretinally-transplanted cells can be achieved by Sleeping Beauty (SB100X) transposon-mediated transfection with genes coding for the pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and/or the granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We established the isolation, culture, and SB100X-mediated transfection of RPE and IPE cells from various species including rodents, pigs, and cattle. Globes are explanted and the cornea and lens are removed to access the iris and the retina. Using a custom-made spatula, IPE cells are removed from the isolated iris. To harvest RPE cells, a trypsin incubation may be required, depending on the species. Then, using RPE-customized spatula, cells are suspended in medium. After seeding, cells are monitored twice per week and, after reaching confluence, transfected by electroporation. Gene integration, expression, protein secretion, and function were confirmed by qPCR, WB, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and functional assays. Depending on the species, 30,000-5 million (RPE) and 10,000-1.5 million (IPE) cells can be isolated per eye. Genetically modified cells show significant PEDF/GM-CSF overexpression with the capacity to reduce oxidative stress and offers a flexible system for ex vivo analyses and in vivo studies transferable to humans to develop ocular gene therapy approaches.

"The emergence of numerous variants of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has presented new challenges to the global efforts to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we obtain two cross-neutralizing antibodies (7D6 and 6D6) that target Sarbecoviruses' receptor-binding domain (RBD) with sub-picomolar affinities and potently neutralize authentic SARS-CoV-2. Crystal structures show that both antibodies bind a cryptic site different from that recognized by existing antibodies and highly conserved across Sarbecovirus isolates. Binding of these two antibodies to the RBD clashes with the adjacent N-terminal domain and disrupts the viral spike. Both antibodies confer good resistance to mutations in the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Thus, our results have direct relevance to public health as options for passive antibody therapeutics and even active prophylactics. They can also inform the design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.

"Lagoviruses belong to the Caliciviridae family. They were first recognized as highly pathogenic viruses of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and European brown hare (Lepus europaeus) that emerged in the 1970-1980s, namely, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV), according to the host species from which they had been first detected. However, the diversity of lagoviruses has recently expanded to include new related viruses with varying pathogenicity, geographic distribution and host ranges. Together with the frequent recombination observed amongst circulating viruses, there is a clear need to establish precise guidelines for classifying and naming lagovirus strains. Therefore, here we propose a new nomenclature based on phylogenetic relationships. In this new nomenclature, a single species of lagovirus would be recognized and called Lagovirus europaeus. The species would be divided into two genogroups that correspond to RHDV- and EBHSV-related viruses, respectively. Genogroups could be subdivided into genotypes, which could themselves be subdivided into phylogenetically well-supported variants. Based on available sequences, pairwise distance cutoffs have been defined, but with the accumulation of new sequences these cutoffs may need to be revised. We propose that an international working group could coordinate the nomenclature of lagoviruses and any proposals for revision.

"Genetically engineered herpes simplex virus ICP34.5 null mutants replicate only in dividing cells and have shown potential for the treatment of malignant disease, including glioma. Phase I trials have demonstrated the safety of these viruses in various clinical settings but it is envisaged that for full efficacy they will be used in combination with other therapeutic modalities. To enhance virus-induced tumour cytotoxicity, we have engineered an ICP34.5 null mutant (HSV1716) of HSV1 which expresses the noradrenaline transporter gene (NAT). This virus is designated HSV1716/NAT. We have shown previously that introduction of the NAT gene into a range of tumour cells, via plasmid-mediated transfection, conferred the capacity for active uptake of the radiopharmaceutical [131I]MIBG and resulted in dose-dependent toxicity. In this study, combination therapy utilising HSV1716/NAT and [131I]MIBG was assessed in vitro by the MTT assay. We demonstrate that the NAT gene, introduced by HSV1716/NAT into cultured glioma cells, was expressed 1 h after viral infection, enabling active uptake of [131I]MIBG. The combination of viral oncolysis and induced radiopharmaceutical uptake resulted in significantly enhanced cytotoxicity compared to either agent alone and the response was dose- and time-dependent. These studies show that the combination of oncolytic HSV therapy with targeted radiotherapy has the potential for effective tumour cell kill and warrants further investigation as a treatment for malignant glioma.

"The fate and transport of microbes in groundwater are controlled by physicochemical characteristics of the microbe and of the groundwater/aquifer media. Key characteristics of the microbe include size, inactivation (die-off) rate, and surface electrostatic properties. Key properties of the groundwater/aquifer system include flow velocity, aquifer grain (or pore) size, porosity, solid organic carbon content, temperature, pH, and other chemical characteristics of water and mineral composition. Because of size and surface electrical properties, viruses are much more mobile in groundwater than Cryptosporidium and Giardia (which are about 100 times or more larger than viruses). The inactivation or die-off rate is usually the most important factor governing how far microbes can migrate in significant numbers in groundwater. Typical half-lives of microbes in groundwater range from a few hours to a few weeks. Examples of maximum reported migration distances of microbes in groundwater include: bacteria, 600 m in a sandy aquifer: viruses, 1000 to 1600 m in channeled limestones and 250 to 408 m in glacial silt-sand aquifers; Cryptosporidium and Giardia, no confirmed reports found of significant migration distances. Investigations by the EPA have indicated that distances of 210 to 325 m away from septic tanks are necessary to achieve with high confidence an 11 order of magnitude reduction in virus concentrations.

"BACKGROUND: Teratomas are germ cell neoplasms composed of a wide variety of tissues. In the woodchuck, only one testicular teratoma has been described in the literature. The objective of this report was to describe the radiologic and pathologic findings in a female woodchuck (Marmota monax) with an ovarian teratoma consisting of mature tissues originating from all three germ layers. CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old female woodchuck that had been infected at birth with woodchuck hepatitis virus and subsequently developed hepatocellular carcinoma was incidentally discovered to have a mobile 6.6 × 4.8 × 4.7 cm abdominal mass on computed tomography (CT) imaging. The tumor was predominantly solid and heterogenous on CT with soft tissue, fat, and areas of dense calcification. The teratoma did not enhance with intravenous contrast administration. On ultrasound, the tumor was solid with heterogeneous echogenicity, reflecting the fat content and areas of calcification. Sonolucent areas were present that may have represented cysts. There was heterogeneously increased signal on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and heterogeneous hyperintensity in T2-weighted imaging. Fat was evident within the tumor. At necropsy, the tumor was attached to the distal end of the right uterine horn. Histopathology showed mature tissue types representing all three germ layers. CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian teratoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of ovarian or abdominal masses in woodchucks. The tumor displayed mature tissue derived from all three germ layers. CT, ultrasound, and MRI findings were presented in detail and matched the typical imaging appearance of teratomas.

"BACKGROUND: Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has caused several epidemics of hand, foot and mouth diseases (HFMD) in Asia and now is being recognized as an important neurotropic virus. Effective medications and prophylactic vaccine against EV71 infection are urgently needed. Based on the success of inactivated poliovirus vaccine, a prototype chemically inactivated EV71 vaccine candidate has been developed and currently in human phase 1 clinical trial. PRINCIPAL FINDING: In this report, we present the development of a serum-free cell-based EV71 vaccine. The optimization at each step of the manufacturing process was investigated, characterized and quantified. In the up-stream process development, different commercially available cell culture media either containing serum or serum-free was screened for cell growth and virus yield using the roller-bottle technology. VP-SFM serum-free medium was selected based on the Vero cell growth profile and EV71 virus production. After the up-stream processes (virus harvest, diafiltration and concentration), a combination of gel-filtration liquid chromatography and/or sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation down-stream purification processes were investigated at a pilot scale of 40 liters each. Although the combination of chromatography and sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation produced extremely pure EV71 infectious virus particles, the overall yield of vaccine was 7-10% as determined by a VP2-based quantitative ELISA. Using chromatography as the downstream purification, the virus yield was 30-43%. To retain the integrity of virus neutralization epitopes and the stability of the vaccine product, the best virus inactivation was found to be 0.025% formalin-treatment at 37 °C for 3 to 6 days. Furthermore, the formalin-inactivated virion vaccine candidate was found to be stable for >18 months at 4 °C and a microgram of viral proteins formulated with alum adjuvant could induce strong virus-neutralizing antibody responses in mice, rats, rabbits, and non-human primates. CONCLUSION: These results provide valuable information supporting the current cell-based serum-free EV71 vaccine candidate going into human Phase I clinical trials.

"There remains a substantial gap in our understandings of the life experiences of patients following HCV cure among HIV-HCV-co-infected people who inject drugs (PWID) and men who have sex with men (MSM), two key populations targeted for HCV elimination. We described the experiences and perspectives of HIV-positive PWID and MSM, HCV-cured following treatment with direct-acting antivirals (DAA). We used an exploratory sequential mixed approach using both qualitative data (semi-structured interviews with 27 PWID and 20 MSM) and quantitative data (self-administered questionnaires with 89 PWID) via the prospective ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. PWID reported improvements in physical health-related quality of life (HRQL) and self-reported symptoms following treatment, but no significant change in mental HRQL. During interviews, several MSM, more recently diagnosed with HCV, expressed less concern regarding HCV than HIV infection and interpreted improvements in their overall well-being after HCV cure to be more related to a closer connection with healthcare providers than with viral elimination. By contrast, PWID, particularly those previously exposed to interferon-based treatments, described major improvements in their physical HRQL. Both MSM and PWID reported improvements in cognitive or psychological wellbeing, and a majority of them reported some degree of concern over potential HCV reinfection. To conclude, though health benefits of HCV cure concern both groups, HIV-infected PWID and MSM may have different representations and experiences following DAA treatment, related to their history with HCV. They are thus likely to benefit from holistic, post-treatment follow-up care that is responsive to their evolving health and social contexts.

"Filtration of Bacillus subtilis spores and the F-RNA phage MS2 (MS2) on a field scale in a coarse alluvial gravel aquifer was evaluated from the authors' previously published data. An advection-dispersion model that is coupled with first-order attachment kinetics was used in this study to interpret microbial concentration vs. time breakthrough curves (BTC) at sampling wells. Based on attachment rates (katt) that were determined by applying the model to the breakthrough data, filter factors (f) were calculated and compared with f values estimated from the slopes of log (cmax/co) vs. distance plots. These two independent approaches resulted in nearly identical filter factors, suggesting that both approaches are useful in determining reductions in microbial concentrations over transport distance. Applying the graphic approach to analyse spatial data, we have also estimated the f values for different aquifers using information provided by some other published field studies. The results show that values of f, in units of log (cmax/co) m(-1), are consistently in the order of 10(-2) for clean coarse gravel aquifers, 10(-3) for contaminated coarse gravel aquifers, and generally 10(-1) for sandy fine gravel aquifers and river and coastal sand aquifers. For each aquifer category, the f values for bacteriophages and bacteria are in the same order-of-magnitude. The f values estimated in this study indicate that for every one-log reduction in microbial concentration in groundwater, it requires a few tens of meters of travel in clean coarse gravel aquifers, but a few hundreds of meters in contaminated coarse gravel aquifers. In contrast, a one-log reduction generally only requires a few meters of travel in sandy fine gravel aquifers and sand aquifers. Considering the highest concentration in human effluent is in the order of 10(4) pfu/l for enteroviruses and 10(6) cfu/100 ml for faecal coliform bacteria, a 7-log reduction in microbial concentration would comply with the drinking water standards for the downgradient wells under natural gradient conditions. Based on the results of this study, a 7-log reduction would require 125-280 m travel in clean coarse gravel aquifers, 1.7-3.9 km travel in contaminated coarse gravel aquifers, 33-61 m travel in clean sandy fine gravel aquifers, 33-129 m travel in contaminated sandy fine gravel aquifers, and 37-44 m travel in contaminated river and coastal sand aquifers. These recommended setback distances are for a worst-case scenario, assuming direct discharge of raw effluent into the saturated zone of an aquifer. Filtration theory was applied to calculate collision efficiency (alpha) from model-derived attachment rates (katt), and the results are compared with those reported in the literature. The calculated alpha values vary by two orders-of-magnitude, depending on whether collision efficiency is estimated from the effective particle size (d10) or the mean particle size (d50). Collision efficiency values for MS-2 are similar to those previously reported in the literature (e.g. ) [DeBorde, D.C., Woessner, W.W., Kiley, QT., Ball, P., 1999. Rapid transport of viruses in a floodplain aquifer. Water Res. 33 (10), 2229-2238]. However, the collision efficiency values calculated for Bacillus subtilis spores were unrealistic, suggesting that filtration theory is not appropriate for theoretically estimating filtration capacity for poorly sorted coarse gravel aquifer media. This is not surprising, as filtration theory was developed for uniform sand filters and does not consider particle size distribution. Thus, we do not recommend the use of filtration theory to estimate the filter factor or setback distances. Either of the methods applied in this work (BTC or concentration vs. distance analyses), which takes into account aquifer heterogeneities and site-specific conditions, appear to be most useful in determining filter factors and setback distances.

"Simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA molecules chromosomally integrated at different sites in three Chinese hamster lung fibroblast lines replicated during the middle portion of S phase but not precisely at the same time in all three cell lines. The time of replication was unrelated to the presence of T antigen or to its relative activity in promoting SV40 replication. SV40 sequences and chromosomal DNA sequences adjacent to the SV40 insert in one cell line expressing a temperature-sensitive T antigen showed a T-antigen-independent difference in replication timing from the homologous, allelic locus not linked to SV40. Our results indicate that the timing of replication of these integrated SV40 molecules is dependent upon the site of integration and is not determined by the level of T antigen replication-promoting activity.

"Many recessive resistances against potyviruses are mediated by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). In tobacco, the va resistance gene commonly used to control Potato virus Y (PVY) corresponds to a large deletion affecting the eIF4E-1 gene on chromosome 21. Here, we compared the resistance durability conferred by various types of mutations affecting eIF4E-1 (deletions of various sizes, frameshift or nonsense mutations). The 'large deletion' genotypes displayed the broadest and most durable resistance, whereas frameshift and nonsense mutants displayed a less durable resistance, with rapid and frequent apparition of resistance-breaking variants. In addition, genetic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that resistance durability is strongly impacted by a complex genetic locus on chromosome 14, which contains three other eIF4E genes. One of these, eIF4E-3, is rearranged as a hybrid gene between eIF4E-2 and eIF4E-3 (eIF4E-(2-3) ) in the genotypes showing the most durable resistance, while eIF4E-2 is differentially expressed between the tested varieties. RNA-seq and quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrated that eIF4E-2 expression level is positively correlated with resistance durability. These results suggest that besides the nature of the mutation affecting eIF4E-1, three factors linked with a complex locus may potentially impact va durability: loss of an integral eIF4E-3, presence of eIF4E-(2-3) and overexpression of eIF4E-2. This latter gene might act as a decoy in a non-productive virus-plant interaction, limiting the ability of PVY to evolve towards resistance breaking. Taken together, these results show that va resistance durability can in large part be explained by complex redundancy effects in the eIF4E gene family.

"Fanconi anemia (FA) patients are highly susceptible to solid tumors at multiple anatomical sites including head and neck region. A subset of head and neck cancers (HNCs) is associated with 'high-risk' HPVs, particularly HPV16. However, the correlation between HPV oncogenes and cancers in FA patients is still unclear. We previously learned that FA deficiency in mice predisposes HPV16 E7 transgenic mice to HNCs. To address HPV16 E6's oncogenic potential under FA deficiency in HNCs, we utilized HPV16 E6-transgenic mice (K14E6) and HPV16 E6/E7-bi-transgenic mice (K14E6E7) on genetic backgrounds sufficient or deficient for one of the fanc genes, fancD2 and monitored their susceptibility to HNCs. K14E6 mice failed to develop tumor. However, E6 and fancD2-deficiency accelerated E7-driven tumor development in K14E6E7 mice. The increased tumor incidence was more correlated with E7-driven DNA damage than proliferation. We also found that deficiency of pocket proteins, pRb, p107, and p130 that are well-established targets of E7, could recapitulate E7's induction of DNA damage. Our findings support the hypothesis that E7 induces HPV-associated HNCs by promoting DNA damage through the inactivation of pocket proteins, which explains why a deficiency in DNA damage repair would increase susceptibility to E7-driven cancer. Our results further demonstrate the unexpected finding that FA deficiency does not predispose E6 transgenic mice to HNCs, indicating a specificity in the synergy between FA deficiency and HPV oncogenes in causing HNCs.

"Scutellaria baicalensis (SB) and SB-derived polyphenols possess anti-proliferative activities in several cancers, including pancreatic cancer (PaCa). However, the precise molecular mechanisms have not been fully defined. SB extract and SB-derived polyphenols (wogonin, baicalin, and baicalein) were used to determine their anti-proliferative mechanisms. Baicalein significantly inhibited the proliferation of PaCa cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, whereas wogonin and baicalin exhibited a much less robust effect. Treatment with baicalein induced apoptosis with release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and activation of caspase-3 and -7 and PARP. The general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk reversed baicalein-induced apoptosis, indicating a caspase-dependent mechanism. Baicalein decreased expression of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family, presumably through a transcriptional mechanism. Genetic knockdown of Mcl-1 resulted in marked induction of apoptosis. The effect of baicalein on apoptosis was significantly attenuated by Mcl-1 over-expression, suggesting a critical role of Mcl-1 in this process. Our results provide evidence that baicalein induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells through down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein.

"XTT can be metabolically reduced by mitochondrial dehydrogenase in viable cells to a water-soluble formazan product. Thus XTT has been widely used to evaluate cell viability and to screen anti-HIV agents and the cytotoxicity of these agents. The present studies demonstrated that XTT formazan derived from XTT in cell culture significantly inhibits the fusion of HIV-1-infected cells with uninfected cells. Synthetic XTT formazan effectively inhibited the replication of laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates and cell-to-cell fusion with low cytotoxicity. It blocks the six-helix bundle formation between peptides derived from the N- and C-terminal heptad repeat regions of the gp41 ectodomain (designated N- and C-peptides, respectively). Analysis by a computer-aided docking program indicates that XTT formazan may bind to the highly conserved hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the central trimeric coiled coil of gp41. These results suggest that XTT formazan inhibits HIV-1 entry by targeting the alpha-helical coiled-coil domain of gp41. This small molecular nonpeptide antiviral compound can be used as a lead for designing more effective HIV-1 entry inhibitors targeting the fusion stage of HIV-1 infection. But because XTT formazan itself has anti-HIV-1 activity, caution should be exercised when XTT is used to evaluate HIV-1 infectivity.

"BACKGROUND: Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a key transcription factor in hypoxia, affects a wide range of adaptive cell functions. We examined the kinetics of endogenous HIF-1alpha during acute and chronic rejection, and the effect of exogenous HIF-1alpha in chronically rejecting rat cardiac allografts. METHODS: Heterotopic cardiac transplantations were performed between major MHC-mismatched Dark Agouti and Wistar-Furth rats. Cyclosporine A (CsA) was used to prevent acute rejection in the chronic rejection model. The effect of HIF-1alpha overexpression was investigated by adeno-assocated virus 2 (AAV2)-mediated gene transfer of a constitutively stabilized form of mouse HIF-1alpha (AAV-HIF-1alpha). The analysis of allografts was based on histology, immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcript-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Acute and chronic rejection significantly induced HIF-1alpha mRNA in rat cardiac allografts when compared with syngeneic controls. Immunohistochemistry localized significantly increased HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity to vascular smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial cells, post-capillary venules and graft-infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells of the allograft, whereas expression in cardiomyocytes remained unchanged. Regression analysis revealed a linear correlation between the progression of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) and HIF-1alpha immunoreactivity in post-capillary venules and graft-infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells in chronically rejecting rat cardiac allografts. AAV-HIF-1alpha enhanced cardiomyocyte HIF-1alpha production and significantly reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the development of CAV in chronically rejecting rat cardiac allografts. CONCLUSIONS: We found that acute and chronic rejection increased HIF-1alpha mRNA and protein levels in rat cardiac allografts. On the other hand, cardiomyocyte-targeted HIF-1alpha gene transfer inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis and the development of CAV, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for HIF-1alpha in cardiac allografts.

"The HGP-write project, announced in 2016 but not really implemented yet, comes back as a project aimed at constructing an ""ultra-safe"" human cell line fully resistant to virus infection and with other desirable characteristics. This involves introducing 400,000 changes in the genome and raises a number of technical and financial issues, but may become realistic in mid-term.

"N-linked glycans are composed of three major types: high-mannose (Man), hybrid or complex. The functional role of hybrid- and complex-type N-glycans in Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection and fusion was examined in N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnT I)-deficient Lec1 cells, a mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell incapable of synthesizing hybrid- and complex-type N-glycans. We used recombinant NDV expressing green fluorescence protein or red fluorescence protein to monitor NDV infection, syncytium formation and viral yield. Flow cytometry showed that CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells had essentially the same degree of NDV infection. In contrast, Lec2 cells were found to be resistant to NDV infection. Compared with CHO-K1 cells, Lec1 cells were shown to more sensitive to fusion induced by NDV. Viral attachment was found to be comparable in both lines. We found that there were no significant differences in the yield of progeny virus produced by both CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells. Quantitative analysis revealed that NDV infection and fusion in Lec1 cells were also inhibited by treatment with sialidase. Pretreatment of Lec1 cells with Galanthus nivalis agglutinin specific for terminal α1-3-linked Man prior to inoculation with NDV rendered Lec1 cells less sensitive to cell-to-cell fusion compared with mock-treated Lec1 cells. Treatment of CHO-K1 and Lec1 cells with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, significantly blocked fusion and infection. In conclusion, our results suggest that hybrid- and complex-type N-glycans are not required for NDV infection and fusion. We propose that high-Man-type N-glycans could play an important role in the cell-to-cell fusion induced by NDV.

"Experiments were conducted to evaluate the impact of groundwater chemistry and travel distance on the transport and fate behavior of PRD-1, a bacteriophage employed as a surrogate tracer for pathogenic enteric viruses. The experiments were conducted in the unconfined aquifer at the United States Geological Survey Cape Cod Toxic-Substances Hydrology Research Site in Falmouth, Massachusetts. The transport behavior of bromide (Br(-)) and PRD-1 were evaluated in a sewage-effluent contaminated zone and a shallower uncontaminated zone at this site. Several multilevel sampling devices located along a 13-m transect were used to collect vertically discrete samples to examine longitudinal and vertical variability of PRD-1 retardation and attenuation. The concentration of viable bacteriophage in the aqueous phase decreased greatly during the first few meters of transport. This decrease is attributed to a combination of colloid filtration (attachment) and inactivation. The removal was greater (10(-12) relative recovery) and occurred within the first meter for the uncontaminated zone, whereas it was lesser (10(-9) relative recovery) and occurred over 4m in the contaminated zone. The lesser removal observed for the contaminated zone is attributed to the influence of sorbed and dissolved organic matter, phosphate, and other anions, which are present in higher concentrations in the contaminated zone, on PRD-1 attachment. After the initial decrease, the aqueous PRD-1 concentrations remained essentially constant in both zones for the remainder of the tests (total travel distances of 13 m), irrespective of variations in geochemical properties within and between the two zones. The viable, mobile PRD-1 particles traveled at nearly the rate of bromide, which was used as a non-reactive tracer. The results of this study indicate that a small fraction of viable virus particles may persist in the aqueous phase and travel significant distances in the subsurface environment.

"There is great interest in the development of Ab-inducing subunit vaccines targeting infections, including HIV, malaria, and Ebola. We previously reported that adenovirus vectored vaccines are potent in priming Ab responses, but uncertainty remains regarding the optimal approach for induction of humoral immune responses. In this study, using OVA as a model Ag, we assessed the magnitude of the primary and anamnestic Ag-specific IgG responses of mice to four clinically relevant vaccine formulations: replication-deficient adenovirus; modified vaccinia Ankara (a poxvirus); protein with alum; and protein in the squalene oil-in-water adjuvant Addavax. We then used flow cytometric assays capable of measuring total and Ag-specific germinal center (GC) B cell and follicular Th cell responses to compare the induction of these responses by the different formulations. We report that adenovirus vectored vaccines induce Ag insert-specific GC B cell and Ab responses of a magnitude comparable to those induced by a potent protein/squalene oil-in-water formulation whereas-despite a robust overall GC response-the insert-specific GC B cell and Ab responses induced by modified vaccinia Ankara were extremely weak. Ag-specific follicular Th cell responses to adenovirus vectored vaccines exceeded those induced by other platforms at day 7 after immunization. We found little evidence that innate immune activation by adenovirus may act as an adjuvant in such a manner that the humoral response to a recombinant protein may be enhanced by coadministering with an adenovirus lacking a transgene of interest. Overall, these studies provide further support for the use of replication-deficient adenoviruses to induce humoral responses.

"Recently, human cases of nephropathia epidemica (NE) due to Puumala virus infection in Europe have increased. Following the hypothesis that high reservoir host abundance induces higher transmission rates to humans, explanations for this altered epidemiology must be sought in factors that cause bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance peaks. In Western Europe, these abundance peaks are often related to high tree seed production, which is supposedly triggered by specific weather conditions. We evaluated the relationship between tree seed production, climate and NE incidence in Belgium and show that NE epidemics are indeed preceded by abundant tree seed production. Moreover, a direct link between climate and NE incidence is found. High summer and autumn temperatures, 2 years and 1 year respectively before NE occurrence, relate to high NE incidence. This enables early forecasting of NE outbreaks. Since future climate change scenarios predict higher temperatures in Europe, we should regard Puumala virus as an increasing health threat.

"Non-viral DNA-containing particles represent a potentially attractive alternative to viruses for in vivo gene therapy applications. However, the inability to form small particles that remain stable and non-aggregating in vivo has limited their usefulness to date. The relatively simple self-assembling complexes that function so efficiently for in vitro gene delivery fail to provide similar gene delivery capabilities in vivo. Now for the first time, significant advances are being made into defining many of the in vivo barriers preventing stable particle formation. This improved understanding has been manifested into a rational design approach to DNA particle formation. This review highlights many of the recent studies in which rational design was employed in an effort to form polymer/DNA particles (polyplexes) that resist in vivo aggregation and inactivation.

"Myxomatosis, a major disease of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), is enzootic on several continents. The disease is infectious, virulent and contagious. The pathogen is a virus of the family Poxviridae, genus Leporipoxvirus. In its classic form the disease is often fatal, characterised by severe immunosuppression and the appearance of skin pseudotumours (myxomas); it is conducive to effective mechanical transmission by many biting arthropods. Atypical clinical forms, referred to as amyxomatous, of variable severity and with an apparent preference for direct transmission, have recently emerged in Europe. Virus-host interactions have been particularly well studied since the voluntary introduction of the myxoma virus into Australia and Europe, revealing a remarkable process of co-evolution. Molecular analysis has recently demonstrated the extraordinary evolutionary capacity of the myxoma virus.

"The glycoprotein complex (GPC) of arenaviruses, composed of stable signal peptide, GP1, and GP2, is the only antigen correlated with antibody-mediated neutralization. However, despite strong cross-reactivity of convalescent antisera between related arenavirus species, weak or no cross-neutralization occurs. Two closely related clade B viruses, Machupo virus (MACV) and Junín virus (JUNV), have nearly identical overall GPC architecture and share a host receptor, transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Given structural and functional similarities of the GP1 receptor binding site (RBS) of these viruses and the recent demonstration that the RBS is an important target for neutralizing antibodies, it is not clear how these viruses avoid cross-neutralization. To address this, MACV/JUNV chimeric GPCs were assessed for interaction with a group of α-JUNV GPC monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and mouse antisera against JUNV or MACV GPC. All six MAbs targeted GP1, with those that neutralized JUNV GPC-pseudovirions competing with each other for RBS binding. However, these MAbs were unable to bind to a chimeric GPC composed of JUNV GP1 containing a small disulfide bonded loop (loop 10) unique to MACV GPC, suggesting that this loop may block MAbs interaction with the GP1 RBS. Consistent with this loop causing interference, mouse anti-JUNV GPC antisera that solely neutralized pseudovirions bearing autologous GP1 provided enhanced neutralization of MACV GPC when this loop was removed. Our studies provide evidence that loop 10, which is unique to MACV GP1, is an important impediment to binding of neutralizing antibodies and contributes to the poor cross-neutralization of α-JUNV antisera against MACV.IMPORTANCE Multiple New World arenaviruses can cause severe disease in humans, and some geographic overlap exists among these viruses. A vaccine that protects against a broad range of New World arenaviruses is desirable for purposes of simplicity, cost, and broad protection against multiple National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease-assigned category A priority pathogens. In this study, we sought to better understand how closely related arenaviruses elude cross-species neutralization by investigating the structural bases of antibody binding and avoidance. In our studies, we found that neutralizing antibodies against two New World arenaviruses, Machupo virus (MACV) and Junín virus (JUNV), bound to the envelope glycoprotein 1 (GP1) with JUNV monoclonal antibodies targeting the receptor binding site (RBS). We further show that altered structures surrounding the RBS pocket in MACV GP1 impede access of JUNV-elicited antibodies.

"Agouti-related protein (Agrp) encodes a hypothalamic neuropeptide that promotes positive energy balance by stimulating food intake and reducing energy expenditure. Agrp expression in the brain is restricted to neurons within the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and expression levels are elevated as a consequence of food deprivation. We tested a series of bacterial artificial chromosome reporter constructs with varying amounts of sequence flanking the Agrp transcription unit in transgenic mice to identify and refine a region of DNA capable of recapitulating characteristics of Agrp expression. We report that a 42.5-kb region upstream of Agrp, containing three distinct regions that are evolutionarily conserved between mouse and human, is necessary and sufficient to consistently drive reporter expression specifically within AgRP neurons in a fasting-responsive manner. In addition, we demonstrate that this region allows for the stable expression of Cre recombinase in transgenic mice, providing a genetic tool for studying anabolic neural circuits that control energy balance.

"Matrine, a quinolizidine alkaloid, is commonly employed for treating various viral and inflammatory disorders. Here, we have evaluated matrine for its activity on C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-9/2) expression, and its potential to affect tumor metastasis and invasion. The effects of matrine on CXCR4, MMP-9/2, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation in lung (A549), prostate (DU145), and pancreas (MIA PaCa-2) cells were investigated by diverse techniques. The expression level of CXCR4 and MMP-9/2 was analyzed by western blot analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. NF-κB activation was also evaluated by western blot analysis, electrophoretic mobility shift assay as well as immunocytochemical experiments. Furthermore, we monitored cell invasion and metastasis activities by wound healing and Boyden chamber assays. We noted that matrine induced a down-regulation of CXCR4 and MMP-9/2 at both protein and mRNA levels. In addition, matrine negatively regulated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 12 (CXCL12)-induced CXCR4 expression. Moreover, NF-κB suppression by matrine led to inhibition of metastatic potential of tumor cells. Our results suggest that matrine can block the cancer metastasis through the negative regulation of CXCR4 and MMP-9/2 and consequently it can be considered as a potential candidate for cancer therapy.

"The long pentraxin, pentraxin 3 (PTX3), can play beneficial or detrimental roles during infection and disease by modulating various aspects of the immune system. There is growing evidence to suggest that PTX3 can mediate antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies demonstrated that PTX3 and the short pentraxin serum amyloid P express sialic acids that are recognized by the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein of certain influenza A viruses (IAV), resulting in virus neutralization and anti-IAV activity. In this study, we demonstrate that specificity of both HA and the viral neuraminidase for particular sialic acid linkages determines the susceptibility of H1N1, H3N2, and H7N9 strains to the antiviral activities of PTX3 and serum amyloid P. Selection of H3N2 virus mutants resistant to PTX3 allowed for identification of amino acid residues in the vicinity of the receptor-binding pocket of HA that are critical determinants of sensitivity to PTX3; this was supported by sequence analysis of a range of H3N2 strains that were sensitive or resistant to PTX3. In a mouse model of infection, the enhanced virulence of PTX3-resistant mutants was associated with increased virus replication and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the airways, leading to pulmonary inflammation and lung injury. Together, these studies identify determinants in the viral HA that can be associated with sensitivity to the antiviral activities of PTX3 and highlight its importance in the control of IAV infection.

"Cerebellar Purkinje cells play an important role in cerebellar function; lesions of Purkinje cells result in the disruption of motor coordination and motor learning. Although selective gene delivery to Purkinje cells would be a powerful technique for the study of pathophysiology in the cerebellum, a method for such a delivery has not yet been established. Here we employed human immunodeficiency virus-derived lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein to transduce Purkinje cells and examined factors that critically affect the viral tropism for Purkinje cells. Viral vectors encoding GFP were generated using different protocols, and were then injected into the mouse cerebellum. At 7 days and 2 months post-transduction, the relative proportions of transduced Purkinje cells were determined. Lentiviral vectors harvested from a medium of pH 7.2 preferentially transduced Purkinje cells (about half of the transduced cells). In contrast, when the viral vector was harvested from medium of <or= pH 7.0, only 12-26% of transduced cells were identified as Purkinje cells and 68-77% as Bergmann glia. A similar decrease in the efficiency of transduction for Purkinje cells, depending on the pH of the medium at the viral harvest, was observed in dissociated cell cultures. These results indicate that lentivector tropism for Purkinje cells is extremely sensitive to pH: a subtle decrease in the pH of the medium at the harvest shifts viral tropism strikingly towards Bergmann glia.

"Endogenous retroviruses, non-retroviral RNA viruses and DNA viruses have been found in the mammalian genomes. The origin of Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the major cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma in humans, remains unclear since its discovery. Here we show that fragments homologous to HCV structural and non-structural (NS) proteins present in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and hare (Lepus europaeus) genomes replicate in bovine cell cultures. The HCV genomic homolog fragments were demonstrated by RT-PCR, PCR, mass spectrometry, and replication in bovine cell cultures by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and immunogold electron microscopy (IEM) using specific MAbs for HCV NS3, NS4A, and NS5 proteins. These findings may lead to novel research approaches on the HCV origin, genesis, evolution and diversity.

"Myxoma virus is a poxvirus naturally found in two American leporid (rabbit) species (Sylvilagus brasiliensis and Sylvilagus bachmani) in which it causes an innocuous localised cutaneous fibroma. However, in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) the same virus causes the lethal disseminated disease myxomatosis. The introduction of myxoma virus into the European rabbit population in Australia in 1950 initiated the best known example of what happens when a novel pathogen jumps into a completely naïve new mammalian host species. The short generation time of the rabbit and their vast numbers in Australia meant evolution could be studied in real time. The carefully documented emergence of attenuated strains of virus that were more effectively transmitted by the mosquito vector and the subsequent selection of rabbits with genetic resistance to myxomatosis is the paradigm for pathogen virulence and host-pathogen coevolution. This natural experiment was repeated with the release of a separate strain of myxoma virus in France in 1952. The subsequent spread of the virus throughout Europe and its coevolution with the rabbit essentially paralleled what occurred in Australia. Detailed molecular studies on myxoma virus have dissected the role of virulence genes in the pathogenesis of myxomatosis and when combined with genomic data and reverse genetics should in future enable the understanding of the molecular evolution of the virus as it adapted to its new host. This review describes the natural history and evolution of myxoma virus together with the molecular biology and experimental pathogenesis studies that are informing our understanding of evolution of emerging diseases.

"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Age-related obesity is associated with impaired hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) gene expression. We assessed whether overproduction of POMC in the hypothalamus ameliorates age-related obesity in rats. METHODS: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) encoding Pomc (rAAV-Pomc) or control vector was delivered bilaterally into the basomedial hypothalamus of aged obese rats with coordinates targeting the arcuate nucleus. Energy balance, glucose metabolism, brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and mRNA levels of hypothalamic neuropeptides and melanocortin receptors were assessed. RESULTS: Forty-two days after Pomc gene delivery, hypothalamic Pomc expression increased 12-fold while agouti-related protein and neuropeptide Y mRNA levels remained unchanged. Using a punch technique, we detected the highest Pomc RNA level in the arcuate nucleus. Pomc overexpression reduced food consumption from day 10 after vector injection, but this anorexic effect abated by day 30. In contrast, there was a steady decrease in body weight without apparent attenuation. Pomc gene delivery decreased visceral adiposity and induced uncoupling protein 1 in brown adipose tissue in aged rats. Serum NEFA and triglyceride levels were also diminished by rAAV-Pomc treatment. Improved glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity were observed on day 36 but not day 20 after Pomc gene delivery. The expression of hypothalamic melanocortin 3 and 4 receptor decreased by 17% and 25%, respectively in rAAV-Pomc rats. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates that targeted Pomc gene therapy in the hypothalamus reduces body weight and visceral adiposity, and improves glucose and fat metabolism in aged obese rats. Thus long-term activation of the central melanocortin system may be a viable strategy to combat age-related obesity and diabetes.

"Five cyanophyte species (Amorphonostoc punctiforme, Gloeocapsa turgidus, Sphaeronostoc coeruleum, Stratonostoc linckia f. spongiaeforme and Synechococcus cedrorum) were isolated and identified from sandy Egyptian soils. Polysaccharides extracted from these species showed a pronounced antiviral activity against Rabies and Herpes-1 viruses represented by the absence of the characteristic cytopathic effects of these viruses. It was found that 100 μg polysaccharide/ml induced 100% inhibition of the two viruses which, depending on the polysaccharide concentration. Both of Gloeocapsa turgidus and Synechococcus cedrorum showed higher antiviral activity against rabies virus than that against herpes-1 virus. Amorphonostoc punctiforme showed nil to weak antiviral activity against both viruses. It was suggested that polysaccharides of such species of cyanophyte react against human and animal viruses. So, it could be concluded that there is a need for further studies to explain the mode of action of these substances on the replication of different viral origins to know how one deals with cyanophyte polysaccharides as antiviral substances in the most suitable and effective manner.

"OBJECTIVE: To observe the morphological recovery of rabies virus strain SRV 9 after rejuvenation in suckling mice and to study its morphogenesis in BHK-21 cells. METHODS: The long freeze-preserved rabies virus strain SRV 9 was rejuvenated through intracerebral inoculation of sucking mice twice, followed by propagation in BHK-21 cells. After cell culture the virus was purified through sucrose gradient density ultracentrifugation. RESULTS: Electromicroscopy of the purified virus showed that effective recovery of viral shape was obtained after the rejuvenation with majority of viral particles having a typical bullet-like shape and intact spikes on viral membrane. The proportion of DI particles (with short triangle and irregular shapes) in rejuvenatd virus supernatant was significantly decreased compared to un-rejuvenated virus. Viral morphogenesis in cells showed that typical virus particles could form in intracytoplasm 24 hours p.i. and the number of matured viral particles in cytoplasm increased significantly as culture was prolonged from 24 hours to 96 hours p.i.. Furthermore, the rejuvenated virus was observed budding from vacuole membrane in different patterns. CONCLUSION: (1) The proportion of DI particles can be significantly decreased by rejuvenated through intracerebral inoculation of sucking mice.(2) The optimal harvest opportunity of SRV9 is after being 1-2 undiluted passaged. (3) This research provided more information about morphogenesis of rabies virus.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the leading cause of chronic hepatitis in humans. Several host molecules participate in HCV cell entry, but this process remains unclear. The complete unraveling of the HCV entry process is important to further understand viral pathogenesis and develop therapeutics. Human hepatitis A virus (HAV) cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1), CD365, also known as TIM-1, functions as a phospholipid receptor involved in cell entry of several enveloped viruses. Here, we studied the role of HAVCR1 in HCV infection. HAVCR1 antibody inhibited entry in a dose-dependent manner. HAVCR1 soluble constructs neutralized HCV, which did not require the HAVCR1 mucinlike region and was abrogated by a mutation of N to A at position 94 (N94A) in the Ig variable (IgV) domain phospholipid-binding pocket, indicating a direct interaction of the HAVCR1 IgV domain with HCV virions. However, knockout of HAVCR1 in Huh7 cells reduced but did not prevent HCV growth. Interestingly, the mouse HAVCR1 ortholog, also a phospholipid receptor, did not enhance infection and a soluble form failed to neutralize HCV, although replacement of the mouse IgV domain with the human HAVCR1 IgV domain restored the enhancement of HCV infection. Mutations in the cytoplasmic tail revealed that direct HAVCR1 signaling is not required to enhance HCV infection. Our data show that the phospholipid-binding function and other determinant(s) in the IgV domain of human HAVCR1 enhance HCV infection. Although the exact mechanism is not known, it is possible that HAVCR1 facilitates entry by stabilizing or enhancing attachment, leading to direct interactions with specific receptors, such as CD81.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis C virus (HCV) enters cells through a multifaceted process. We identified the human hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1 (HAVCR1), CD365, also known as TIM-1, as a facilitator of HCV entry. Antibody blocking and silencing or knockout of HAVCR1 in hepatoma cells reduced HCV entry. Our findings that the interaction of HAVCR1 with HCV early during infection enhances entry but is not required for infection support the hypothesis that HAVCR1 facilitates entry by stabilizing or enhancing virus binding to the cell surface membrane and allowing the correct virus-receptor positioning for interaction with the main HCV receptors. Furthermore, our data show that in addition to the phospholipid-binding function of HAVCR1, the enhancement of HCV infection involves other determinants in the IgV domain of HAVCR1. These findings expand the repertoire of molecules that HCV uses for cell entry, adding to the already complex mechanism of HCV infection and pathogenesis.

"A new recombinant virus which labeled the infected neurons in a Golgi stain-like fashion was developed. The virus was based on a replication-defective Sindbis virus and was designed to express green fluorescent protein with a palmitoylation signal (palGFP). When the virus was injected into the ventrobasal thalamic nuclei, many neurons were visualized with the fluorescence of palGFP in the injection site. The labeling was enhanced by immunocytochemical staining with an antibody to green fluorescent protein to show the entire configuration of the dendrites. Thalamocortical axons of the infected neurons were also intensely immunostained in the somatosensory cortex. In contrast to palGFP, when DsRed with the same palmitoylation signal (palDsRed) was introduced into neurons with the Sindbis virus, palDsRed neither visualized the infected neurons in a Golgi stain-like manner nor stained projecting axons in the cerebral cortex. The palDsRed appeared to be aggregated or accumulated in some organelles in the infected neurons. Anterograde labeling with palGFP Sindbis virus was very intense, not only in thalamocortical neurons but also in callosal, striatonigral, and nigrostriatal neurons. Occasionally there were retrogradely labeled neurons that showed Golgi stain-like images. These results indicate that palGFP Sindbis virus can be used as an excellent anterograde tracer in the central nervous system.

"AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the values of clinical signs and the rapid diagnostic test (RDT) in the diagnosis of influenza H1N1 new variant in the pediatric emergency room. METHOD: From 18 August to 1st December 2009, children admitted to the pediatric emergency department of CHU Nord (Marseille, France) and suspected of flu according to French guidelines, were tested for influenza using both an influenza RDT and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay specific for H1N1. From 3 November to 3 December, clinical signs were also noted (fever, headaches, myalgia-arthralgia, shivers, diarrhea). RESULTS: A total of 1122 children were tested: 367 children (32.1%) had a positive specific PCR. The RDT value was: sensitivity 65.2% [55.8-73.6], specificity 99.5% [98.1-100], positive predictive value (PPV) 97.5% [91.8-100], negative predictive value (NPV) 91.2% [90.3-91.5], positive likelihood ratio (LRP) 153.7 [53.5-452.9] and negative likelihood ratio (LRN) 0.393 [0.387-0.411]. Clinical data were available for 504 children (328 over 2 years of age). In children more than 2 years of age and in multivariate analysis, headaches were the only sign significantly associated with a positive PCR (aOR=2.53 [1.25-5.12]). Overall, headaches and/or myalgia-arthralgia were valuable indicators for clinical diagnosis of flu, with a 75.8% NPV. Among children with a positive PCR, diarrhea was more frequent in children under 2 years of age (OR=2.76 [1.19-6.40]). The sensitivity of the RDT improved (90.9% [85.2-94.6]) when flu signs were also present. CONCLUSION: Associating clinical signs and RDT for the diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) new variant in a pediatric emergency room improves selection of children requiring appropriate antiviral treatment.

"Species in the genera Bartonella and Rickettsia are vector-borne pathogens of humans and domestic animals. The natural reservoirs and enzootic transmission cycles of these bacteria are poorly known in South Carolina. Thirteen species of lice and fleas were collected from urban animals and screened for the presence of Bartonella and Rickettsia by PCR amplification using genus-specific primers. Bartonella henselae was present in cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) from Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana) and a novel genotype of Bartonella was detected in Orchopeas howardi from an eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis). We detected R. typhi and three novel genotypes Rickettsia in other species of fleas and lice. Rickettsia typhi, the causative agent of murine typhus, was detected in two pools of lice (Enderleinellus marmotae) from the woodchuck (Marmota monax). Cat fleas harbored one of two novel genotypes of Rickettsia. A third novel Rickettsia was detected in Orchopeas howardi from an eastern gray squirrel.

"The serologic testing algorithm for recent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion (STARHS) distinguishes between recent acquisition of HIV infection (seroconversion, on average, in the past 129 days) or long-standing infection. STARHS was offered to sexually transmitted disease clinic patients to estimate HIV incidence and determine correlates of recent infection from October 1998 through December 1999. Of the 5227 patients tested, 116 (2.1%) were HIV infected, and 28 had recent infections. The incidence was highest among homosexual men (5.3%/year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.6%-10.0%), those who had HIV-infected partners (8.6%/year; 95% CI, 2.9%-21.1%), and those who had gonorrhea (6.7%/year; 95% CI, 1.5%-20.3%). Among homosexual men, African American (odds ratio [OR], 3.61; 95% CI, 1.13-11.55) or Latino (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 1.11-8.55) race/ethnicity, and having unprotected anal intercourse (OR, 2.98; 95% CL, 1.20-7.45) or gonorrhea (OR, 3.03 95% CI, 1.07-8.63) predicted the predominance of a recent seroconversion. HIV infections in San Francisco may be shifting from white men who have sex with men to men of color who have sex with men.

"Platinum-based compounds are widely used and effective chemotherapeutic agents; however, sensory peripheral neuropathy is a dose-limiting and long term side effect for 20-30% of patients. A critical question is whether the mechanisms of cell death underlying clinical efficacy can be separated from the effects on neurons in order to develop strategies that prevent platinum-induced neuropathy. In rodent dorsal root ganglion neurons (DRG), cisplatin has been shown to bind and damage neuronal DNA, inducing apoptosis; however genetic manipulation in order to study mechanisms of this phenomenon in the rodent model system is costly and time-consuming. Drosophila melanogaster are commonly used to study neurological disorders, have DNA damage-apoptosis mechanisms homologous to mammalian systems, and have readily-available, inexpensive tools for rapid genetic manipulation. We therefore sought to develop adult Drosophila as a new model to study cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. Adult Drosophila were exposed to 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 μg/ml cisplatin for 3 days and observed for fly survival and geotactic climbing behavior, cisplatin-DNA binding and cellular apoptosis. On day 3, 50 μg/ml cisplatin reduced the number of flies able to climb above 2 cm to 43% while fly survival was maintained at 92%. 100% lethality was observed at 400 μg/ml cisplatin. Whole fly platinum-genomic DNA adducts were measured and found to be comparable to adduct levels previously measured in rat DRG neurons. Brain, ovaries, kidney and heart harvested from cisplatin treated flies were stained for active caspase 3. Apoptosis was found in ovaries and brain but not in heart and kidney. Brain apoptosis was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Expression of the anti-apoptotic baculoviral protein, p35, in neurons using the GAL4-UAS system prevented cisplatin-induced apoptosis in the brain and restored climbing behavior. In conclusion, cisplatin-induced behavioral and apoptotic changes in Drosophila resemble those seen in mammals. Furthermore, the use of lethality and climbing assays combined with powerful gene manipulation, make Drosophila a suitable model to study mechanisms of cisplatin neurotoxicity.

"To estimate rates and identify correlates of HIV disclosure in migrants from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) successfully treated, a sub-analysis was conducted in HIV-1 native SSA migrants, living in France with undetectable viral load on antiretroviral, included in the VIHVO adherence study. Logistic regression models assessed factors associated with HIV disclosure. Among 246 individuals (40 % male, median age 41), 79 % of those in a steady heterosexual partnership (n = 167) had disclosed their status to their partner, 55 % of the total 246 to a relative, and 33 % to (an)other person(s). Disclosure to one's steady partner was associated with a follow-up duration since HIV diagnosis of more than 5 years, a higher literacy level, a better social context and marital status. Women were more likely to disclose their HIV status to relatives. Interventions targeting this population should be provided to improve disclosure which in turn ensures better social support, testing of the partner and lower rates of undiagnosed HIV.

"INTRODUCTION: The transfer of drug-susceptible (suicide) genes to tumor cells by retroviral or adenoviral vectors is a novel approach to the treatment of human tumors. AIMS: To ascertain the antitumor effect of retroviral transduction of the pancreatic cancer cell lines MIA PaCa 2, CAPAN-1, PANC1, and PSN1 with the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene. METHODOLOGY: The vector carried a neoselectable marker gene, the human interleukin-2 gene, an internal ribosome entry coding site, and the region coding HSV-TK. RESULTS: Twenty micromoles or less of ganciclovir did not modify nontransduced TK- cell growth, whereas > or =100 micromol completely inhibited TK- cell growth, indicating that this dosage is cytotoxic per se. The 4 TK- and the 4 transduced cell lines were treated daily with 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 20 micromol of ganciclovir for 13 days. CAPAN-1 cell growth was completely inhibited by 0.1 micromol of ganciclovir; higher doses were required to kill PANC1 (10 micromol) and PSN1 (20 micromol). MIA PaCa 2 cell growth decreased following a 20-micromol ganciclovir dosing. The bystander effect was great in the CAPAN-1 cell line and moderate in PANC1; no bystander effect was recorded in MIA PaCa 2 and PSN1 cell lines. CONCLUSION: Gene therapy with HSV-TK for pancreatic cancer seems effective in only a limited number of tumor-derived cell lines, and this limits its application in vivo.

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a significant viral disease caused by infection with Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). The first documented cases of RHDV in Singapore occurred in adult pet European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in September 2020. Rabbits presented with acute hyporexia, lethargy, huddled posture, and varying degrees of pyrexia and tachypnoea. Clinical pathology consistently reflected markedly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALKP). Hepatic lobe torsion was ruled out using ultrasonography and colour Doppler studies in all patients. A total of 11 rabbits owned by 3 families were presented to the clinics; 8/11 rabbits died within 48 hr of presentation, while the remaining two rabbits had recovered after prolonged hospitalization and one rabbit was aclinical. Histopathology revealed acute, marked diffuse hepatocellular necrosis and degeneration, findings which were suggestive for RHDV infection and prompted the undertaking of further molecular diagnostics. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction of the liver samples detected RHDV RNA. Molecular characterization of viral genomes by whole genome sequencing revealed that the outbreak strain was of the genotype GI.2 (RHDV2/RHDVb). Nucleotide sequences of the VP60 gene were compared with various RHDV variants using phylogenetic analysis. The sample genome shared highest sequence identity with a GI.2-genotyped virus from GenBank (RHDV isolate Algarve 1 polyprotein and minor structural protein (VP10) genes, GenBank accession KF442961). The combination of clinical, histopathological, molecular and sequencing technologies enabled rapid detection and detailed genetic characterization of the RHDV virus causing the present outbreak for prompt implementation of disease control measures in Singapore. Further epidemiological investigations of potential virus introduction into Singapore are ongoing.

"Retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (rWAT) and subcutaneous (inguinal) white adipose tissue (iWAT) are both innervated and regulated by sympathetic efferents, but the distribution and identity of the cells in the brain that regulate sympathetic outflow are poorly characterized. Our aim was to use two isogenic strains of a neurotropic virus (pseudorabies, Bartha) tagged with either green or red fluorescent reporters to identify cells in the brain that project to rWAT and/or iWAT. These viruses were injected into separate WAT depots in male and female Sprague Dawley rats. Retrogradely labeled neurons in the CNS were characterized by immunohistochemistry and PCR. For the latter, laser capture of individual virally labeled neurons was used. All virally labeled brain regions contained neurons projecting to either and both WAT depots. Neurons to abdominal fat were the most abundant in males, whereas females contained a greater proportion of neurons to subcutaneous via private lines and collateral branches. Retrogradely labeled neurons directed to WAT expressed estrogen receptor-α (ERα), and fewer neurons to subcutaneous WAT expressed ERα in males. Regardless of sex, projections from the arcuate nucleus were predominantly from pro-opiomelanocortin cells, with a notable lack of projections from agouti-related protein-expressing neurons. Within the lateral hypothalamus, neurons directed to rWAT and iWAT expressed orexin and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), but male rats had a predominance of MCH directed to iWAT. In conclusion, the neurochemical substrates that project through polysynaptic pathways to iWAT and rWAT are different in male and female rats, suggesting that metabolic regulation of rWAT and iWAT is sexually dimorphic.

"The first isolation of a Hantaan-related virus from a feral rat in the United States was made from a Rattus norvegicus caught in New Orleans. The strain, designated Tchoupitoulas virus, is antigenically related to, but distinct from, the prototype strain 76-118 of Hantaan virus and is the first Hantaan-like virus isolated from the pancreas of a naturally infected animal. Serosurveys of wild rodents from urban and rural areas in the United States indicated that Hantaan-related viruses infected urban rats in coastal and inland cities and infected five species of New World rodents in the western United States (Peromyscus maniculatus, Peromyscus difficilis, Peromyscus californicus, Neotoma mexicana, and Neotoma cinerea). Serosurveys disclosed no evidence of Hantaan-virus infection in rats in large-scale breeding colonies.

"Ultrafiltration through hollow fibrous filters followed by purification in interrupted and linear urografin gradients yielded a Lassa virus suspension of high concentration. The use of gamma-irradiation for inactivation of the frozen virus suspension (-70 degrees C) caused no apparent structural changes of virions and made it possible to examine Lassa virus in electron microscope by negative staining. The observed virus particles in their morphology and sizes did not differ from previously described particles of other members of the Arenaviridae family. In ultrathin sections of Lassa virus-infected Vero cells, atypical virions were sometimes visible alongside with typical particles. Within one type of such particles no ribosome-like granules could be detected. Such ""hollow"" particles may possibly be defective virions. Another kind of atypical particles contained homogeneous electron-dense core and resembled mycoplasma. Of greatest interest are the particles with heterogeneous core in which ""sandy"" granules can be distinguished. The presence of greater amounts of uranophilic material than usually may be explained by getting into the virion in the process of its formation of a greater amount of genetic material than that present in typical virions.

"Apolipoprotein M (apoM) is a plasma apolipoprotein that mainly associates with high-density lipoproteins. Hence, most studies on apoM so far have investigated its effect on and association with lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis. The insight into apoM biology recently took a major turn. ApoM was identified as a carrier of the bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). S1P activates five different G-protein-coupled receptors, known as the S1P-receptors 1-5 and, hence, affects a wide range of biological processes, such as lymphocyte trafficking, angiogenesis, wound repair and even virus suppression and cancer. The ability of apoM to bind S1P is due to a lipophilic binding pocket within the lipocalin structure of the apoM molecule. Mice overexpressing apoM have increased plasma S1P concentrations, whereas apoM-deficient mice have decreased S1P levels. ApoM-S1P is able to activate the S1P-receptor-1, affecting the function of endothelial cells, and apoM-deficient mice display impaired endothelial permeability in the lung. This review will focus on the putative biological roles of the new apoM-S1P axis in relation to lipoprotein metabolism, lipid disorders and atherosclerosis.

"BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever (RVF)-like disease was first reported in Tanzania more than eight decades ago and the last large outbreak of the disease occurred in 2006-07. This study investigates the spatial and temporal pattern of RVF outbreaks in Tanzania over the past 80 years in order to guide prevention and control strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out based on disease reporting data from Tanzania at district or village level. The data were sourced from the Ministries responsible for livestock and human health, Tanzania Meteorological Agency and research institutions involved in RVF surveillance and diagnosis. The spatial distribution of outbreaks was mapped using ArcGIS 10. The space-time permutation model was applied to identify clusters of cases, and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors associated with the occurrence of outbreaks in the district. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: RVF outbreaks were reported between December and June in 1930, 1947, 1957, 1960, 1963, 1968, 1977-79, 1989, 1997-98 and 2006-07 in 39.2% of the districts in Tanzania. There was statistically significant spatio-temporal clustering of outbreaks. RVF occurrence was associated with the eastern Rift Valley ecosystem (OR = 6.14, CI: 1.96, 19.28), total amount of rainfall of >405.4 mm (OR = 12.36, CI: 3.06, 49.88), soil texture (clay [OR = 8.76, CI: 2.52, 30.50], and loam [OR = 8.79, CI: 2.04, 37.82]). CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: RVF outbreaks were found to be distributed heterogeneously and transmission dynamics appeared to vary between areas. The sequence of outbreak waves, continuously cover more parts of the country. Whenever infection has been introduced into an area, it is likely to be involved in future outbreaks. The cases were more likely to be reported from the eastern Rift Valley than from the western Rift Valley ecosystem and from areas with clay and loam rather than sandy soil texture.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry is dependent on CD81. To investigate whether the CD81 sequence is a determinant of HCV host range, we expressed a panel of diverse CD81 proteins and tested their ability to interact with HCV. CD81 large extracellular loop (LEL) sequences were expressed as recombinant proteins; the human and, to a low level, the African green monkey sequences bound soluble HCV E2 (sE2) and inhibited infection by retrovirus pseudotype particles bearing HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp). In contrast, mouse or rat CD81 proteins failed to bind sE2 or to inhibit HCVpp infection. However, CD81 proteins from all species, when expressed in HepG2 cells, conferred susceptibility to infection by HCVpp and cell culture-grown HCV to various levels, with the rat sequence being the least efficient. Recombinant human CD81 LEL inhibited HCVpp infectivity only if present during the virus-cell incubation, consistent with a role for CD81 after virus attachment. Amino acid changes that abrogate sE2 binding (I182F, N184Y, and F186S, alone or in combination) were introduced into human CD81. All three amino acid changes in human CD81 resulted in a molecule that still supported HCVpp infection, albeit with reduced efficiency. In summary, there is a remarkable plasticity in the range of CD81 sequences that can support HCV entry, suggesting that CD81 polymorphism may contribute to, but alone does not define, the HCV susceptibility of a species. In addition, the capacity to support viral entry is only partially reflected by assays measuring sE2 interaction with recombinant or full-length CD81 proteins.

"Cutaneous epitheliotropic T-cell lymphoma with liver metastasis was diagnosed in a 10-year-old eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus). Physical findings included intracutaneous swellings, ulcerated plaques and nodules, hypotrichosis and erythema of the skin. Fine needle aspiration from the skin lesions showed a population of large lymphocytes and lymphoblasts, and was helpful in establishing the diagnosis antemortem. The post-mortem examination revealed epitheliotropic lymphoma with liver metastasis. Immunohistochemistry proved the T-cell origin both in the liver and skin tumours. Electron microscopy did not reveal any viral particles within the tumour. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of lymphoma described in this species.

"Setting: Manicaland Province, Zimbabwe. Objectives: To compare the utilisation and results of deploying Xpert(®) MTB/RIF in 13 (one provincial, six district and six rural) hospitals between January and June 2016, when Xpert was recommended only for those with presumptive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and between January and June 2017, when Xpert was recommended for all presumptive TB patients. Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Results: Xpert assays averaged 759 monthly in 2016 and 1430 monthly in 2017 (88% increase). Utilisation of Xpert averaged 22% monthly in 2016 and 42% in 2017 (88% increase). In 2017, utilisation of Xpert was significantly higher in provincial (82%) than in district (51%) and rural (26%) hospitals (P < 0.001). The proportion of successful assays that detected TB decreased significantly from 13% in 2016 to 7% in 2017 (a 46% decrease, P < 0.001); this phenomenon was observed in all types of hospital. The proportion of persons detected with rifampicin-resistant TB was similar between hospitals (4% in 2016 and 3% in 2017). The proportion of registered TB cases with bacteriological confirmation increased from 48% in 2016 to 53% in 2017 (P = 0.04). Conclusion: Xpert use in all presumptive TB patients led to a significant increase in assay numbers and utilisation of Xpert instruments, resulting in more bacteriological confirmation of cases.

"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), carried and spread by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), causes a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) called nephropathia epidemica (NE). Acute high fever, acute kidney injury (AKI), thrombocytopenia, and hematuria are typical features of this syndrome. In addition, headache, blurred vision, insomnia, vertigo, and nausea are commonly associated with the disease. This review explores the mechanisms and presentations of ocular and central nervous system involvement in acute NE.

"Identification and characterization of a metal ion binding site in an RNA pseudoknot was accomplished using cobalt (III) hexammine, Co(NH3)63+, as a probe for magnesium (II) hexahydrate, Mg(H2O)62+, in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural studies. The pseudoknot causes efficient -1 ribosomal frameshifting in mouse mammary tumor virus. Divalent metal ions, such as Mg2+, are critical for RNA structure and function; Mg2+preferentially stabilizes the pseudoknot relative to its constituent hairpins. The use of Co(NH3)63+as a substitute for Mg2+was investigated by ultraviolet absorbance melting curves, NMR titrations of the imino protons, and analysis of NMR spectra in the presence of Mg2+or Co (NH3)63+. The structure of the pseudoknot-Co(NH3)63+complex reveals an ion-binding pocket formed by a short, two-nucleotide loop and the major groove of a stem. Co(NH3)63+stabilizes the sharp loop-to-stem turn and reduces the electrostatic repulsion of the phosphates in three proximal strands. Hydrogen bonds are identified between the Co(NH3)63+protons and non-bridging phosphate oxygen atoms, 2' hydroxyl groups, and nitrogen and oxygen acceptors on the bases. The binding site is significantly different from that previously characterized in the major groove surface of tandem G.U base-pairs, but is similar to those observed in crystal structures of a fragment of the 5 S rRNA and the P5c helix of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron. Changes in chemical shifts occurred at the same pseudoknot protons on addition of Mg2+as on addition of Co(NH3)63+, indicating that both ions bind at the same site. Ion binding dissociation constants of approximately 0.6 mM and 5 mM (in 200 mM Na+and a temperature of 15 degrees C) were obtained for Co(NH3)63+and Mg2+, respectively, from the change in chemical shift as a function of metal ion concentration. An extensive array of non-sequence-specific hydrogen bond acceptors coupled with conserved structural elements within the binding pocket suggest a general mode of divalent metal ion stabilization of this type of frameshifter pseudoknot. These results provide new thermodynamic and structural insights into the role divalent metal ions play in stabilizing RNA tertiary structural motifs such as pseudoknots.

"Zoonoses are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. More than 250 distinct zoonoses have been described in the literature. It is estimated that 56% of United States households contain at least one pet, and although considerable research has been performed regarding the more common household animals including dogs, cats, small birds, and rodents, surprisingly little is known about the zoonotic hazards of owning the more exotic pets. According to the 1997 USPHS/IDSA Report on the Prevention of Opportunistic Infections in Persons Infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus, the immunocompromised patient should avoid contact with feces-laden soil, litter boxes, reptiles, most pet birds, and any animal less than 6 months old . It has also been documented that because of their inquisitive nature, children are at even higher risk for infection from animals than adolescents or immunocompetent adults. In this article the authors have reviewed the available data regarding hazards associated with the hedgehog, flying squirrel, iguana, chinchilla, and cockatoo. With the growing popularity of such exotic pets, further observation and research is warranted. Physicians need to be aware of the possibility of zoonotic disease related to exotic pet ownership, and they should address this issue when obtaining a history and formulating a differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions suggestive of such illnesses.

"OBJECTIVES: Despite the fact that a considerable portion of hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive individuals are viraemic, the risk of transmitting HCV to others is context dependent. Prison is a particularly risky environment as HCV prevention tools are often unavailable. Using data from a cross-sectional study conducted in centres for HCV testing in southeastern France, we aimed to compare the patterns of risk factors in HCV-positive inmates with those in the general population. SETTING: 26 centres for HIV/HCV testing in southeastern France (23 in the general population and 3 in prison). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: HCV seropositivity measured with ELISA test. METHODS: A propensity score method to ensure that the general and inmate populations could be compared and a multimodel averaging to estimate the degree (strong, weak, none) of the association of a number of specific factors with HCV seropositivity in each group. RESULTS: Among the 52,082 participants, HCV infection prevalence was 1.5% and 5.2% in the general (n=46,125) and inmate (n=5957) populations, respectively. In both populations, 'drug injection without snorting' and 'drug injection with snorting' were very strongly associated with HCV seropositivity. Among inmates, 'drug snorting alone' (OR (95% CI) 2.21 (1.39 to 3.52) was also a strong correlate while tattoos, piercings (OR (95% CI) 1.22 (0.92 to 1.61)) and the sharing of toiletry items (OR (95% CI) 1.44 (0.84 to 2.47)) were weak correlates. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of risk factors associated with HCV seropositivity is different between the general and prison populations, injection and snorting practices being more prevalent in the latter. Access to prevention measures in prisons is not only a public health issue but also a human right for inmates who deserve equity of care and prevention.

"This study evaluated the safety of and humoral response to the Merial Recombitek(®) recombinant canine distemper virus (rCDV) vaccine in maned wolves (n = 9, age 2-9 yr). All maned wolves had prior history of annual vaccination with the Merial Purevax(®) ferret rCDV vaccine. Serum neutralization (SN) to CDV was measured prior to initial vaccination with the rCDV Recombitek vaccine followed by a booster vaccination at 4-6 wk. Final SN titers were obtained at 13 wk post initial vaccination. The maned wolves developed no observable adverse side effects through the study. Pre-Recombitek vaccination SN titers ranged from negative to 1: 8. Postvaccination CDV titers ranged from negative to 1: 8, and were therefore below the range of that considered protective in domestic dogs.

"Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an IL-1-like ligand for the ST2 receptor that stimulates the production of Th2-associated cytokines. Recently, we showed that IL-33 is a chromatin-associated factor in the nucleus of endothelial cells in vivo. Here, we report the identification of a short IL-33 chromatin-binding peptide that shares striking similarities with a motif found in Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus LANA (latency-associated nuclear antigen), which is responsible for the attachment of viral genomes to mitotic chromosomes. Similar to LANA, the IL-33 peptide docks into the acidic pocket formed by the H2A-H2B dimer at the nucleosomal surface and regulates chromatin compaction by promoting nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Taken together, our data provide important new insights into the nuclear roles of IL-33, and show a unique example of molecular mimicry of a chromatin-associated cytokine by a DNA tumour virus. In addition, the data provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of the existence of non-histone cellular factors that bind to the acidic pocket of the nucleosome.

"An isothermal batch experiment was conducted in the laboratory to compare adsorption of bacteriophages MS2 and phiX174 onto 6 different soils (red loam soil, red clay soil, wushan soil, huangni soil, sandy fluvo-aquic soil and loamy fluvo-aquic soil) in China. Soils with sterilized or non-sterilized treatment were used. Relative coefficients of each numerical simulation of the isotherms using three models were evaluated. The results show that the properties of the soil and virus, and presence/absence of the soil autochthonous microorganisms have pronounced effect on the virus adsorption. Both MS2 and phiX174 are almost completely adsorbed by the red clay soil, but minimal adsorption is observed in the two fluvo-aquic soils. Adsorption of phiX174 to all the non-sterilized soils is generally much greater than that of MS2, while sterilization leads to opposite results. Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms are found to have better coefficients to simulate the apparent steady-state virus concentrations. Freundlich isotherm is capable of demonstrating the effect of virus concentration on adsorption behavior. Langmuir isotherms can be used to compare relative adsorption among treatments, while the present study suggests that maximum adsorption can not be calculated when using the Langmuir isotherms.

"INTRODUCTION: Though Senegal has one of the highest estimated prevalence rates of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection worldwide, epidemiological data in the general population are lacking and consequences of the infection remain undocumented. The ANRS-12356 AmBASS study aims at evaluating the health and socioeconomic burden of chronic HBV infection at the individual, household and population level. Its specific objectives are (1) to document the epidemiology of chronic HBV infection, including prevalence and risk factors; (2) to assess the acceptability of home-based testing and first clinic visit; (3) to investigate the repercussions of chronic HBV infection on living conditions; and (4) to estimate the public health impact of chronic HBV infection at the population level and the feasibility of a decentralised model of HBV test and treat. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This multidisciplinary cross-sectional survey includes a twofold data collection: (1) home-based screening using dried blood spot (DBS) sampling and collection of sociodemographic, economic and behavioural data, and (2) additional clinical and biological data collection in chronic HBV carriers at the first clinic visit. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection will be estimated in the general population and in key subgroups. Risk factors for HBV acquisition in children will be explored using case-control analysis. HBV burden will be assessed through comparisons of health and economic outcomes between households affected by the disease versus non-affected households. Last, an economic evaluation will assess costs and health benefits of scaling-up HBV care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Senegalese National Ethical Committee for Research in Health, and received authorisation from the Senegalese Ministry of Health and the French Commission on Information Technology and Liberties (Senegalese Protocol Number: SEN17/15). The study results will be presented in peer-review journals, international conferences and at a workshop with national stakeholders in order to contribute to the design of programmes to address the HBV pandemic. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03215732; Pre-results.

"Cell culture based live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) as an alternative to egg-based LAIV have been explored because of lack of easy access to SPF eggs for large scale production. In this study, feasibility of MDCK platform was assessed by including multiple LAIV strains covering both type A (H1 and H3) and type B seasonal strains as well as the candidate pandemic potential strains like A/H5 and A/H7 for the growth in MDCK cells. A risk assessment study was conducted on the cell banks to evaluate safety concerns related to tumorigenicity with a regulatory perspective. Tumorigenic potential of the MDCK cells was evaluated in nude mice (10(7)cells/mouse) model system. The 50% tumor producing dose (TPD(50)) of MDCK cells was studied in SCID mice to determine the amount of cells required for induction of tumors. Further, we conducted an oncogenicity study in three sensitive rodent species as per the requirements specified in the WHO guidelines. We determined TPD(50) value of 1.9 X 10(4) cells/mice through subcutaneous route. Our results suggest that, the intranasal route of administration of the cell culture based LAIV pose minimal to no risk of tumorigenicity associated with the host cells. Also, non-oncogenic nature of MDCK cells was demonstrated. Host cell DNA in the vaccine formulations was < 10 ng/dose which ensures vaccine safety. Production efficiency and consistency were characterized and the observed titer values of the viral harvest and the processed bulk were comparable to the expansion in embryonated eggs. The present study clearly establishes the suitability of MDCK cells as a substrate for the manufacture of a safe and viable LAIV.

"Sanded nuclei are nuclei with eosinophilic inclusions identified by light microscopy in cases of chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, these inclusions have an almost homogeneous, finely granular texture giving a sandy appearance. They have been related to excess hepatitis B core antigen formation. We have studied liver biopsies from two HBsAg positive immunosuppressed patients with numerous sanded nuclei, morphologically identical to those previously described in hepatitis B. Immunohistochemically, sanded nuclei showed a strong nuclear positivity for delta antigen, but were negative for hepatitis B core antigen. Hepatitis B core particles were not demonstrable by electron microscopy. To our knowledge, this is the first time that sanded nuclei have been related to hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection.

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. Non-pathogenic spread of RHDV leading to persistent infection which later reactivated has recently been proposed as the cause of overt disease and death of a pet rabbit in Canada, the first confirmed case of Rabbit haemorrhagic disease in that country. We suggest that there is little evidence to support non-pathogenic spread of virulent RHDV, some evidence that is contradictory, and evidence to support a simpler alternative hypothesis. RHDV can be spread over long distances between sparse rabbit populations by fomites or flying insects. Although highly pathogenic, RHDV can be limited in its spread within rabbit populations, or its presence masked by closely related but non-pathogenic lagoviruses which can provide protection against acute disease. In the absence of any evidence from clinical studies to support reactivation of persistent RHDV infection, the simpler explanation seems more likely to be correct.

"The t(1;19) chromosomal translocation of pediatric pre-B cell leukemia produces chimeric oncoprotein E2a-Pbx1, which contains the N-terminal transactivation domain of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, E2a, joined to the majority of the homeodomain protein, Pbx1. There are three Pbx family members, which bind DNA as heterodimers with both broadly expressed Meis/Prep1 homeo-domain proteins and specifically expressed Hox homeodomain proteins. These Pbx heterodimers can augment the function of transcriptional activators bound to adjacent elements. In heterodimers, a conserved tryptophan motif in Hox proteins binds a pocket on the surface of the Pbx homeodomain, while Meis/Prep1 proteins bind an N-terminal Pbx domain, raising the possibility that the tryptophan-interaction pocket of the Pbx component of a Pbx-Meis/Prep1 complex is still available to bind trypto-phan motifs of other transcription factors bound to flanking elements. Here, we report that Pbx-Meis1/Prep1 binds DNA cooperatively with heterodimers of E2a and MyoD, myogenin, Mrf-4 or Myf-5. As with Hox proteins, a highly conserved tryptophan motif N-terminal to the DNA-binding domains of each myogenic bHLH family protein is required for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx-Meis1/Prep1. In vivo, MyoD requires this tryptophan motif to evoke chromatin remodeling in the Myogenin promoter and to activate Myogenin transcription. Pbx-Meis/Prep1 complexes, therefore, have the potential to cooperate with the myogenic bHLH proteins in regulating gene transcription.

"We previously used gel shift assays, Southwestern blots, and UV cross-linking to identify four proteins that bind to the 203-bp 5'-flanking region (-194/ +9) of the rabbit uteroglobin gene. Here we report cloning, by recognition site screening, the cDNAs for two of the uteroglobin promoter-binding proteins (95 kDa and 113 kDa). Their presumptive nucleotide-binding motifs share 61% identity with the SWI2/SNF2 helicase superfamily, and each protein has the novel C3HC4 (RING) zinc-finger signature near its C terminus. RUSH-1 alpha, the 113-kDa protein, is the rabbit homolog of human HIP116, a protein that binds to the human immunodeficiency virus-1 promoter. RUSH-1 beta is a 95-kDa truncated version of RUSH-1 alpha that results from alternative splicing of a 57-bp exon as confirmed by genomic cloning. Northern analysis showed mRNA expression (5.2 kb) was induced by progesterone +/- PRL and antagonized by estrogen. However, because the two proteins result from alternative splicing of a 57-bp exon, the small difference in their mRNA sizes could not be detected by Northern analysis. Therefore, competitive RT-PCR and HPLC were used to quantify differences in the ratios of their mRNAs. Progesterone +/- PRL treatment increased (P < 0.005) the ratio of message for RUSH-1 alpha compared with RUSH-1 beta. Western analysis showed the RUSH-1 alpha protein is increased in response to progesterone +/- PRL and decreased in response to estrogen. The antiserum used for immunoblotting specifically supershifts uteroglobin promoter-protein complexes in gel shift experiments. Because RUSH-1 alpha and beta messages were detected in lung, liver, and HRE-H9 cells, these proteins may regulate genes in numerous cell types.

"The replication of Sindbis virus (SIN) profoundly affects the metabolism of infected vertebrate cells. One of the main events during SIN infection is the strong inhibition of translation of cellular mRNAs. In this study, we used a combination of approaches, including the study of SIN replication in PKR(-/-) mouse embryo fibroblasts or in the presence of an excess of catalytically inactive PKR. We show that the PKR-dependent inhibition of translation is not the only and most likely not the major pathway mediating translational shutoff during SIN infection. The PKR-independent mechanism strongly affects the translation of cellular templates, whereas translation of SIN subgenomic RNA is resistant to inhibition, and this leads to a benefit for viral replication. Our findings suggest that both PKR-dependent and non-PKR-dependent mechanisms of SIN-induced translational shutoff can be manipulated by using SIN replicons expressing mutated SIN nsP2 or kinase-defective PKR. Specifically, we show that expression of heterologous genes from SIN-based and most likely other alphavirus-based replicons can be increased by downregulating both the PKR-dependent and PKR-independent translational shutoffs.

"Retroviral vectors have served as efficient gene delivery tools in various biotechnology fields. However, viral DNA is randomly inserted into the genome, which can cause problems, such as insertional mutagenesis and gene silencing. Previously, we reported a site-specific gene integration system, in which a transgene is integrated into a predetermined chromosomal locus of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using integrase-defective retroviral vectors (IDRVs) and Cre recombinase. In this system, a Cre expression plasmid is transfected into founder cells before retroviral transduction. In practical applications of site-specific gene modification such as for hard-to-transfect cells or for in vivo gene delivery, both the transgene and the Cre protein into retroviral virions should be encapsulate. Here, we generated novel hybrid IDRVs in which viral genome and enzymatically active Cre can be delivered (Cre-IDRVs). Cre-IDRVs encoding marker genes, neomycin resistance and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), flanked by wild-type and mutated loxP sites were produced using an expression plasmid for a chimeric protein of Cre and retroviral gag-pol. After analyzing the incorporation of the Cre protein into retroviral virions by Western blotting, the Cre-IDRV was infected into founder CHO cells, in which marker genes (hygromycin resistance and red fluorescent protein) flanked with corresponding loxP sites are introduced into the genome. G418-resistant colonies expressing GFP appeared and the site-specific integration of the transgene into the expected chromosomal site was confirmed by PCR and sequencing of amplicons. Moreover, when Cre-IDRV carried a gene expression unit for a recombinant antibody, the recombinant cells in which the antibody expression cassette was integrated in a site-specific manner were generated and the cells produced the recombinant antibody. This method may provide a promising tool to perform site-specific gene modification according to Cre-based cell engineering. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2016;113: 1600-1610. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"Alphaviruses productively infect a variety of vertebrate and insect cell lines. In vertebrate cells, Sindbis virus redirects cellular processes to meet the needs of virus propagation. At the same time, cells respond to virus replication by downregulating virus growth and preventing dissemination of the infection. The balance between these two mechanisms determines the outcome of infection at the cellular and organismal levels. In this report, we demonstrate that a viral nonstructural protein, nsP2, is a significant regulator of Sindbis virus-host cell interactions. This protein not only is a component of the replicative enzyme complex required for replication and transcription of viral RNAs but also plays a role in suppressing the antiviral response in Sindbis virus-infected cells. nsP2 most likely acts by decreasing interferon (IFN) production and minimizing virus visibility. Infection of murine cells with Sindbis virus expressing a mutant nsP2 leads to higher levels of IFN secretion and the activation of 170 cellular genes that are induced by IFN and/or virus replication. Secreted IFN protects naive cells against Sindbis virus infection and also stops viral replication in productively infected cells. Mutations in nsP2 can also attenuate Sindbis virus cytopathogenicity. Such mutants can persist in mammalian cells with defects in the alpha/beta IFN (IFN-alpha/beta) system or when IFN activity is neutralized by anti-IFN-alpha/beta antibodies. These findings provide new insight into the alphavirus-host cell interaction and have implications for the development of improved alphavirus expression systems with better antigen-presenting potential.

"Groundwater contamination and transport of viruses and bacteria in aquifers are a major concern worldwide. To ascertain the ability of these aquifers to remove pathogens, tracer tests with microbial surrogates are carried out. These tests are laborious and may require special permits, and therefore, column tests are often done instead. Unfortunately, results from column tests tend to grossly overestimate removal rates when compared to the field scale, which can lead to an underestimation of groundwater contamination risks. Scale is an important consideration when examining pathogen transport through porous media, as pathogen removal is rarely a linear process. In this study, field tests were carried out with endospores of Bacillus subtilis and coliphage phiX174 over a distance of 25 m in an alluvial gravel aquifer near Vienna, Austria. The sandy gravel material from the field site was also used in column tests with the same tracers. Both attachment-detachment and colloid filtration theory were used to model these tests, as well as log-removal rates per meter. The results show that the spatial removal rate (log/m) is approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher on the column scale, when compared to the field. A comparison with the literature showed a correlation between the heterogeneity of the porous media and the difference in removal rates between the column and field scale.

"We monitored the development of hepatocellular carcinoma due to chronic infection with woodchuck hepatitis virus by using monthly serum samples, physical examination, and magnetic resonance imaging. The same woodchucks can be imaged repeatedly over a 1-y period by allowing the animals to recover after each experiment, thus reducing the number of animals required without compromising the quality of the data obtained. Age- and sex-matched uninfected control (n = 5) and chronically infected (n = 5) woodchucks were group-housed according to sex and infection status. Woodchucks were anaesthetized using an inhalation anesthetic (isoflurane) without premedication. During imaging, we regularly monitored heart rate, body temperature, and respiration. Tumor growth was observed using MRI, whereas the extent of hepatocyte injury was followed using serum liver enzymes. Elevated serum gamma glutamyltransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels indicated hepatocyte injury due to tumor growth. On magnetic resonance images, the liver should appear as a well-defined, homogenous organ with defined regions of hyperintensities from larger blood vessels. Within tumor nodules, the liver appeared irregularly shaped, having heterogeneous intensity from unregulated cellular proliferation. Changes in tumor size can be monitored by imaging infected woodchucks on a regular basis. Using the imaging techniques we describe, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma can be visualized using magnetic resonance imaging, correlated to serum tests, and compared with the results from uninfected control woodchucks, thereby improving the understanding of the disease progress.

"INTRODUCTION: The high prevalence of hepatitis C and the persistence of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) risk practices in people who inject drugs (PWID) in France underlines the need for innovative prevention interventions. The main objective of this article is to describe the design of the COSINUS cohort study and outline the issues it will explore to evaluate the impact of drug consumption rooms (DCR) on PWID outcomes. Secondary objectives are to assess how DCR (a) influence other drug-related practices, such as the transition from intravenous to less risky modes of use, (b) reduce drug use frequency/quantity, (c) increase access to treatment for addiction and comorbidities (infectious, psychiatric and other), (d) improve social conditions and (e) reduce levels of violence experienced and drug-related offences. COSINUS will also give us the opportunity to investigate the impact of other harm reduction tools in France and their combined effect with DCR on reducing HIV-HCV risk practices. Furthermore, we will be better able to identify PWID needs. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Enrollment in this prospective multi-site cohort study started in June 2016. Overall, 680 PWID in four different cities (Bordeaux, Marseilles, Paris and Strasbourg) will be enrolled and followed up for 12 months through face-to-face structured interviews administered by trained staff to all eligible participants at baseline (M0), 3 month (M3), 6 month (M6) and 12 month (M12) follow-up visits. These interviews gather data on socio-demographic characteristics, past and current drug and alcohol consumption, drug-use related practices, access to care and social services, experience of violence (as victims), offences, other psychosocial issues and perception and needs about harm reduction interventions and services. Longitudinal data analysis will use a mixed logistic model to assess the impact of individual and structural factors, including DCR attendance and exposure to other harm reduction services, on the main outcome (HIV-HCV risk practices). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of the French Institute of Medical Research and Health (opinion number: 14-166). The findings of this cohort study will help to assess the impact of DCR on HIV-HCV risk practices and other psycho-social outcomes and trajectories. Moreover, they will enable health authorities to shape health and harm reduction policies according to PWID needs. Finally, they will also help to improve current harm reduction and therapeutic interventions and to create novel ones.

": Achieving a HIV cure has become a research priority. As any improvement of knowledge, which could help scientists design new HIV cure-related clinical trials (HCRCT) depends on the risks potential participants are willing to accept, it is important to understand who will agree or refuse to participate and in which proportions. By providing insights into factors associated with reluctance toward HCRCT participation, our results may help clinicians in patient recruitment.

"Normal human cells in culture become senescent after a limited number of population doublings. Senescent cells display characteristic changes in gene expression, among which is a repression of the ability to induce the c-fos gene. We have proposed a two-stage model for cellular senescence in which the mortality stage 1 (M1) mechanism can be overcome by agents that bind both the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (pRB)-like pocket proteins and p53. In this study we determined whether the repression of c-fos at M1 was downstream of the p53 or pRB-like ""arms"" of the M1 mechanism. We examined c-fos expression during the entire lifespan of normal human fibroblasts carrying E6 (which binds p53), E7 (which binds pRB), or both E6 and E7 of human papilloma virus type 16. The results indicate a dramatic change in cellular physiology at M1. Before M1, c-fos inducibility is controlled by an E6-independent mechanism that is blocked by E7. After M1, c-fos inducibility becomes dependent on E6 whereas E7 has no effect. In addition, a novel oscillation of c-fos expression with an approximately 2-h periodicity appears in E6-expressing fibroblasts post-M1. Accompanying this shift at M1 is a dramatic change in the ability to divide in low serum. Before M1, E6-expressing fibroblasts growth arrest in 0.3% serum, although they continue dividing under those conditions post-M1. These results demonstrate the unique physiology of fibroblasts during the extended lifespan between M1 and M2 and suggest that p53 might participate in the process that represses the c-fos gene at the onset of cellular senescence.

"Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaf Water are obtained from the Mentha piperita plant. The oil is currently used in cosmetic formulations as a fragrance component, but previously had been also described as a denaturant. The extract and leaves are described as biological additives, but only the extract is reported to be used. Peppermint Water is described as a flavoring agent or fragrance component, but is not currently in use. Peppermint Oil is used at a concentration of < or = 3% in rinse-off formulations and < or = 0.2% in leave-on formulations. Peppermint Oil is composed primarily of menthol and menthone. Other possible constituents include pulegone, menthofuran, and limone. Most of the safety test data concern Peppermint Oil. The oil is considered to present the ""worst case scenario"" because of its many constituents, so data on the oil were considered relevant to the entire group of ingredients. Peppermint Oil was minimally toxic in acute oral studies. Short-term and sub-chronic oral studies reported cystlike lesions in the cerebellum in rats that were given doses of Peppermint Oil containing pulegone, pulegone alone, or large amounts (>200 mg/kg/day) of menthone. Pulegone is also a recognized hepatotoxin. Repeated intradermal dosing with Peppermint Oil produced moderate and severe reactions in rabbits, although Peppermint Oil did not appear to be phototoxic. Peppermint Oil was negative in the Ames test and a mouse lymphoma mutagenesis assay but gave equivocal results in a Chinese hamster fibroblast cell chromosome aberration assay. In a carcinogenicity study of toothpaste and its components, no apparent differences were noted between mice treated with Peppermint Oil and those treated with the toothpaste base. Isolated clinical cases of irritation and/or sensitization to Peppermint Oil and/or its constituents have been reported, but Peppermint Oil (8%) was not a sensitizer when tested using a maximization protocol. It was expected that dermal absorption of Peppermint Oil would be rapid, following that of menthol, a major component, but in no case would be greater than absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the toxicity of pulegone, the safe concentration of this constituent was limited to < or = 1%. This concentration was achievable both by controlling the time of harvest and processing technique. There is evidence that menthol can enhance penetration of other agents. Formulators were cautioned that this enhanced penetration can affect the use of other ingredients whose safety assessment was based on their lack of absorption. With the limitation that the concentration of pulegone in these ingredients should not exceed 1%, it was concluded that Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Oil, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Extract, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Leaves, Mentha Piperita (Peppermint) Water are safe as used in cosmetic formulations.

"Combined in vivo and in vitro protocols for the generation of anti-murine cytomegalovirus (anti-MCMV) cytotoxic responses were investigated using BALB/c mice and syngeneic mouse embryo fibroblast target cells. Injections of doses of MCMV from 10(2.6) up to 10(6.1) p.f.u. into the hind footpad, harvest of draining popliteal lymph node cells after 6 to 8 days, followed by 4 days culture of these cells gave similar and optimal cytotoxic activity against MCMV-infected target cells. After injection of 10(4.6) p.f.u. into the hind footpad, MCMV was detectable at about 10(3) to 10(4) p.f.u. per popliteal node after 3 days, but became undetectable in most animals by 6 days. Cell numbers in the draining popliteal lymph node increased following MCMV inoculation into the hind footpad, but the extent of the increase was inversely related to virus dose and bore no relationship to the anti-MCMV cytotoxic potential of the cells. Lymph node cells applied directly to target cells upon harvest from MCMV-infected mice never gave detectable anti-MCMV cytotoxic activity at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 17 or 19 days post-infection, but lysis of uninfected syngeneic targets was obtained 4 to 8 days post-infection.

"The 20th International Symposium on HIV and Emerging Infectious Diseases took place in Marseille, France. It had a refreshing European look with reinforced partnerships with the European AIDS Clinical Society and the British HIV Association and with international speakers and participants. Topics included HIV and global health, HIV and hepatitis cure, the microbiome and immunotherapies, clinical research and methodology, as well as chemsex, pre-exposure prophylaxis, sexually transmitted infections and emerging infectious diseases. Novel areas of research were also described, such as electronic technology in order to improve HIV management, and the expert patient.

"Although NF (nuclear factor)-kappa B binds in vitro to several of the kappa B regulatory elements found in cellular and viral genes, another DNA binding protein, R kappa B, also binds to a related variant of the kappa B site that regulates interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain gene expression, a critical event in T cell activation. Southern blot analysis of a human-mouse somatic cell hybrid panel and in situ hybridization using a fluorescent genomic R kappa B probe have allowed assignment of the R kappa B gene (NFRKB) to 11q24-q25. The NFRKB locus is in close proximity to the chromosomal breakpoint implicated in Ewing sarcoma, but it does not appear to span this region. Nonetheless, NFRKB may be particularly useful as the most telomeric marker thus far assigned to 11q.

"Both reduction of melanocortin signaling and increase in neuropeptide Y signaling in the brain result in obesity. However, where in the brain reduced melanocortin or increased neuropeptide Y signaling mediate these effects is poorly understood. In separate experiments we have injected recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors that overexpressed agouti-related peptide or neuropeptide Y in specific brain regions namely the paraventricular nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus. In this review we compare the results from these studies and discuss these data with previous data from intracerebroventricular or local brain injections. This review shows that the effects of agouti-related peptide clearly differ from those of neuropeptide Y. In addition, these data suggests complementary roles for these neuropeptides in energy balance.

"Given recent profound improvements in the effectiveness of antiviral treatment for chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, we aimed to describe the characteristics of patients referred to hepatology expert centres in France from 2000 to 2007 and from 2010 to 2014, and to identify factors associated with severe liver disease at their first visit for evaluation. We analysed data from two sources covering all of France: the former hepatitis C surveillance network, which included patients between 2000 and 2007, and the ANRS CO22 HEPATHER multi-centre cohort, which included patients between 2012 and 2014. Severe liver disease (SLD) was defined as the presence of either cirrhosis (histological, biochemical or clinical) or hepatocellular carcinoma. Multivariable Poisson regression models were used to identify the factors associated with SLD in complete-case analysis and after multiple imputation. Overall, 16,851 patients were included in the analysis and SLD was diagnosed in 11.6%. SLD at first visit was significantly associated with known risk factors (male sex, history of excessive alcohol intake, HCV genotype 3), late referral to hepatologists after diagnosis and HCV diagnosis at an older age. Providing earlier specialised care and treatment may be an important target for public health action.

"BACKGROUND: The hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza viruses is a possible target for antiviral drugs because of its key roles in the initiation of infection. Although it was found that a natural compound, Stachyflin, inhibited the growth of H1 and H2 but not H3 influenza viruses in MDCK cells, inhibitory activity of the compound has not been assessed against H4-H16 influenza viruses and the precise mechanism of inhibition has not been clarified. METHODS: Inhibitory activity of Stachyflin against H4-H16 influenza viruses, as well as H1-H3 viruses was examined in MDCK cells. To identify factors responsible for the susceptibility of the viruses to this compound, Stachyflin-resistant viruses were selected in MDCK cells and used for computer docking simulation. RESULTS: It was found that in addition to antiviral activity of Stachyflin against influenza viruses of H1 and H2 subtypes, it inhibited replication of viruses of H5 and H6 subtypes, as well as A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in MDCK cells. Stachyflin also inhibited the virus growth in the lungs of mice infected with A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) and A/chicken/Ibaraki/1/2005 (H5N2). Substitution of amino acid residues was found on the HA2 subunit of Stachyflin-resistant viruses. Docking simulation indicated that D37, K51, T107, and K121 are responsible for construction of the cavity for the binding of the compound. In addition, 3-dimensional structure of the cavity of the HA of Stachyflin-susceptible virus strains was different from that of insusceptible virus strains. CONCLUSION: Antiviral activity of Stachyflin was found against A(H1N1)pdm09, H5, and H6 viruses, and identified a potential binding pocket for Stachyflin on the HA. The present results should provide us with useful information for the development of HA inhibitors with more effective and broader spectrum.

"We aimed to describe blood plasma (BP) and seminal plasma (SP) pharmacokinetics of emtricitabine (FTC) in HIV-1-infected men, assess its penetration in the male genital tract, and evaluate its impact on seminal plasma HIV load (spVL) detection. Men from the EVARIST ANRS EP49 study receiving combined antiretroviral therapy with FTC and with suppressed BP viral load were included in the study. A total of 236 and 209 FTC BP and SP concentrations, respectively, were available. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed with Monolix 4.1.4. The impact of FTC seminal exposure on spVL detection was explored by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and mixed-effects logistic regressions. FTC BP pharmacokinetics was described by a two-compartment model. The addition of an effect compartment with different input and output constants best described FTC SP pharmacokinetics. No covariates were found to explain the variability in SP. FTC exposures (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h [AUC0-24]) were higher in SP than in BP (median AUC0-24, 38.04 and 12.95 mg · liter(-1) · h, respectively). The median (range) SP-to-BP AUC0-24 ratio was 2.91 (0.84 to 10.08). Less than 1% of FTC AUC0-24 ratios were lower than 1. The impact of FTC SP AUC0-24 or FTC SP-to-BP AUC0-24 ratio on spVL detection was not significant (P = 0.943 or 0.893, respectively). This is the first population model describing FTC pharmacokinetics simultaneously in both BP and SP. FTC distributes well in the male genital tract with higher FTC concentrations in SP than in BP. FTC seminal plasma exposures were considered efficient in the majority of men.

"Replication-competent retroviral vectors (pFOV-1 to -3 and -7) were constructed on the basis of an infectious human foamy virus molecular clone which has deletions in the U3 region of the long terminal repeat and in the 3' region of the genome, previously identified to be nonessential for virus replication in vitro. The CAT and luciferase indicator genes were expressed as C-terminal fusion proteins to 215 amino acids of the viral Bet protein in the pFOV-1 vector. Introduction of the foot-and-mouth disease 2A protease sequence between the truncated bet coding sequence and the cloning site for the insertion of foreign genes in the pFOV-7 vector resulted in self-cleaving of the recombinant fusion protein. Alternatively, an internal ribosomal binding site was introduced, allowing expression of authentic foreign protein (pFOV-2 and -3 vectors). DNA fragments derived from the mouse hepatitis virus surface gene up to the length of 1.3 kb were inserted into pFOV-1. The vector constructs gave rise to viruses which were fully infectious in diploid human fibroblasts and recombinant viruses stably expressed high levels of foreign protein indicating that the pFOV vectors may be useful tools to study the effects of proteins of interest at least in tissue culture cells.

"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare genetic disorder caused by defects in a DNA damage repair system, the FA pathway. FA patients frequently develop squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) at sites that are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven cancer including the female reproductive tract. To assess experimentally whether FA deficiency increases susceptibility to HPV-associated cervical/vaginal cancer, we monitored cancer incidence in the female lower reproductive tract of FA-deficient mice expressing HPV16 oncogenes, E6 and/or E7. FA deficiency specifically increased the incidence of cancers in mice expressing E7; but this effect was not observed in mice just expressing E6. We also observed that E7, but not E6, induced DNA damage as scored by induction of γ-H2AX and 53BP1 (p53 binding protein 1) nuclear foci, and this induction was heightened in FA-deficient tissue. Finally, we discovered that this induction of DNA damage responses was recapitulated in mice deficient in expression of 'pocket' proteins, pRb, p107 and p130, which are established targets of E7. Our findings support the hypothesis that E7 induces cancer by causing DNA damage at least in part through the inactivation of pocket proteins. This hypothesis explains why a deficiency in DNA damage repair would increase susceptibility to E7-driven cancer.

"We examined the effects of a single exposure to a temperature elevation of 2 degrees C for a 2 h period on the developmental processes of cell division and cell death in the hippocampus and the amygdala of the quokka. Animals aged postnatal day (P) 4045 were injected with tritiated (3H-) thymidine and then exposed to either 37 degrees C (normal) or 39 degrees C (+/-0.2 degrees C) in an incubator for a duration of 2 h. The young were then returned to the nipple and, after a period of 24 h, were sacrificed. Brains were sectioned and selected sections processed for autoradiography, and some were counterstained. Cell division taking place at the time of heating was estimated by counting 3H-thymidine-labelled cells and at the time of sacrifice by counting mitotic figures. Dying cells were visualised as pyknotic profiles in cresyl-violet-stained sections. In both the amygdala and the hippocampus, the number of 3H-thymidine-labelled cells (cells dividing in situ during the heating period) was significantly lower in the experimental than the control group. Such cells were glia in the amygdala and granule cells and glia in the hippocampus. However, the number of dying cells or mitotic figures (cells dividing at the time of sacrifice) did not differ significantly between the two groups. By comparison, the number of 3H-thymidine-labelled cells, dying cells or mitotic figures did not significantly differ in the diencephalon. Therefore, a brief exposure to a slight elevation in temperature results in an immediate alteration in cell division in the hippocampus and amygdala. These findings have implications for the role played by raised temperature, such as during virus infection, in producing developmental anomalies of the brain.

"The Eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) is a classical animal model for studying hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in humans. Recently, we found that Marmota himalayana, an Asian animal species closely related to Marmota monax, is susceptible to woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection and can be used as a new mammalian model for HBV infection. However, the lack of genomic sequence information of both Marmota models strongly limited their application breadth and depth. To address this major obstacle of the Marmota models, we utilized Illumina RNA-Seq technology to sequence the cDNA libraries of liver and spleen samples of two Marmota monax and four Marmota himalayana. In total, over 13 billion nucleotide bases were sequenced and approximately 1.5 billion clean reads were obtained. Following assembly, 106,496 consensus sequences of Marmota monax and 78,483 consensus sequences of Marmota himalayana were detected. For functional annotation, in total 73,603 Unigenes of Marmota monax and 78,483 Unigenes of Marmota himalayana were identified using different databases (NR, NT, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, COG, GO). The Unigenes were aligned by blastx to protein databases to decide the coding DNA sequences (CDS) and in total 41,247 CDS of Marmota monax and 34,033 CDS of Marmota himalayana were predicted. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also analyzed for all Unigenes obtained. Moreover, a large-scale transcriptome comparison was performed and revealed a high similarity in transcriptome sequences between the two marmota species. Our study provides an extensive amount of novel sequence information for Marmota monax and Marmota himalayana. This information may serve as a valuable genomics resource for further molecular, developmental and comparative evolutionary studies, as well as for the identification and characterization of functional genes that are involved in WHV infection and HCC development in the woodchuck model.

"Arc is a cellular immediate-early gene (IEG) that functions at excitatory synapses and is required for learning and memory. We report crystal structures of Arc subdomains that form a bi-lobar architecture remarkably similar to the capsid domain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gag protein. Analysis indicates Arc originated from the Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon family and was ""domesticated"" in higher vertebrates for synaptic functions. The Arc N-terminal lobe evolved a unique hydrophobic pocket that mediates intermolecular binding with synaptic proteins as resolved in complexes with TARPγ2 (Stargazin) and CaMKII peptides and is essential for Arc's synaptic function. A consensus sequence for Arc binding identifies several additional partners that include genes implicated in schizophrenia. Arc N-lobe binding is inhibited by small chemicals suggesting Arc's synaptic action may be druggable. These studies reveal the remarkable evolutionary origin of Arc and provide a structural basis for understanding Arc's contribution to neural plasticity and disease.

"BMS-378806 is a recently discovered small-molecule human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) attachment inhibitor with good antiviral activity and pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we demonstrate that the compound targets viral entry by inhibiting the binding of the HIV-1 envelope gp120 protein to cellular CD4 receptors via a specific and competitive mechanism. BMS-378806 binds directly to gp120 at a stoichiometry of approximately 1:1, with a binding affinity similar to that of soluble CD4. The potential BMS-378806 target site was localized to a specific region within the CD4 binding pocket of gp120 by using HIV-1 gp120 variants carrying either compound-selected resistant substitutions or gp120-CD4 contact site mutations. Mapping of resistance substitutions to the HIV-1 envelope, and the lack of compound activity against a CD4-independent viral infection confirm the gp120-CD4 interactions as the target in infected cells. BMS-378806 therefore serves as a prototype for this new class of antiretroviral agents and validates gp120 as a viable target for small-molecule inhibitors.

"After France removed hepatitis C treatment reimbursement restrictions on 25 May 2016, an expert report presented recommendations, which focused on vulnerable groups including people who inject drugs (PWID). This commentary presents the key points of the chapter with a particular focus on policy. Thanks to the official lifting of restrictions based on disease stage and to the excellent efficacy and tolerance of the new DAA (Direct-Acting Antivirals) among PWID, the main issue is to improve the HCV care cascade. In France, many HCV-infected PWID, especially active/current PWID, remain undiagnosed and unlinked to care. Our challenge is to improve HCV screening by point of care testing (POCT), outreach methods with mobile teams, rapid tests, FibroScan, etc. and to provide PWID with appropriate services in all the settings they attend, such as drug treatment or harm reduction services, social services, prisons, etc. Another important issue is the prevention of reinfection through comprehensive and long-term follow-up. The report recommends a new national policy: testing and treating PWID as a priority, since this is the best way to eliminate HCV infection. It requires a global strategy consisting of combined and long-term interventions: prevention, outreach, screening, DAA, drug treatment programs including opiate substitution treatment (OST) and various harm reduction programs, including needle exchange programs (NEP). Ideally, these services should be delivered in the same place with an integrated approach. This should lead to meeting the national objective set by the government of eliminating hepatitis C by 2025.

"Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a picornavirus of the Cardiovirus genus. Certain strains of TMEV may cause a chronic demyelinating disease, which is very similar to multiple sclerosis in humans, associated with a persistent viral infection in the mouse central nervous system (CNS). Other strains of TMEV only cause an acute infection without persistence in the CNS. It has been shown that sialic acid is a receptor moiety only for the persistent TMEV strains and not for the nonpersistent strains. We report the effect of sialylation on cell surface on entry and the complex structure of DA virus, a persistent TMEV, and the receptor moiety mimic, sialyllactose, refined to a resolution of 3.0 A. The ligand binds to a pocket on the viral surface, composed mainly of the amino acid residues from capsid protein VP2 puff B, in the vicinity of the VP1 loop and VP3 C terminus. The interaction of the receptor moiety with the persistent DA strain provides new understanding for the demyelinating persistent infection in the mouse CNS by TMEV.

"BACKGROUND: Metastatic disease remains the most frequent cause of treatment failure in the management of patients with breast cancer. A novel method that allows delivery of a gene into primary tumor cells was used to generate tumor cell vaccines to inhibit metastasis formation in tumor-bearing hosts. METHODS: Inoculation of 2.5 x 10(4) 4T1 murine breast cancer cells into the footpads of BALB/c mice reliably leads to tumor growth and pulmonary metastases. Interleukin-2 (IL-2)-secreting 4T1 cells (4T1-pMP6A/IL-2) and control transduced 4T1 cells (4T1-pMP6A) were generated by lipofection with a cationic liposome complexed to an adeno-associated viral plasmid bearing the IL-2 gene (pMP6A/IL-2). Unmodified 4T1 cells were inoculated into the footpads on day 0, and weekly immunization with phosphate-buffered saline solution or 2 x 10(6) irradiated 4T1, 4T1-pMP6A, or 4T1-pMP6A/IL-2 cells commenced on day 21. Hindlimb amputation was performed when tumors measured 6 mm in diameter. Mice were killed 24 days after amputation, and metastatic disease was determined by weighing lungs at time of harvest. RESULTS: A significant reduction was seen in the pulmonary metastatic load of mice receiving IL-2 gene-modified tumor cell immunization (4T1-pMP6A/IL2) when compared with mice given control immunizations. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that active immunization strategies with cytokine gene-modified tumor cells generated by clinically relevant gene delivery systems may prove useful in inhibiting the development of metastases from primary breast cancer.

"Influenza A viruses possess both hemagglutinin (HA), which is responsible for binding to the terminal sialic acid of sialyloligosaccharides on the cell surface, and neuraminidase (NA), which contains sialidase activity that removes sialic acid from sialyloligosaccharides. Interplay between HA receptor-binding and NA receptor-destroying sialidase activity appears to be important for replication of the virus. Previous studies by others have shown that influenza A viruses lacking sialidase activity can undergo multiple cycles of replication if sialidase activity is provided exogenously. To investigate the sialidase requirement of influenza viruses further, we generated a series of sialidase-deficient mutants. Although their growth was less efficient than that of the parental NA-dependent virus, these viruses underwent multiple cycles of replication in cell culture, eggs, and mice. To understand the molecular basis of this viral growth adaptation in the absence of sialidase activity, we investigated changes in the HA receptor-binding affinity of the sialidase-deficient mutants. The results show that mutations around the HA receptor-binding pocket reduce the virus's affinity for cellular receptors, compensating for the loss of sialidase. Thus, sialidase activity is not absolutely required in the influenza A virus life cycle but appears to be necessary for efficient virus replication.

"BACKGROUND: Cancer cells exhibit elevated levels of glucose uptake and may obtain pre-formed, diet-derived fatty acids from the bloodstream to boost their rapid growth; they may also use nucleic acid from their microenvironment. The study of processing nucleic acid by cancer cells will help improve the understanding of the metabolism of cancer. DNA is commonly packaged into a viral or lipid particle to be transferred into cells; this process is called transfection in laboratory. Cancer cells are known for having gene mutations and the evolving ability of endocytosis. Their uptake of DNAs might be different from normal cells; they may take in DNAs directly from the environment. In this report, we studied the uptake of DNAs in cancer cells without a transfection reagent. METHODS: A group of DNA fragments were prepared with PCR and labeled with isotope phosphorous-32 to test their uptake by Huh 7 (liver cancer) and THLE3 (normal liver cells) after incubation overnight by counting radioactivity of the cells' genomic DNA. Multiple cell lines including breast cancer and lung cancer were tested with the same method. DNA molecules were also labeled with fluorescence to test the location in the cells using a kit of ""label it fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)"" from Mirus (USA). RESULTS: The data demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma cells possess the ability to take in large DNA fragments directly without a transfection reagent whereas normal liver cells cannot. Huh7 and MDA-MB231 cells displayed a significantly higher Rhodamine density in the cytoplasmic phagosomes and this suggests that the mechanism of uptake of large DNA by cancer cells is likely endocytosis. The efficacy of uptake is related to the DNA's size. Some cell lines of lung cancer and breast cancer also showed similar uptake of DNA. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we have revealed the evidence that some cancer cells, but not nontumorigenic cells, can take DNA fragments directly from the environment without the aid of the transfecting reagent.

"Sendai virus is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, and an enveloped virus with a negative-stranded RNA genome. Sendai virus is not pathogenic to humans, but for mice and can cause pneumonia in mice. Easy and efficient techniques for propagating Sendai virus are required for studying virus replication, virus-induced innate- and adaptive-immunity, Sendai-virus-based virotherapy and IgA nephropathy. Here, we describe a protocol for Sendai virus propagation using chicken eggs. This traditional protocol enables us to generate a large amount of virus enough for animal experiments as well as cell culture experiments in a relatively inexpensive way.

"Ockelbo disease, caused by a Sindbis-related virus transmitted to man by mosquitoes, was first described in the central part of Sweden in the 1960s as clusters of patients with fever, arthralgia and rash. An average annual rate of 30 cases was recorded in the 1980s but no cases have been diagnosed during the last few years. Nephropathia epidemica (NE) characterized by fever, abdominal pain and renal dysfunction has been known to cause considerable morbidity in Sweden during the last 60 years but the etiologic agent (Puumala virus) was not isolated until 1983. This virus's main reservoir is the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus). NE is endemic in the northern two thirds of Sweden where more than a hundred cases are diagnosed each year. Tick-borne encephalitis transmitted by Ixodes ricinus ticks is restricted to the archipelago and Lake M-alaren on the east coast close to Stockholm. Between 30 and 110 cases are diagnosed every year. Inkoo virus, a California encephalitis group virus, has been isolated from mosquitoes in Sweden. The antibody prevalence to Inkoo virus is very high in a normal population, but no disease has as yet been associated with this virus in Sweden. Among the vector-borne virus diseases imported to Sweden, dengue is the most important, with approximately 50 cases recorded every year.

"BACKGROUND: Protease inhibitor monotherapy is a simplified treatment strategy for virally suppressed HIV-positive patients that has the potential for cost savings, as fewer drugs are used than with combination therapy. However, evidence for its economic value is limited. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy followed by treatment intensification in case of viral load rebound versus combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir in HIV-1 infected patients with viral suppression in the ANRS 140 DREAM trial. METHODS: DREAM was conducted in 36 French Hospitals between 2009 and 2013. For each treatment strategy, we estimated the unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted mean costs (in €, year 2010 values) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient, as well as incremental costs and QALYs per patient. We then assessed uncertainty using the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, scenario analyses and cost-effectiveness price-threshold (CEPT) analysis. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis considering 2009-2013 antiretroviral drug (ARV) prices, adjusted incremental costs and QALYs were - €3296 (95% confidence interval [CI] - 5202 to - 1391) and 0.006 (95% CI - 0.021 to 0.033), respectively, over 2 years, suggesting that monotherapy was cost-effective with a probability of 100% at various cost-effectiveness thresholds. In scenario analyses considering 2018 ARV prices, monotherapy remained cost-effective but with a lower probability (94% vs. 100% in the base-case analysis). The current price of cART would have to decrease by 34% to be cost-effective with a probability of 95%. CONCLUSION: Monotherapy appears to be cost-effective compared with cART for virologically suppressed HIV-positive patients in France. CEPT analysis is a useful tool to identify the preferred strategy to adopt given that ARV prices change rapidly. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00946595.

"Many of the factors controlling viral transport and survival within the subsurface are still poorly understood. In order to identify the precise influence of viral isoelectric point on viral adsorption onto aquifer sediment material, we employed five different spherical bacteriophages (MS2, PRD1, Q beta, phi X174, and PM2) having differing isoelectric points (pI 3.9, 4.2, 5.3, 6.6, and 7.3 respectively) in laboratory viral transport studies. We employed conventional batch flowthrough columns, as well as a novel continuously recirculating column, in these studies. In a 0.78-m batch flowthrough column, the smaller phages (MS2, phi X174, and Q beta), which had similar diameters, exhibited maximum effluent concentration/initial concentration values that correlated exactly with their isoelectric points. In the continuously recirculating column, viral adsorption was negatively correlated with the isoelectric points of the viruses. A model of virus migration in the soil columns was created by using a one-dimensional transport model in which kinetic sorption was used. The data suggest that the isoelectric point of a virus is the predetermining factor controlling viral adsorption within aquifers. The data also suggest that when virus particles are more than 60 nm in diameter, viral dimensions become the overriding factor.

"BACKGROUND: The viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) is proposed to act as one of the predominant mediators of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a human herpes virus 8 (HHV8)-elicited disease. The actions of vGPCR manifest pathogenesis, in part, through increased permeability of endothelial cells. Endothelial cell-cell junctions have indeed emerged as an instrumental target involved in the vasculature defects observed within the tumor microenvironment. The pathway leading to adherens junction destabilization has been shown to involve the activation of the small GTPase Rac, in the context of either latent infection or the sole expression of vGPCR. However, the precise molecular mechanisms governed by vGPCR in vascular leakage require further elucidation. FINDINGS: Guanine exchange factors (GEFs) function as critical molecular switches that control the activation of small GTPases. We therefore screened the effects of 80 siRNAs targeting GEFs on vGPCR-driven endothelial permeability and identified switch-associated protein 70 (SWAP70) as necessary for its elevating effects. Pull-down experiments further showed that Rac activation by vGPCR was dependent on SWAP70. Examination of tissues and cells from HHV8-positive patients revealed that SWAP70 was ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, SWAP70 was found to be crucial for vGPCR-driven endothelial tube formation and endothelial sprouting in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: SWAP70 appears to act as a molecular intermediate between vGPCR and endothelial activation. Because of the important role of vGPCR-mediated endothelial plasticity in KS pathogenesis, inhibition of SWAP70 function could be of interest for blocking vGPCR-driven activities in HHV8-defined diseases.

"In September 2011, diagnostic samples were taken from 'Tifway' Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon × C. transvaalensis) tees and from 'Emerald' Zoysia (Zoysia japonica) roughs of a golf course in Charleston, SC. Additional samples were taken from a sod farm located near Charleston, SC from a field of 'Empire' Zoysia. The soil was sandy loam and the samples were taken at a depth of 10 to 15 cm from symptomatic turf. Symptoms on bermudagrass and zoysiagrass included stubby roots and lightly to severely chlorotic or dead patches of irregular sizes and shapes. Nematodes were extracted by sugar centrifugal-flotation and counted. The predominant nematode species recovered was Trichodorus obtusus Cobb, 1913: syn. T. proximus Allen, 1957, n.syn. (3). Nematode densities (per 100 cm(3) of soil) were 30 to 170 (average 94, n = 5) at the sod farm, and 30 to 230 (average 107, n = 7) at the golf course. This nematode has been reported as a pathogen of bermudagrass in Florida, where it is more damaging than Paratrichodorus minor, the other stubby root nematode commonly associated with turfgrass (1). In Florida, 120 T. obtusus individuals per 100 cm(3) is considered high risk (2). We have encountered several additional samples from across South Carolina with comparable densities since our first diagnosis. Infested soil (94 individuals per 100 cm(3)) collected from the sod farm was put into columns and planted with 'Empire' sod and maintained in the greenhouse. After 140 days, the population density increased to an average of 230 individuals per 100 cm3. Plants were prone to wilting and new root growth showed symptoms similar to those observed in the field. Morphologic and morphometric identification of T. obtusus was made by examining male and female specimens in temporary water mounts. Males had ventrally curved spicules with three ventral precloacal papillae, with the posterior papilla just anterior to the head of the retracted spicules, one ventromedian cervical papilla anterior to the excretory pore, and tail with non-thickened terminal cuticle. Females had a deep, barrel-shaped, pore-like vulva, and one or two postadvulvar lateral body pores on each side. Males and females had distinctly offset esophagus. Females (n = 10) were 1,100 to 1,440 (1,250) μm long, body width 40 to 53 (45) μm, onchiostyle 63 to 75 (67) μm, and V 583 to 770 (673) μm. Males (n = 10) were 1,076 to 1,353 (1,222) μm long, body width 33 to 45 (39) μm, onchiostyle 62 to 69 (65) μm, and spicule 55 to 63 (59) μm. From individuals representing the two locations, an 898-bp section of the 18S rDNA region was sequenced using primers 37F (5'-GCCGCGAAAAGCTCATTACAAC-3') and 932R (5'-TATCTGATCGCTGTCGAACC-3') (4). A BLASTn search revealed no similar sequences to those of our two populations (Accessions JX289834 and JX279930). As such, it appears that these are the first sequences of this portion of the 18S rDNA for T. obtusus, although a different, non-overlapping portion of 18S was found in GenBank (AY146460) under the synonym T. proximus. To our knowledge, this is the first report of T. obtusus on zoysiagrass and the first report of the species on bermudagrass in South Carolina. References: (1) W. T. Crow and J. K. Welch.

"A natural recombinant myxoma virus (referred to as ha-MYXV or MYXV-Tol08/18) emerged in the Iberian hare (Lepus granatensis) and the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in late 2018 and mid-2020, respectively. This new virus is genetically distinct from classic myxoma virus (MYXV) strains that caused myxomatosis in rabbits until then, by acquiring an additional 2.8 Kbp insert within the m009L gene that disrupted it into ORFs m009L-a and m009L-b. To distinguish ha-MYXV from classic MYXV strains, we developed a robust qPCR multiplex technique that combines the amplification of the m000.5L/R duplicated gene, conserved in all myxoma virus strains including ha-MYXV, with the amplification of two other genes targeted by the real-time PCR systems designed during this study, specific either for classic MYXV or ha-MYXV strains. The first system targets the boundaries between ORFs m009L-a and m009L-b, only contiguous in classic strains, while the second amplifies a fragment within gene m060L, only present in recombinant MYXV strains. All amplification reactions were validated and normalized by a fourth PCR system directed to a housekeeping gene (18S rRNA) conserved in eukaryotic organisms, including hares and rabbits. The multiplex PCR (mPCR) technique described here was optimized for Taqman(®) and Evagreen(®) systems allowing the detection of as few as nine copies of viral DNA in the sample with an efficiency > 93%. This real-time multiplex is the first fast method available for the differential diagnosis between classic and recombinant MYXV strains, also allowing the detection of co-infections. The system proves to be an essential and effective tool for monitoring the geographical spread of ha-MYXV in the hare and wild rabbit populations, supporting the management of both species in the field.

"To determine the exact map position of the deletion in the genome of HSV-1 strain HFEM, the Bam HI DNA fragment B of the HSV-1 strains HFEM, F, and of HSV-R-HFehx-C19 were cloned in the Bam HI site of the bacterial plasmid vector pAT153 and analysed in detail. Analysis of the insert of the three recombinant plasmids harbouring the Bam HI DNA fragment B of HSV-1 strain F (pHSF-B-B), HSV-1 strain HFEM (pHSHF-B-B), and recombinant HSV-R-HFehx-C19 (pHSR19-B-B) was performed using a variety of restriction enzymes and Southern blot hybridization. These comparative studies revealed that the HpaI DNA fragment P of the intact viral genome of HSV-1 strain F is not present in the genome of HSV-1 strain HFEM, indicating that the deletion in HSV-1 strain HFEM corresponds to this fragment, which spans the coordinates 0.762 to 0.790 of the HSV-1 DNA. The size of the deletion was found to be 4.1 kbp, corresponding to 2.7 Md.

"Autologous stem cell transplantation is used to rescue cancer patients from myelosuppression caused by high-dose chemotherapy. However, autologous grafts often contain tumor cells that can contribute directly to relapse. Current purging methods are useful when fewer than 1% tumor cells contaminate the bone marrow, and patients with tumor burdens of >1% are considered ineligible for chemotherapy that necessitates stem cell rescue. Using neuroblastoma (NB) as a model system, we developed a method that is effective even with tumor burdens of 10-25%. Mixtures of NB-1691 NB cells and CD34(+) hematopoietic cells purged by this method showed no evidence of viable tumor cells as assessed by clonogenic assays or reverse transcription-PCR for the NB cell markers tyrosine hydroxylase and N-MYC. The efficacy and lack of toxicity of the method were verified using in vivo mouse models. Severe combined immunodeficient mice that received purged cell preparations containing 10% NB-1691 cells survived without evidence of disease for the observation period (>1 year), whereas mice that received unpurged cells developed disseminated disease requiring euthanasia 73-96 days after injection of cells. No evidence of toxicity to the mice was detected by numerous laboratory values for bone marrow, liver, and kidney function, and no difference was seen in the ability of purged cell mixtures versus unmanipulated CD34(+) cells to reconstitute the marrow of non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice. In a pilot study, marrow was obtained from eight patients who had >/=1% metastatic tumor burden. All eight samples were purged to the level of detection by reverse transcription-PCR (samples from seven patients) or clonogenic potential (sample from one patient), whichever assay was used. The described adenovirus/rabbit carboxylesterase/CPT-11 (irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin) virus-directed enzyme prodrug method may be useful for patients whose tumor burdens exceed 1% at the time of stem cell harvest. Assessment of purging efficacy with additional samples from NB patients is ongoing.

"Epidemic-epizootic Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) viruses (VEEV) have emerged repeatedly via convergent evolution from enzootic predecessors. However, previous sequence analyses have failed to identify common sets of nucleotide or amino acid substitutions associated with all emergence events. During 1993 and 1996, VEEV subtype IE epizootics occurred on the Pacific Coast of the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca in southern Mexico. Like other epizootic VEEV strains, when inoculated into guinea pigs and mice, the Mexican isolates were no more virulent than closely related enzootic strains, complicating genetic studies of VEE emergence. Complete genomic sequences of 4 of the Mexican strains were determined and compared to those of closely related enzootic subtype IE isolates from Guatemala. The epizootic viruses were less than 2% different at the nucleotide sequence level, and phylogenetic relationships confirmed that the equine-virulent Mexican strains probably evolved from enzootic progenitors on the Pacific Coast of Mexico or Guatemala. Of 35 amino acids that varied among the Guatemalan and Mexican isolates, only 8 were predicted phylogenetically to have accompanied the phenotypic change. One mutation at position 117 of the E2 envelope glycoprotein, involving replacement of Glu by Lys, resulted in a small-plaque phenotype characteristic of epizootic VEEV strains. Analysis of additional E2 sequences from representative enzootic and epizootic VEEV isolates implicated similar surface charge changes in the emergence of previous South American epizootic phenotypes, indicating that E2 mutations are probably important determinants of the equine-virulent phenotype and of VEE emergence. Maximum-likelihood analysis indicated that one change at E2 position 213 has been influenced by positive selection and convergent evolution of the epizootic phenotype.

"Recently a new virus has been described which infects woodchucks, Marmota monax. This virus, named woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is closely related to human hepatitis virus (HBV). The virions have the same principal antigenic system involving surface and core determinants and a serological relationship has been found. WHV has also a DNA polymerase associated with the core. It has previously been reported that trisodium phosphonoformate (PFA) but not phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) inhibits DNA polymerase associated with HBV. This investigation shows the same type of inhibition pattern by PFA and PAA on WHV DNA polymerase.

"Despite the finding in European rabbit and other leporid genomes of the first ever described endogenous lentivirus and of a European rabbit exclusive endogenous gammaretrovirus, until now no exogenous retroviruses have been isolated in Lagomorpha species. Nevertheless, looking for the presence of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in the species genomes could lead to the discovery of retroviral lineages yet to be found in Lagomorpha. Different mammalian genomes harbor endogenous viral sequences phylogenetically close to the betaretrovirus mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), propelling us to look for such retroviral ""fossil"" in American pika (Ochotona princeps) and European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) genomes. By performing genomic mining using MMTV gag and LTR as query sequences, we found that such viral elements were absent from the European rabbit genome. Oppositely, significant matches were found in American pika, and more importantly, a nearly complete MMTV-like virus (Pika-BERV) was identified. Using Pika-BERV gag and LTR as templates, we found similar sequences endogenized in different pika (Ochotona sp.) species. The orthology of the LTR flanking region between some pika species supported shared ancestry of specific endogenous betaretroviruses, while in other pika species similar sequences, but not orthologous, should have resulted from independent insertions. Our study supports the possible existence of infecting exogenous betaretroviruses for a long term, after the divergence of Ochotonidae from Leporidae, but yet to be identified.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: GS-9688 (selgantolimod) is an oral selective small molecule agonist of toll-like receptor 8 in clinical development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral efficacy of GS-9688 in woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), a hepadnavirus closely related to hepatitis B virus. APPROACH AND RESULTS: WHV-infected woodchucks received eight weekly oral doses of vehicle, 1 mg/kg GS-9688, or 3 mg/kg GS-9688. Vehicle and 1 mg/kg GS-9688 had no antiviral effect, whereas 3 mg/kg GS-9688 induced a >5 log(10) reduction in serum viral load and reduced WHV surface antigen (WHsAg) levels to below the limit of detection in half of the treated woodchucks. In these animals, the antiviral response was maintained until the end of the study (>5 months after the end of treatment). GS-9688 treatment reduced intrahepatic WHV RNA and DNA levels by >95% in animals in which the antiviral response was sustained after treatment cessation, and these woodchucks also developed detectable anti-WHsAg antibodies. The antiviral efficacy of weekly oral dosing with 3 mg/kg GS-9688 was confirmed in a second woodchuck study. The antiviral response to GS-9688 did not correlate with systemic GS-9688 or cytokine levels but was associated with transient elevation of liver injury biomarkers and enhanced proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to WHV peptides. Transcriptomic analysis of liver biopsies taken prior to treatment suggested that T follicular helper cells and various other immune cell subsets may play a role in the antiviral response to GS-9688. CONCLUSIONS: Finite, short-duration treatment with a clinically relevant dose of GS-9688 is well tolerated and can induce a sustained antiviral response in WHV-infected woodchucks; the identification of a baseline intrahepatic transcriptional signature associated with response to GS-9688 treatment provides insights into the immune mechanisms that mediate this antiviral effect.

"JC virus (JCV) is a ubiquitous human papovavirus that shares sequence and structural homology with simian virus 40 (SV40). In contrast to SV40, expression of JCV is restricted to a small number of cell types, including human fetal glial cells, uroepithelial cells, amnion cells, and some endothelial cells. To study the control of JCV early region expression, we made heterokaryons and stable hybrids between JCV-transformed hamster glial cells and mouse fibroblasts. Binucleate heterokaryons exhibited extinction of large tumor antigen expression in the hamster nuclei as assayed by indirect immunofluorescence. This extinction was both time and dose dependent: extinction reached maximal levels at 24-36 hr after fusion and was dependent on the ratio of glial cell to fibroblast nuclei in multinucleated heterokaryons. Extinction also was observed in stable hybrids between the glial cells and mouse Ltk- cells. Southern blot analysis showed that the extinguished hybrids contained viral sequences. Reexpression of large tumor antigen was observed in several subclones, suggesting that extinction was correlated with the loss of murine fibroblast chromosomes from these hybrids. The cis-acting region that mediates extinction resides within the viral regulatory region, which contains two 98-base-pair repeats that have enhancer activity. These data demonstrate that cellular factors that negatively regulate viral gene expression contribute to the restricted cell-type specificity of this virus.

"A focused library of twenty-one cationic poly(amino ethers) was synthesized following ring-opening polymerization of two diglycidyl ethers by different oligoamines. The polymers were screened in parallel for plasmid DNA (pDNA) delivery, and transgene expression efficacies of individual polymers were compared to those of 25 kDa polyethylenimine (PEI), a current standard for polymer-mediated transgene delivery. Seven lead polymers that demonstrated higher transgene expression than PEI in pancreatic and prostate cancer cells lines were identified from the screen. All seven lead polymers showed highest transgene expression at a polymer:pDNA weight ratio of 5:1 in the MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line. Among the conditions studied, transgene expression efficacy correlated with minimal polymer cytotoxicity but not polyplex sizes. In addition, this study indicated that methylene spacing between amine centers in the monomers, amine content, and molecular weight of the polymers are all significant factors and should be considered when designing polymers for transgene delivery. A lead effective polymer was employed for coating gold nanorods, leading to theranostic nanoassemblies that possess combined transgene delivery and optical imaging capabilities, leading to potential theranostic systems.

"Retinoblastoma protein (RB) acts as a tumor suppressor in many tissue types, by promoting cell arrest via E2F-mediated transcriptional repression. In addition to the aberrant forms of the RB gene found in different types of cancers, many viral oncoproteins including the simian virus 40 large T antigen target RB. However, cellular factors that inhibit RB function remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that RB interacts with the high mobility group protein A1 (HMGA1), a-non-histone architectural chromatin factor that is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells. HMGA1 binds the small pocket domain of RB, and competes with HDAC1. Subsequently, overexpression of HMGA1 abolishes the inhibitory effect of RB on E2F-activated transcription from the cyclin E promoter. Under serum starvation, T98G cells had been previously shown to be arrested in the G0 phase in an RB-mediated manner. The G0 phase was characterized by growth arrest and low levels of transcription, together with the hypophosphorylation of RB and the downregulation of HMGA1. In contrast, such serum-depleted G0 arrest was abrogated in T98G cells overexpressing HMGA1. The overexpressed HMGA1 was found to form complexes with cellular RB, suggesting that downregulation of HMGA1 is required for G0 arrest. There were no phenotypic changes in HMGA1-expressing T98G cells in the presence of serum, but the persistent expression of HMGA1 under serum starvation caused various nuclear abnormalities, which were similarly induced in T antigen-expressing T98G cells. Our present findings indicate that overexpression of HMGA1 disturbs RB-mediated cell arrest, suggesting a negative control of RB by HMGA1.

"Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a severe respiratory disease with high mortality caused by rodent-borne hantaviruses, has previously been identified in the United States and Canada as well as central and southern South America. In late 1999 and early 2000, an outbreak of acute illness compatible with HPS was reported in Los Santos, Panama, with the death of 3 of the 12 (25%) suspected cases. Hantavirus-specific antibodies were detected in patient sera, and virus RNA was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis of virus genome N-, G1-, and G2-encoding fragments showed this to be a novel hantavirus, Choclo virus. Serologic and virus genetic analyses of rodents trapped in the area showed Oligoryzomys fulvescens to be the likely reservoir for the HPS-associated Choclo virus. In addition, Zygodontomys brevicauda rodents were shown to harbor another genetically unique hantavirus, Calabazo virus.

"We previously established that H-2M3a, the H chain of the maternally transmitted Ag (Mta), is specialized for presentation of N-formylated peptides. We hypothesized that the N-formyl group might prevent or limit the presentation of peptide Ag by H-2K and H-2D molecules. We now show by Mta- and OVA-specific CTL assays, peptide competition, and immunofluorescence analyses that N-formyl modification of four antigenic peptides inhibited their binding by either H-2Kb (OVAMet258-264, VSVNP52-59, and SVNP324-332) or H2-Db (SVNP324-332, and IVNP366-374). In contrast, N-formyl-OVAMet258-264 did bind to H2-M3a. The data imply lack of an N-formyl-binding pocket in classical MHC class I molecules and are consistent with a specialized role for H2-M3a in presentation of N-formylated peptides such as derived from intracellular prokaryotic parasites.

"The bank vole (Myodes glareolus) is the natural host of Puumala virus (PUUV) in vast areas of Europe. PUUV is one of the hantaviruses which are transmitted to humans by infected rodents. PUUV causes a general mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) called nephropathia epidemica (NE). Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases generally display clear spatial patterns due to different space-dependent factors. Land cover influences disease transmission by controlling both the spatial distribution of vectors or hosts, as well as by facilitating the human contact with them. In this study the use of ecological niche modelling (ENM) for predicting the geographical distribution of bank vole population on the basis of spatial climate information is tested. The Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) is used to model the ecological niche of bank voles in Western Europe. The meteorological data, land cover types and geo-referenced points representing the locations of the bank voles (latitude/longitude) in the study area are used as the primary model input value. The predictive accuracy of the bank vole ecologic niche model was significant (training accuracy of 86%). The output of the GARP models based on the 50% subsets of points used for testing the model showed an accuracy of 75%. Compared with random models, the probability of such high predictivity was low (χ(2) tests, p < 10(-6)). As such, the GARP models were predictive and the used ecologic niche model indeed indicates the ecologic requirements of bank voles. This approach successfully identified the areas of infection risk across the study area. The result suggests that the niche modelling approach can be implemented in a next step towards the development of new tools for monitoring the bank vole's population.

"Myxoma virus (MV) is a poxvirus that evolved in Sylvilagus lagomorphs, and is the causative agent of myxomatosis in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). This virus is not a natural pathogen of O. cuniculus, yet is able to subvert the host rabbit immune system defenses and cause a highly lethal systemic infection. The interaction of MV proteins and the rabbit immune system has been an ideal model to help elucidate host/poxvirus interactions, and has led to a greater understanding of how other poxvirus pathogens are able to cause disease in their respective hosts. This review will examine how MV causes myxomatosis, by examining a selection of the identified immunomodulatory proteins that this virus expresses to subvert the immune and inflammatory pathways of infected rabbit hosts.

"Somatic gene therapy has been proposed as a method of treating various metabolic diseases and conditions associated with a deficiency in secretory proteins. The intestine, because of its accessibility, large size, rapid rate of cell turnover, and known location of stem cells, is an attractive site for retroviral gene therapy. Stem cells in the intestine are known to reside in the crypts of Lieberkühn. In this study the IEC-6 cell line, derived from rat intestinal crypt cells, was used as an in vitro model to study the feasibility and dynamics of retroviral gene transfer in intestinal cells. Using a replication-deficient retrovirus, we delivered a reporter gene, bacterial beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) into NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and IEC-6 cells. Successful transduction was measured by X-gal histochemistry. Viral titers on IEC-6 cells were lower than on NIH-3T3 cells but were within the same order of magnitude. Gene transfer increased linearly with retroviral concentration up to a 1:5 dilution of retroviral supernatant. With undiluted viral medium, gene transfer was inhibited and this effect was more pronounced with the IEC-6 cells. The negative effect of the undiluted retroviral supernatant was minimized by decreasing the harvest time from the packaging cell line. An optimal plating density 12 h prior to infection was found to be approximately 10(5) cells/6-cm dish in both cell lines. The infection rate was proportionally enhanced by the use of multiple infections. In conclusion, under ideal conditions, the IEC-6 cells were infected at similar levels of efficacy as NIH-3T3 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

"Reverse transcriptase (RT) is an appropriate target for anti-HIV chemotherapy. In recent years several entirely new leads for the design of different structural classes of HIV-1-specific RT inhibitors were provided (also called non-nucleoside RT inhibitors or NNRTI). We performed profound studies on (i) the structure-antiviral activity relationship of TSAO (a prototype NNRTI compound), (ii) the biochemical and molecular mechanism of anti-viral action of TSAO and other NNRTI's, (iii) metabolism and antimetabolic effects of TSAO's in cell culture, and (iv) the pharmacokinetic properties of TSAO in mice. In addition, the molecular basis of resistance development of HIV-1 RT against other NNRTI's have also been profoundly studied. A mapping of the resistance mutations in the binding pocket of the RT and the sensitivity/resistance spectrum of the most important NNRTI's that are subject of clinical trials have been determined. Based on the information that became evident from these studies, a molecular model of interaction of the NNRTI inhibitor TSAO with the binding pocket in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase has been proposed, and now provide the rational basis for the development of second generation TSAO molecules that may become suppressive to mutant HIV-1 strains. Also, resistance development could be markedly delayed, modulated, attenuated, or even fully suppressed by at least two different original approaches: (i) the knock-out drug concentration principle that exploits the limited capacity of mutant HIV-1 reverse transcriptases to respond to high NNRTI drug concentrations and (ii) the rational paired drug combination therapy that exploits the mutually exclusive sensitivity/resistance properties of NNRTI drugs against the different NNRTI-specific resistance mutations in the RT. Our findings have provided us with several powerful tools to have a more efficient chemotherapeutic impact on the HIV-1 infection and to better control the emergence of viral resistance.

"Yellow fever virus (YF) is the prototype member of the Flavivirus genus. Here, we report the successful construction of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the vaccine strain YF-17D. YF cDNA was cloned into a low-copy-number plasmid backbone and stably maintained in several E. coli strains. Transcribed RNAs had a specific infectivity of 10(5)-10(6) p.f.u. ( micro g RNA)(-1), and the resulting virus exhibited growth kinetics, plaque morphology and proteolytic processing similar to the parental virus in cell culture. This clone was used to analyse the importance of conserved flavivirus RNA sequences and the 3' stem-loop structure in virus replication. The conserved sequences 5'CS and CS1, as well as the 3' stem-loop structure, were found to be essential for virus replication in cell culture, whereas the conserved sequence CS2 and the region containing YF-specific repeated sequences were dispensable. This infectious clone will aid future studies on YF replication and pathogenesis, as well as facilitate the development of YF-17D-based recombinant vaccines.

"The novel hydroxyurea derivatives of l- and d-amino acid amides 5a-l were prepared by aminolysis of N-(1-benzotriazolecarbonyl)-amino acid amides 4a-f with O-benzylhydroxylamine and N-methylhydroxylamine and evaluated for their antiviral and cytostatic activity against malignant tumor cell lines and normal human fibroblasts. Compounds 5a, 5c, 5e and 5k showed the highest antiproliferative effects against all tumor cell lines tested. The strongest non-specific cytostatic activities against HeLa cells were affected by compounds 5a, 5c, 5e and 5k on MCF-7 cells by 5c, 5e and 5k and MIA PACa-2 cells by 5c and 5k. Differential effects at micromolar concentrations were observed for compounds 5a, 5c, 5e, 5k and 5l in Hep G2 cells, for compounds 5c, 5e, 5k and 5l in PC-3 cells and for compounds 5e, 5k and 5l in SW 620 cells.

"Interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine with well known antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, and immunostimulatory properties. Chronic allograft rejection, characterized by vascular neointimal proliferation, is a major cause of organ transplant loss, particularly in heart and kidney transplant recipients. In a Dark Agouti to Lewis rat model of aortic transplantation, we evaluated the effects of a single intramuscular injection of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (serotype 1) encoding IL-10 (rAAV1-IL-10) on neointimal proliferation and inflammation. rAAV1-IL-10 treatment resulted in a significant reduction of neointimal proliferation and graft infiltration with macrophages and T and B lymphocytes. The mechanism underlying the protective effects of IL-10 in aortic allografts involved heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) because inhibition of HO activity reversed not only neointimal proliferation but also inflammatory cell infiltration. Our results indicate that IL-10 attenuates neointimal proliferation and inflammatory infiltration and strongly imply that HO-1 is an important intermediary through which IL-10 regulates the inflammatory responses associated with chronic vascular rejection.

"Two aspects of abiotic transport of nucleopolyhedrovirus from soil to cotton plants were examined in greenhouse experiments: the distance from the plants and depth in soil from which the virus could be transported under controlled conditions of soil type and moisture, wind, and precipitation. Transport distance and depth were tested separately under relatively conducive (precipitation/sandy soil and wind/clay soil) and non-conducive (precipitation/clay soil and wind/sandy soil) conditions, as determined in previous research. The amount of virus transported by precipitation generally decreased as distance from the plant increased, but in wind the amounts of virus transported were best described by polynomial models, with transport efficiency usually peaking at a distance of 60 cm. Depending on plant height and tissue, the farthest distances that virus was transported ranged from 30 to 60 cm by precipitation from clay soil, 60-75 cm in precipitation/sand, 60-80 cm in wind/clay, and 60-80 cm in wind/sand. In the depth experiments, transport by precipitation and wind generally decreased as the depth of virus in soil increased. The greatest depth from which NPV was transported ranged from 0 to 0.5 cm by precipitation from clay soil, 0.5-1.0 cm in precipitation/sand, 1.0-2.0 cm in wind/clay, and 0.5-1.0 cm in wind/sand. All of the experimental parameters (distance or depth, soil type, plant height, plant tissue) and all two-way interactions significantly (P<0.05) affected transport in all four experiments, except for the ""soilxplant tissue"" interaction in the depth/wind experiment. In all of the experiments, transport was significantly greater (P<0.05) to lower than to upper portions of plants and to leaves than to buds and squares. Transport was significantly greater from sandy soil than from clay in precipitation, and it was greater from clay than from sandy soil in wind. The results will contribute to NPV epizootiology, microbial control, and risk assessment.

"A series of diverse small molecules have been designed and synthesized through structure-based drug design by taking advantage of fragment merging and elaboration approaches. Compounds ZL0420 (28) and ZL0454 (35) were identified as potent and selective BRD4 inhibitors with nanomolar binding affinities to bromodomains (BDs) of BRD4. Both of them can be well docked into the acetyl-lysine (KAc) binding pocket of BRD4, forming key interactions including the critical hydrogen bonds with Asn140 directly and Tyr97 indirectly via a H(2)O molecule. Both compounds 28 and 35 exhibited submicromolar potency of inhibiting the TLR3-dependent innate immune gene program, including ISG54, ISG56, IL-8, and Groβ genes in cultured human small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs). More importantly, they also demonstrated potent efficacy reducing airway inflammation in a mouse model with low toxicity, indicating a proof of concept that BRD4 inhibitors may offer the therapeutic potential to block the viral-induced airway inflammation.

"The bacteriophage P1 packaging site (pac) cleavage enzyme (pacase) consists of two phage encoded proteins, PacA and PacB. Both proteins are necessary for the recognition and cleavage of pac and for subsequent packaging of cleaved DNA into phage particles. We have purified PacA to homogeneity from a bacterial strain that overproduces the protein. Purified PacA complements an Escherichia coli extract containing the PacB protein for DNA cleavage at the pac site and recognizes and binds to methylated pac DNA independently of PacB in gel retardation experiments. The latter property of PacA is absolutely dependent on the presence of a wildtype E. coli extract, suggesting that E. coli host proteins play a role in the pac cleavage reaction.

"Thymidine kinase negative mouse (LATK-) and hamster (BHKTK-) cells were transfected with a recombinant plasmid (pTK1) carrying the thymidine kinase gene of HSV-1 by iontophoretic pricking or iontophoretic microinjection techniques. Transfection frequencies were measured using short term survival and long term transformation assays and were found to be at the level of 10 to 15% and 1 to 2% respectively for mouse or hamster cells transfected with pTK1. The presence of covalently linked transcriptional enhancers from SV40 or Moloney MSV increased long term transformation frequencies approximately 10-fold. Transfection by iontophoretic pricking of non-tumorigenic mouse (NIH3T3) or hamster (BHKC13) cells with a recombinant (pAGT1) carrying the human T24 Ha-ras1 oncogene and the bacterial aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph) gene as a selectable marker resulted in transformation of these cells. Southern blot hybridization analyses demonstrated the presence of circular, integrated or rearranged donor DNA molecules in the transformed cells. These gene transfer techniques and iontophoretic pricking in particular should be useful for the transfection of a variety of cell lines and markers.

"The PacA and PacB subunits of the bacteriophage P1 DNA packaging enzyme (pacase) are necessary for cleavage of the phage packaging site (pac). In the accompanying paper, we show that the PacA subunit of the enzyme specifically binds to pac in the absence of PacB, but requires factors present in an Escherichia coli extract to do so. We show here that either of two E. coli DNA binding proteins, integration host factor (IHF) or HU, can replace this extract and promote the binding of PacA to pac. IHF binds to pac independently of PacA and DNase I footprinting experiments show that IHF protects approximately 40 bp of DNA around an IHF consensus sequence adjacent to the cleavage site. DNase I footprinting experiments also show that in the presence of either IHF or HU, PacA binds to the hexanucleotide sequences (5'-TGATCA/G) that flank the cleavage site and that have been previously shown to be essential for pac cleavage. The importance of IHF and HU in pac cleavage is further demonstrated by the severe reduction in both the fidelity and efficiency of pac cleavage in vitro with extracts lacking both IHF and HU. Addition of either IHF or HU to the deficient extracts renders them fully proficient for pac cleavage. Finally, we show that IHF bends DNA at the IHF site within pac. Based on these results, we propose a model that can account for the role of the various phage and host proteins, and for DNA bending in the pac cleavage reaction.

"A 1-year-old, intact, male dwarf rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) was vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease in February 1999, and a localized reaction appeared in the same anatomic site within a few days. No regression was observed after subcutaneous antibiotic treatment. The rabbit was kept under observation, and the swelling apparently disappeared in 3 months. The owner then decided to avoid any further subcutaneous drug administration. The referring veterinarian examined the animal on July 2006 for the sudden appearance of a nodular, 4.5 cm x 3.5 cm x 2.0 cm, subcutaneous mass located over the interscapular space. Fine-needle aspiration was performed, and a population of neoplastic spindle cells, rare pleomorphic multinucleated cells, and rare leukocytes were observed. The mass was surgically removed, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, and routinely processed for histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical diagnostic investigation. The neoplastic tissue exhibited fascicles composed of malignant spindle-shaped cells with elongated to oval hyperchromatic nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Occasional multinucleated cells were also observed. The neoplastic cells were immunoreactive for vimentin but did not stain for smooth muscle actin, desmin, myoglobin, and cytokeratins (AE1/AE3). Moreover, the histochemical stain for aluminum was positive. The diagnosis was fibrosarcoma based on morphologic and immunohistochemical results. The histologic features of this neoplasm were remarkably similar to feline injection-site sarcoma.

"In France, around 25% of the estimated number of people living with HIV are migrants, of whom three quarters are from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Our objective was to determine factors associated with virological rebound (VR) at the occasion of a transient stay to the country of origin. HIV-positive migrants from SSA participating to the ANRS-VIHVO adherence study between 2006 and 2009, on effective ART with controlled pre-travel HIV-1 plasma viral load (VL), were included. Outcome was VR, defined as VL ≥ 50 copies/ml at the post-travel visit during the week following the return to France. Among 237 persons (61.6% female, median age 41 years (IQR, 35-47), median time on ART 4.2 years (IQR, 2.2-7.1), 27 (11.4%) experienced VR. The main purpose of the travel was to visit family and median time spent abroad was 5.3 weeks (IQR, 4.1-8.8). The travel was extended longer than anticipated by at least 1 week in 42 individuals (17.7%). In multivariable logistic model, risk factors for VR were male sex [adjusted OR (aOR) 5.1; 95% CI 1.6-16.2)], no employment in France (aOR 2.0; 1.2-3.5), self-reported non-adherence during the trip (aOR 14.9; 4.9-45.9) and PI-containing regimen (aOR 4.6; 1.2-17.6). In another analysis not including self-reported adherence, traveling during Ramadan while respecting the fast (aOR 3.3; 1.2-9.6) and extension of the stay (aOR 3.0; 1.1-7.8) were associated with VR. Virological rebound was partly explained by structural barriers to adherence such as extension of the travel and inadequate management of Ramadan fasting. Individuals' journeys should be carefully planned with health care providers.

"A study on the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) has been performed in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (PACA) region, South of France, where Maghrebian migrants represent 10% of the population. During the years 1986-1990, 76 cases of NPC were diagnosed, of which 44 were French by birth, 25 were Maghrebian migrants and 7 were other migrants. We found that 36% of the French patients were either born in endemic areas or had lived there for more than 15 years. Standardized annual incidence rates of NPC among Maghrebian migrants remained close to those observed in North Africa, while, standardized annual incidence rates for French by birth in the PACA region were similar to those observed in cancer registries in other regions of France and countries of low incidence. However, for males of French origin born in Maghrebian countries, the incidence of NPC (all cases being of undifferentiated type) was 5.7 times higher than that of males of French origin born in France (p = 0.00001). These results favor a critical role of environmental factors in the risk of NPC.

"Current vaccine strategies against the asexual blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum are mostly focused on well-studied merozoite antigens that induce immune responses after natural exposure, but have yet to induce robust protection in any clinical trial. Here we compare human-compatible viral-vectored vaccines targeting ten different blood-stage antigens. We show that the full-length P. falciparum reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 (PfRH5) is highly susceptible to cross-strain neutralizing vaccine-induced antibodies, out-performing all other antigens delivered by the same vaccine platform. We find that, despite being susceptible to antibody, PfRH5 is unlikely to be under substantial immune selection pressure; there is minimal acquisition of anti-PfRH5 IgG antibodies in malaria-exposed Kenyans. These data challenge the widespread beliefs that any merozoite antigen that is highly susceptible to immune attack would be subject to significant levels of antigenic polymorphism, and that erythrocyte invasion by P. falciparum is a degenerate process involving a series of parallel redundant pathways.

"Sindbis virus (SINV) is the prototype member of the Alphavirus genus, whose members cause severe human diseases for which there is no specific treatment. To ascertain host factors important in the replication of the SINV RNA genome, we generated a SINV expressing nsP4, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, with an in-frame 3xFlag epitope tag. Proteomic analysis of nsP4-containing complexes isolated from cells infected with the tagged virus revealed 29 associated host proteins. Of these, 10 proteins were associated only at a later time of infection (12 h), 14 were associated both early and late, and five were isolated only at the earlier time (6 h postinfection). These results demonstrate the dynamic nature of the virus-host interaction that occurs over the course of infection and suggest that different host proteins may be required for the multiple functions carried out by nsP4. Two related proteins found in association with nsP4 at both times of infection, GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and G3BP2 were also previously identified as associated with SINV nsP2 and nsP3. We demonstrate a likely overlapping role for these host factors in limiting SINV replication events. The present study also identifies 10 host factors associated with nsP4 6 h after infection that were not found to be associated with nsP2 or nsP3. These factors are candidates for playing important roles in the RNA replication process. Identifying host factors essential for replication should lead to new strategies to interrupt alphavirus replication.

"AIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish inactivation decay constants of foodborne pathogens and coliphage in clay and sandy soils for future ""downstream"" analyses such as quantitative microbial risk analysis and to compare cultivation-dependent and -independent (e.g. qPCR) methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Salmonella enterica, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Clostridium perfringens, were seeded together with MS2 and ØX174 phages, into three waste matrices (Class B biosolids, swine lagoon effluent, cattle manure), and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as a control, and applied to two soil types (sandy loam, clay loam) using two management practices (incorporated, surface applied). S. enterica and L. monocytogenes inactivation rates were positively affected (e.g. slower rate) by solid wastes, while C. jejuni was quickly inactivated by day 7 regardless of waste type. The use of qPCR provided more conservative inactivation rates, with qPCR-based rates typically twice as slow as cultivation-based. The effect of soil type and management were less apparent as rates were variably affected. For instance, incorporation of waste negatively impacted (e.g. faster rate) inactivation of Salmonella when measured by qPCR, while the opposite was true when measured by cultivation. Inactivation rates were organism∗waste∗soil∗management dependent since the interactions of these main effects significantly affected most combinations. CONCLUSIONS: Class B biosolids and cattle manure most often slowed inactivation when measured by cultivation, but the complex interactions between variables and organism made sweeping conclusions difficult. On the contrary cultivation-independent inactivation rates were negatively affected by solid wastes. Inactivation rates developed by cultivation-dependent and -independent assays needs further scrutiny as interprerations can vary by orders of magnitude depending on the organism∗environment combination. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study compares decay rate data based on waste, soil, management and assay type which can be further used in risk assessments.

"We used mouse-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids which lose mouse chromosomes to examine the distribution of murine leukemia virus DNA sequences in the genome of A/HeJ mice. We analyzed total cellular DNA from various hybrid clones for the presence of viral sequences by molecular hybridization and used the Southern blot hybridization procedure to identify viral DNA in cellular restriction endonuclease fragments. Our results show that murine leukemia virus DNA sequences are distributed among many mouse chromosomes in this strain. Chromosome 4 was shown to contain murine leukemia virus DNA sequences.

"Over the past 30 years, significant advances have transformed the landscape of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care in the emergency department. Diagnosis and management of HIV has improved, resulting in a decline in the incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining infections. Advances in pharmacology have led to fewer serious medication toxicities and more tolerable regimens. Emergency providers have played an increasingly important role in HIV screening and diagnosis of acute infection. Provision of postexposure prophylaxis is expanding from a focus on occupational exposure to include all high-risk cases.

"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) causes a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Europe. Seven genetic lineages of PUUV have thus far been recorded, which exhibit geographic structure within the distribution of its natural host, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). This study presents evidence for two distinct PUUV lineages co-circulating in Latvia: one previously described from Russia and a novel one that appears to be endemic. The Latvian lineage (LAT) is considerably divergent and several amino acid markers make it easily distinguishable. Phylogenetic analysis suggested a possibility of different evolutionary histories for the PUUV genome segments of LAT.

"Anaplasma phagocytophilum was used to infect Peromyscus leucopus mice by three routes of inoculation: infected tick infestation and intraperitoneal (IP) and subcutaneous (SQ) injection of infected tissue culture cells. A set of 12 mice were infected (four tick, four IP, and four SQ), and blood was drawn at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21, 28, 35, and 60 days post-infection and analyzed by use of a quantitative PCR assay to assess the level of infection. An additional set of 108 mice were infected (36 tick, 36 IP, 36 SQ) and euthanized at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 21, 28, and 35 days post-infection (four mice/time point), and blood, spleen, bone marrow, and bladder tissue samples were analyzed. Tick infection generally produced the highest average levels of infection and peaked at 9 days post-infestation in blood, spleen, and bone marrow and at 6 days after infestation in the bladder. IP injection resulted in levels of infection that peaked on day 6 (spleen) or 12 (bladder, bone marrow, and blood). A. phagocytophilum injected SQ showed low levels of infection, and the day of peak infection varied. The average level of infection in the blood drawstressed mice was consistently higher and peaked earlier than infection in the non-stressed, euthanized mice. Xenodiagnosis was used to assay a third set of 12 mice (four tick, four IP, and four SQ) on days 7 and 14 post-infection and ticks fed on tick-infected mice showed the highest rate of PCR-positive test results at both time points (day 7, 22.2%; day 14, 17.3%). These data indicate that P. leucopus mice can be infected by tick infestation, IP injection, or SQ injection but that the kinetics and level of infection are quite variable among individual mice, may be influenced by the route of inoculation, and may be further altered by common laboratory procedures such as repeated collection of blood samples.

"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of dynamic resistance exercise to generate skeletal muscle-derived follistatin like-1 (FSTL1), which may induce cardioprotection in rats following myocardial infarction (MI) by inducing angiogenesis. METHODS: Male, adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 12 in each group): sham group (S), sedentary MI group (MI), MI + resistance exercise group (MR), MI + adeno-associated virus (AAV)-FSTL1 injection group (MA), and MI + AAV-FSTL1 injection + resistance exercise group (MAR). The AAV-FSTL1 vector was prepared by molecular biology methods and injected into the anterior tibialis muscle. The MI model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Rats in the MR and MAR groups underwent 4 weeks of dynamic resistance exercise training using a weighted climbing-up ladder. Heart function was evaluated by hemodynamic measures. Collagen volume fraction of myocardium was observed and analyzed by Masson's staining. Human umbilical vein vessel endothelial cells culture and recombinant human FSTL1 protein or transforming growth factor-β receptor 1 (TGFβR1) inhibitor treatment were used to elucidate the molecular signaling mechanism of FSTL1. Angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and disco interacting protein 2 homolog A (DIP2A) location were observed by immunofluorescence staining. The expression of FSTL1, DIP2A, and the activation of signaling pathways were detected by Western blotting. Angiogenesis of endothelial cells was observed by tubule experiment. One-way analysis of variance and Student's t test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Resistance exercise stimulated the secretion of skeletal muscle FSTL1, which promoted myocardial angiogenesis, inhibited pathological remodeling, and protected cardiac function in MI rats. Exercise facilitated skeletal muscle FSTL1 to play a role in protecting the heart. Exogenous FSTL1 promoted the human umbilical vein vessel endothelial cells proliferation and up-regulated the expression of DIP2A, while TGFβR1 inhibitor intervention down-regulated the phosphorylation level of Smad2/3 and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, which was not conducive to angiogenesis. FSTL1 bound to the receptor, DIP2A, to regulate angiogenesis mainly through the Smad2/3 signaling pathway. FSTL1-DIP2A directly activated Smad2/3 and was not affected by TGFβR1. CONCLUSION: Dynamic resistance exercise stimulates the expression of skeletal muscle-derived FSTL1, which could supplement the insufficiency of cardiac FSTL1 and promote cardiac rehabilitation through the DIP2A-Smad2/3 signaling pathway in MI rats.

"BACKGROUND: The influenza virus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality for diabetics. The seasonal influenza vaccine's immunologic effectiveness is proven within the type 1 and type 2 diabetic populations, but the level of evidence is low. This article presents a systematic review for the bias in the measure of the effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccination among diabetics. METHODS: Using systematic review methods, we searched three electronic databases for published literature (MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library) and two grey literature (SIGLE and NHS EED) databases, to identify studies published between 1997 and 2013, examining the effect of seasonal influenza vaccination, among diabetics, on any measure for influenza morbidity or mortality. RESULTS: 725 records were identified from the three databases and screening, short-listing was undertaken independently by two reviewers. After de-duplication, all records were screened by title and then abstract, and 34 short-listed records were reviewed in full, with 7 studies included: 4 cohort studies and 3 case-control studies, conducted in 7 countries. The most common outcome of interest in studies (n=4) was all-cause mortality among elderly diabetics (>65 years), with individual studies reporting reductions in risk of between 33% [95%CI: 4%-54%] and 68% [95%CI: 58%-75%]. We found only two studies for working-age adult diabetics: one reporting that vaccination prevented hospitalizations due to pneumonia or influenza (vaccine effectiveness [VE] 43%, [95%CI: 28%-54%]) and all-cause hospitalizations (VE: 28% [95%CI: 24%-32%]); and, another reporting no significant decrease in all-cause mortality for working-age adult diabetics. We have identified three major biases: the use of indirect health outcomes, a risk of selection bias (health-seeking bias), and no adjustment for participant pneumococcal vaccination status. The most recent included article finds that morbimortality is still lower during off-season influenza in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated diabetics, indicating important residual confounding. CONCLUSION: To date, the strength of evidence supporting the routine use of seasonal influenza vaccination is low for diabetics older than 65, and very low for working-age diabetics.

"A sequence of four amino acid residues amino-terminal to the only intramolecular disulphide bond of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmembrane protein gp41 is recognized by an anti-idiotypic antibody (9G5A) raised against another monoclonal antibody (M38), which recognizes the C5 region of gp120. 9G5A is an Ab2 beta antibody (internal image of the M38 epitope) in that it inhibits the interaction of M38 to its antigen. The binding of 9G5A to gp41 can be inhibited by M38 showing that the two antibodies interact via their paratopes. 9G5A neutralizes HIV-1 infection and syncytia formation. Ab3 antibodies induced in mice and rabbits immunized with 9G5A also can neutralize virus in both assays. These data show that the M38-defined epitope of the carboxy-terminal region of gp120 interacts with the 9G5A-defined epitope of gp41, and that this interaction can be reproduced by the idiotypic mimicry of the two antibodies. The results are consistent with a proposed molecular model of the two env regions which predicts the presence, within the C5 region of gp120, of a large intramolecular pocket that is contacted by the gp41 cysteine loop.

"BACKGROUND: The contemporary crisis of trust in vaccines has severely impaired acceptance of the HPV vaccine, especially in France, where its uptake culminated at 23.7% in 2018 (complete course at age 16). Physicians' recommendations strongly influence its acceptance/refusal. Our study sought to understand the decision processes leading physicians to recommend this vaccine (or not). METHODS: Qualitative interviews of French physicians (general practitioners, gynecologists, and pediatricians). We first randomly selected doctors in a national register of medical professionals and then resorted to snowballing to build a convenience sample. We coded the interviews in a thematic analysis built both inductively and deductively from our research questions and data. RESULTS: Two thirds of the participants (19/28) were favorable to HPV vaccination, some (4) opposed it, while the others were hesitant about recommending it. In explaining their opinions, most participants mentioned that they trusted the stakeholders within the vaccination system: the less trust they had, the more critical they were of the vaccine and the more importance they attributed to patients' opinions. We identified three different ways they interacted with patients on this topic: informing and convincing; adapting to patients' opinions; refusing compromise about vaccination. Crossing these various themes, we found 5 types of physicians: dissidents (mistrustful of the healthcare system and HPV vaccine), hesitant (finding it difficult to make up their minds about this vaccination), laissez-faire (letting patients decide by themselves, but very favorable to HPV vaccination), educator (very favorable), and uncompromising vaccinators (refusing debate). Pediatricians were overrepresented among the latter two types. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' judgment was influenced by their trust in the stakeholders involved in designing and implementing the HPV vaccination strategy. In this sense, doctors did not differ substantially from laypeople. They were, nonetheless, strongly influenced by their professional style and ethos.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) overexpress several members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of ligands and the type I FGF receptor (FGFR-1), and enhanced FGF-2 protein levels correlate with shorter postoperative survival of patients with PDAC. In this study, we investigated the effects of FGF-2 on cell proliferation and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation before and after abrogation of FGFR-1-dependent signaling in 4 pancreatic cancer cell lines (ASPC-1, COLO-357, MIA-PaCa-2, and PANC-1). Signaling was blocked by infecting the cells with an adenoviral vector encoding for a truncated FGFR-1 (AdtrFGFR-1). FGF-2 enhanced the growth of all 4 cell lines and activated MAPK in 3 of these cell lines. Infection with the AdtrFGFR-1 virus resulted in abundant expression of the truncated FGFR-1 at the RNA and protein level, markedly attenuated FGF-2-induced proliferation in all 4 tested cell lines, and decreased FGF-2-dependent MAPK activation in the 3 cell lines in which FGF-2 activated this pathway. These findings suggest that FGFR-1-mediated mitogenesis in multiple pancreatic cancer cells can be efficiently blocked with an adenoviral vector encoding a truncated FGFR-1, raising the possibility that AdtrFGFR-1 may ultimately have a therapeutic role in PDAC.

"We have previously shown that SSYA10-001 blocks severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication by inhibiting SARS-CoV helicase (nsp13). Here, we show that SSYA10-001 also inhibits replication of two other coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). A putative binding pocket for SSYA10-001 was identified and shown to be similar in SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and MHV helicases. These studies show that it is possible to target multiple coronaviruses through broad-spectrum inhibitors.

"Hypothalamic brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key element in the regulation of energy balance. Here we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of BDNF by gene transfer in mouse models of obesity and diabetes. Gene transfer of BDNF led to marked weight loss and alleviation of obesity-associated insulin resistance. To facilitate clinical translation and ensure that BDNF protein expression was appropriately decreased as weight loss progressed, thus preventing cachexia, we developed a molecular autoregulatory system involving a single recombinant adeno-associated virus vector harboring two expression cassettes, one constitutively driving BDNF and the other driving a specific microRNA targeting BDNF. The microRNA element was controlled by a promoter (that controlling the Agrp gene encoding agouti-related peptide) responsive to BDNF-induced physiological changes. Hence, as body weight decreased and agouti-related protein is induced, microRNA expression was activated, inhibiting transgene expression. In contrast to the progressive weight loss associated with a nonregulated approach, this microRNA-approach led to a sustainable plateau of body weight after notable weight loss was achieved. This strategy mimics the body's endogenous physiological feedback mechanisms, thereby resetting the hypothalamic set point to reverse obesity and metabolic syndrome.

"In pediatric emergency departments (PEDs), seasonal viral outbreaks are believed to be associated with an increase of workload, but no quantification of this impact has been published. A retrospective cross-sectional study aimed to measure this impact on crowding and health care quality in PED. The study was performed in 1 PED for 3 years. Visits related to bronchiolitis, influenza, and gastroenteritis were defined using discharge diagnoses. The daily epidemic load (DEL) was the proportion of visits related to one of these diagnoses. The daily mean of 8 crowding indicators (selected in a published Delphi study) was used. A total of 93,976 children were admitted (bronchiolitis, 2253; influenza, 1277; gastroenteritis, 7678). The mean DEL was 10.4% (maximum, 33.6%). The correlation between the DEL and each indicator was significant. The correlation was stronger for bronchiolitis (Pearson R from 0.171 for number of hospitalization to 0.358 for length of stay). Between the first and fourth quartiles of the DEL, a significant increase, between 50% (patients left without being seen) and 8% (patient physician ratio), of all the indicators was observed. In conclusion, seasonal viral outbreaks have a strong impact on crowding and quality of care. The evolution of ""patients left without being seen"" between the first and fourth quartiles of DEL could be used as an indicator reflecting the capacity of adaptation of an emergency department to outbreaks.

"INTRODUCTION: The objective was to compare safety of pediatric percutaneous liver biopsy (PLB) performed by fellows or staff physicians. METHODS: Outcomes of 212 PLB completed by first-year pediatric gastroenterology fellows or by staff physicians over 8 years were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Approximately 81.5% of the biopsies were completed by trainees. No significant differences were found between groups (fellows vs staff) regarding number of punctures (median of 1.7 for both), nonrepresentative biopsies (4.2% vs 2.6%), and hemoglobin drop (median of 0.7 vs 0.5 g/L). DISCUSSION: Complications of pediatric PLB are uncommon and did not differ among physicians with different training levels.

"The Eastern woodchuck, Marmota monax, has been a useful model system for the study of the natural history of hepadnavirus infection and for the development and preclinical testing of antiviral therapies. The model has also been used for hepatitis delta virus (HDV). In this chapter several new applications of the woodchuck model of HDV infection are presented and discussed. The development of a woodchuck HDV inoculum derived from a molecular clone has facilitated the analysis of viral genetic changes occurring during acute and chronic infection. This analysis has provided insights into one of the more important aspects of the natural history of HDV infection-whether a superinfection becomes chronic. These results could renew interest in further vaccine development. An effective therapy for chronic HDV infection remains an important clinical goal for this agent, particularly because of the severity of the disease and the inability of current hepadnaviral therapies to ameliorate it. The recent application of the woodchuck model of chronic HDV infection to therapeutic development has yielded promising results which indicate that targeting the hepadnavirus surface protein may be a successful therapeutic strategy for HDV.

"This review examines neuroanatomical and functional alterations in rodents resulting from postnatal insults during cerebellar development. Treatments such as irradiation and methylazoxymethanol (MAM) administration produced near birth (< postnatal day 8 for irradiation treatment and < postnatal day 4 for MAM administration) result in more severe cerebellar damage than do similar treatments administered several days after birth. Prominent among the more severe alterations are foliation abnormalities, misalignment of Purkinje cells and continued multiple innervation of climbing fibers; few or none of these occur as a result of later treatments (> postnatal day 8 for irradiation treatment and > postnatal day 4 for MAM treatment). The functional alterations also differ: insults produced near birth result in hypoactivity, ataxia, tremor and accompanying learning deficits, whereas those produced later result in hyperactivity and few learning deficits. This hyperactivity may have relevance to human disorders. Brief discussions of cerebellar and functional alterations (e.g., hyperactivity) resulting from neonatal infection with the Borna disease virus and induction of hypo- and hyperthyroidism during the preweaning period are also presented.

"This report reviews recent observations regarding the association of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA sequences with brain and bone tumours of childhood [1-3]. Our initial investigation was suggested by the tumorigenicity of SV40 in animals, and the transgenic mouse expression of SV40 large T-antigen in which all animals developed choroid plexus (CP) tumours. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis and DNA sequencing demonstrated SV40-like DNA sequences, amplified from the ""Rb-pocket"" binding domain of the viral large T-antigen, in 10/20 CP and 10/11 ependymoma tumours of children. The PCR analysis was subsequently extended to three additional regions of the viral genome: the carboxy-terminal region of large T-antigen, the viral enhancer/origin, and the VP1 gene. All amplified products were related to SV40 sequences. Furthermore, because one individual in the original brain tumour study was a member of a Li-Fraumeni kindred, 151 DNA samples from such families were analysed. Only 18 were positive for viral sequences and 11 of these were isolated from individuals with osteosarcomas. This observation led to a further analysis of DNA from bone tumours, in which 54/160 samples contained SV40-like sequences. These studies associate SV40-like sequences with human CP, ependymoma, and bone tumours. A causal relationship to human oncogenesis remains a subject for further study.

"An adenovirus-5 recombinant virus Adapt1 carrying the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (aprt) gene was constructed by insertion of a 2.5-kb fragment containing the complete CHO aprt structural gene linked to a Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) promoter into the E3 region of adenovirus-5. The CHO aprt gene was in the opposite orientation to the adenovirus E3 promoter. Mouse Lapt- tk- (LAT) cells expressed the CHO aprt gene when infected with the virus, even at low MOI (O.1). APRT activity was detectable from approximately 20 h postinfection. At a low frequency, LAT cells were transformed to aprt+, and four stable transductants were selected in adenine, azaserine (AA) medium. Such cells expressed APRT at approximately 50% wild-type activity and the enzyme was shown to be CHO APRT by starch gel electrophoresis. DNA was isolated from the transductants and probed with CHO aprt-specific DNA and with viral DNA probes. The results indicated that the CHO aprt gene was integrated into the LAT cells at a site other than mouse aprt. Although neighboring viral sequences were integrated and maintained in the transductants, viral sequences further upstream and downstream of the aprt gene were absent.

"Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disease due to deficiency in alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA) that results in accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) throughout the body, causing numerous clinical defects. Intravenous administration of a gamma-retroviral vector (gamma-RV) with an intact long terminal repeat (LTR) reduced the clinical manifestations of MPS I, but could cause insertional mutagenesis. Although self-inactivating (SIN) gamma-RVs in which the enhancer and promoter elements in the viral LTR are absent after transduction reduces this risk, such vectors could be less effective. This report demonstrates that intravenous (i.v.) injection of a SIN gamma-RV expressing canine IDUA from the liver-specific human alpha(1)-antitrypsin promoter into adult or newborn MPS I mice completely prevents biochemical abnormalities in several organs, and improved bone disease, vision, hearing, and aorta to a similar extent as was seen with administration of the LTR-intact vector to adults. Improvements were less profound than when using an LTR-intact gamma-RV in newborns, which likely reflects a lower level of transduction and expression for the SIN vector-transduced mice, and might be overcome by using a higher dose of SIN vector. A SIN gamma-RV vector ameliorates clinical manifestations of MPS I in mice and should be safer than an LTR-intact gamma-RV.

"Antiviral agents are increasingly considered an option for veterinary medicine. An understanding of their mechanism of activity is important to plan their administration either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. Previous studies have shown that the broad spectrum antiviral agent favipiravir (T-705) and its derivatives T-1105 and T-1106 are efficient inhibitors of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication in cell culture and in vivo. However, no mechanism for their activity against FMDV has been proposed. In the present study we show that favipiravir (T-705) can act as a lethal mutagen for FMDV in cell culture. Evidence includes virus extinction associated with increase in mutation frequency in the mutant spectrum of 860 residues of the 3D (polymerase)-coding region, and a decrease of specific infectivity while the consensus nucleotide sequence of the region analyzed remained invariant. The mutational spectrum evoked by favipiravir differs from that observed with other viruses in that no predominant transition type is observed, indicating that a movement towards A,U- or G,C-rich regions of sequence space is not a prerequisite for virus extinction. We discuss prospects for the use of favipiravir to assist in the control of FMDV, and its possible broader use in veterinary medicine as an extension of its current status as antiviral agent for human influenza virus.

"Abelson murine leukemia virus (Ab-MLV) encodes the v-Abl protein tyrosine kinase and induces transformation of immortalized fibroblast lines and pre-B cells. Temperature-sensitive mutations affecting the kinase domain of the protein have demonstrated that the kinase activity is absolutely required for transformation. Despite this requirement, mutations affecting other regions of v-Abl modulate transformation activity. The SH2 domain and the highly conserved FLVRES motif within it form a phosphotyrosine-binding pocket that is required for interactions between the kinase and cellular substrates. To understand the impact of SH2 alterations on Ab-MLV-mediated transformation, we studied the Ab-MLV mutant P120/R273K. This mutant encodes a v-Abl protein in which the beta B5 arginine at the base of the phosphotyrosine-binding pocket has been replaced by a lysine. Unexpectedly, infection of NIH 3T3 or pre-B cells with P120/R273K revealed a temperature-dependent transformation phenotype. At 34 degrees C, P120/R273K transformed about 10-fold fewer cells than wild-type virus of equivalent titer; at 39.5 degrees C, 300-fold fewer NIH 3T3 cells were transformed and pre-B cells were refractory to transformation. Temperature-dependent transformation was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of Shc, a protein that interacts with the v-Abl SH2 and links the protein to Ras, and decreased induction of c-Myc expression. These data suggest that alteration of the FLVRES pocket affects the ability of v-Abl to interact with at least some of its substrates in a temperature-dependent fashion and identify a novel type of temperature-sensitive Abelson virus.

"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced against the G, M2 and N proteins of bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) and 29 were selected for further study. Thirteen neutralizing MAbs were assigned to one conformation-independent and at least two conformation-dependent antigenic sites on the G protein by a competitive binding ELISA. The panel of MAbs were tested by neutralization and immunofluorescence with three strains of BEFV and three BEFV-related viruses. The results indicated that BEFV strains from different sources were not identical and that the M2 protein was the least variable of the proteins investigated. Passive protection studies in mice showed that the correlation between neutralizing titre and resistance to challenge was 0.85 (P less than 0.001).

"The treatment of gynecologic and other infections in obstetric patients involves consideration of the physiologic changes of pregnancy, the clinical implications of the infection for the patient as well as the fetus, and the safety of antimicrobials available for therapy. This article highlights the treatment of infections of the vagina, uterus, and urinary tract, with a focus on how therapy changes in obstetric patients. In addition, the emergency department management of other clinically important infections in pregnancy, such as those caused by the human immunodeficiency virus, influenza viruses, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Parvovirus, Listeria, and others is reviewed.

"BACKGROUND: FKBP8 is a multifunctional protein involved in many distinct processes like formation of central nervous system, viral RNA replication and inhibition of apoptosis. Fkbp8 expression was reported in different tissues, various cell lines and malignancies, in the latter displaying changes during carcinogenesis. Loss of Fkbp8 leads to substantial neurodegenerations during regular mouse development, thus hearing onset in mice could also potentially depend on Fkbp8 expression. Since Fkbp8 is crucial for patterning of neuronal function, we studied its expression during maturation of the rodent auditory function. METHODS: Fkbp8 gene expression in rodent cochlear samples was studied by RT-PCR, qPCR, and western blot. Localization of Fkbp8 transcripts and protein was analyzed by in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Studies of auditory organ demonstrate that Fkbp8 gene activity is increasing just before hearing onset and gradually decreasing after onset of hearing. Western blot analysis suggests substantial levels of Fkbp8 protein before hearing onset, and slow degradation after onset of hearing. The Fkbp8 mRNA is localized in spiral ganglion of cochlea but its distribution changes over time to the stria vascularis, a finding supported by immunohistochemistry staining. Additionally, in pre-hearing time Fkbp8-specific signal was also observed in the tectorial membrane, whose α- and β-Tectorin components show similar time-dependent expression of mRNA as Fkbp8. CONCLUSION: These results indicate a temporal shift in expression of Fkbp8 which correlates with cochlear maturation, strongly suggesting a contribution of Fkbp8 to the onset of the rodent hearing processes.

"Powassan virus (POWV) disease is a rare human disease caused by a tick-borne encephalitis group flavivirus maintained in a transmission cycle between Ixodes cookei and other ixodid ticks and small and medium-sized mammals. During 1958-1998, only 27 POWV disease cases (mostly Powassan encephalitis) were reported from eastern Canada and the northeastern United States (average, 0.7 cases per year). During 1999-2005, nine cases (described herein) of serologically confirmed POWV disease were reported in the United States (average, 1.3 cases per year): four from Maine, two from New York, and one each from Michigan, Vermont, and Wisconsin. The Michigan and Wisconsin cases are the first ever reported from the north-central United States. Of these nine patients, 5 (56%) were men, the median age was 69 years (range: 25-91 years), and 6 (67%) had onset during May-July. All but one patient developed encephalitis with acute onset of profound muscle weakness, confusion, and other severe neurologic signs. In one case, no neurologic symptoms were present but the presence of pleocytosis, an elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration, and POWV-specific immunoglobulin M in CSF suggested neuroinvasion. All patients recovered from their acute disease, but most had long-term neurologic sequelae. Periresidential ecologic investigations were performed in three cases, including tests of local mammals and ticks for evidence of POWV infection. Woodchucks (Marmota monax), striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), and a raccoon (Procyon lotor) collected at two of the Maine case-patients' residences had neutralizing antibody titers to POWV. I. cookei were found on woodchucks and skunks and questing in grassy areas of one of these residences; all were negative for POWV. Although POWV disease is rare, it is probably under-recognized, and it causes significant morbidity, and thus is an additional tick-borne emerging infectious disease entity. Because no vaccine or specific therapy is available, the basis of prevention is personal protection from ticks (or ""tick hygiene"") and reduced exposure to peridomestic wild mammals.

"The effects of membrane tension on fusion between cells expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus and red blood cells were studied by capacitance measurements. Inflation of an HA-expressing cell was achieved by applying a positive hydrostatic pressure to its interior through a patch-clamp pipette in the whole-cell configuration. Inflating cells to the maximum extent possible without lysis created a membrane tension and completely inhibited low-pH-induced fusion at room temperature. Fully inflated cells that were subsequently deflated to normal size resumed the ability to fuse in response to low pH. At the higher temperature of 32 degrees C, fusion conditions were sufficiently optimal that full inflation did not hinder fusion, and once formed, pores enlarged more rapidly than those of never inflated cells. It is suggested that under fusogenic conditions HA causes the formation of a dimple within the membrane in which it resides, and that membrane tension hinders fusion by preventing the formation of dimples. Because dimpling bends the bilayer portion of bound membranes so that they come into intimate contact, the damping of dimpling would suppress this initial step in the fusion process.

"Arenaviruses are the collective name for viruses, which belong to the family Arenaviridae. They replicate in the cytoplasm of cells, and were named after the sandy (Latin, arenosus) appearance of the ribosomes often seen in thin sections of virions under electron microscope. Several arenaviruses, such as Lassa virus in West Africa, and Junin, Guanarito, Sabia, Machupo, and Chapare viruses in South America, cause sever viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) in humans and represent a serious public health problem. These viruses are categorized as category 1 pathogens thus should be handles in a BSL4 laboratory. Recently, Lujo virus was isolated as a newly discovered novel arenavirus associated with a VHF outbreak in southern Africa in 2008. Although, we have no VHF patients caused by arenaviruses in Japan, except for a single imported Lassa fever case in 1987, it is possible that VHF patients occur as imported cases as for other VHF in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the diagnostics and therapeutics in consideration of patient's severe symptoms and high mortality even in the disease-free countries. In this review, we will broadly discuss the current knowledge from the basic researches to diagnostics and vaccine developments for arenavirus diseases.

"In August 2017, an autochthonous chikungunya case was reported in south-east France. By mid-September, eight additional autochthonous cases were found in the index case's neighbourhood, where the chikungunya virus vector Aedes albopictus was observed. Genomic characterisation identified an East-Central South African (ECSA) lineage strain, probably from the Central African region and carrying an adaptive mutation facilitating transmission by Ae. albopictus. The event confirms we need early case detection and response to contain chikungunya in Europe.

"Cleavage at four sites (3/4A, 4A/4B, 4B/5A, and 5A/5B) in the hepatitis C virus polyprotein requires a viral serine protease activity residing in the N-terminal one-third of the NS3 protein. Sequence comparison of the residues flanking these cleavage sites reveals conserved features including an acidic residue (Asp or Glu) at the P6 position, a Cys or Thr residue at the P1 position, and a Ser or Ala residue at the P1' position. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to assess the importance of these and other residues for NS3 protease-dependent cleavages. Substitutions at the P7 to P2' positions of the 4A/4B site had varied effects on cleavage efficiency. Only Arg at the P1 position or Pro at P1' substantially blocked processing at this site. Leu was tolerated at the P1 position, whereas five other substitutions allowed various degrees of cleavage. Substitutions with positively charged or other hydrophilic residues at the P7, P3, P2, and P2' positions did not reduce cleavage efficiency. Five substitutions examined at the P6 position allowed complete cleavage, demonstrating that an acidic residue at this position is not essential. Parallel results were obtained with substrates containing an active NS3 protease domain in cis or when the protease domain was supplied in trans. Selected substitutions blocking or inhibiting cleavage at the 4A/4B site were also examined at the 3/4A, 4B/5A, and 5A/5B sites. For a given substitution, a site-dependent gradient in the degree of inhibition was observed, with a 3/4A site being least sensitive to mutagenesis, followed by the 4A/4B, 4B/5A, and 5A/5B sites. In most cases, mutations abolishing cleavage at one site did not affect processing at the other serine protease-dependent sites. However, mutations at the 3/4A site which inhibited cleavage also interfered with processing at the 4B/5A site. Finally, during the course of these studies an additional NS3 protease-dependent cleavage site has been identified in the NS4B region.

"Carcinomas establish a molecular cross talk between malignant tumor cells and the activated non-malignant cells of the tumor stroma. This cell-cell communication in tumor-stroma interaction includes soluble, secreted proteins that act in a paracrine or autocrine manner. Proteases are crucial factors in tumor-stroma interaction by degrading or truncating secreted bioactive proteins. The cysteine protease cathepsin B is frequently overexpressed in several cancer types, including breast cancer. Its abundance often correlates with poor prognosis. In the murine polyoma virus middle T oncogene (PyMT) breast cancer model, cathepsin B is equally pro-tumorigenic. In this study, we investigate how cathepsin B shapes the secreted proteome of PyMT breast cancers. We employed a novel strategy to harvest tumor interstitial fluid (IF) in combination with chemical stable isotope tagging for quantitative proteomic comparison of IF stemming from PyMT tumors from wild-type mice, mice lacking cathepsin B, and mice over-expressing human cathepsin B. In three biological replicates, we achieve good proteome coverage (∼1700 proteins), with a large content (>70%) of secreted proteins. This characterizes IF as a robust source for the investigation of cancer secretomes. We also identified a large number of shed ectodomains, thus highlighting the importance of tumor-contextual cell surface proteolysis. Furthermore, IF contained >190 proteases and protease inhibitors, which span the entire range of absolute protein abundances; an observation testifying for an important role of proteolysis in tumor-stroma interaction. The cathepsin B genotype consistently affected proteins including alpha-1B-glycoprotein and major urinary proteins 11 and 8 (MUP8). Our study establishes tumor IF as a rich source for the investigation of secreted proteins in tumor biology and sheds light on complex proteolytic networks in the breast cancer secretome.

"Large-scale production and concentration procedures have been standardized to study the biological properties of Rauscher leukemia virus produced from the high-passaged JLS-V9-H mouse bone marrow cell line. Virus produced early (days 4 to 6) in the harvest and refeed cycle contained higher levels of ribonucleic acid-directed deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity and was more infectious than Rauscher leukemia virus produced later (days 7 to 10) in the growth period. The peak of virus production as detected by physical assays (virus particle count, protein, and p30 antigen) was highest at day 6, whereas the optimum biological and ribonucleic acid-directed deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity occurred 24 h earlier. When product characterization values of each concentrate were adjusted to a specific activity (i.e., per milligram of protein) basis, virus particle counts averaged 4 x 10(11) through days 5 to 9, and the peak infectivity occurred at day 4, whereas ribonucleic acid-directed deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity was highest at day 4 (endogenous) and 5 (exogenous). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel analysis revealed only slight differences in the polypeptide pattern of Rauscher leukemia virus harvested from cultures of varying age, although Rauscher leukemia virus produced between days 3 and 5 contained more glycoprotein than either earlier or later harvests.

"Influenza A virus remains a major threat to public health worldwide after its first pandemic. Scientists keep searching novel anti-influenza drugs, of which natural products present to be an important source. Myricetin, a natural flavonol compound, which exists in many edible plants, which has a wide range of biological activities, but its anti-influenza A virus activity is ambiguous. This study aims to evaluate the anti-influenza activity of myricetin and elucidate its underlying mechanism. Our results demonstrated that myricetin could significantly inhibit influenza A virus replication, reduce viral polymerase activity via selective inhibition of viral PB2 subunit, and the production of inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting TLR3 signaling pathway. The binding affinity analysis and the result of molecular docking revealed that myricetin interacted with the PB2 cap-binding pocket of influenza A virus. The above results suggested myricetin could exhibit anti-influenza virus activity with low cytotoxicity as well, and myricetin had low toxicity in BALB/c mice in vivo. Results from this study highlighted myricetin could be considered as a promising anti-influenza virus agent with dual inhibition profile. Furthermore, the compound with similar structure would provide a new option for the development of novel inhibitors against influenza A virus.

"For many gene therapy applications the effective titre of retroviral vectors is a limiting factor both in vitro and in vivo. Purification and concentration of retrovirus from packaging cell supernatant can overcome this problem. To this end we have investigated a novel procedure which involves complexing retrovirus to a dense and particulate substrate followed by a short low-speed centrifugation. The study reported here uses heat-killed, formaldehyde fixed Staphylococcus aureus (Pansorbin) absorbed to PG13 derived retrovirus. This complex was then used to harvest retrovirus from packaging cell supernatant: centrifugation and washing of this complex allows the retrovirus to be both purified and concentrated. This procedure increases the effective titre of retrovirus by up to 7500-fold after an only 200-fold reduction in volume. The affinity of Pansorbin for retrovirus allows concentration regardless of its encoded genes and makes this protocol applicable to other popular packaging cells and envelope proteins. Possible explanations for the marked increase in titre of concentrated virus and the mechanism governing the complexing of retrovirus to Pansorbin are discussed.

"The host factor and interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) product, zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), inhibits a number of diverse viruses by usurping and intersecting with multiple cellular pathways. To elucidate its antiviral mechanism, we perform a loss-of-function genome-wide RNAi screen to identify cellular cofactors required for ZAP antiviral activity against the prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV). In order to exclude off-target effects, we carry out stringent confirmatory assays to verify the top hits. Important ZAP-liaising partners identified include proteins involved in membrane ion permeability, type I IFN signaling, and post-translational protein modification. The factor contributing most to the antiviral function of ZAP is TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin and ISG15 ligase. We demonstrate here that TRIM25 interacts with ZAP through the SPRY domain, and TRIM25 mutants lacking the RING or coiled coil domain fail to stimulate ZAP's antiviral activity, suggesting that both TRIM25 ligase activity and its ability to form oligomers are critical for its cofactor function. TRIM25 increases the modification of both the short and long ZAP isoforms by K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin, although ubiquitination of ZAP does not directly affect its antiviral activity. However, TRIM25 is critical for ZAP's ability to inhibit translation of the incoming SINV genome. Taken together, these data uncover TRIM25 as a bona fide ZAP cofactor that leads to increased ZAP modification enhancing its translational inhibition activity.

"PRMT6 is a protein arginine methyltransferase involved in transcriptional regulation, human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis, DNA base excision repair, and cell cycle progression. Like other PRMTs, PRMT6 is overexpressed in several cancer types and is therefore considered as a potential anti-cancer drug target. In the present study, we described six crystal structures of PRMT6 from Mus musculus, solved and refined at 1.34 Å for the highest resolution structure. The crystal structures revealed that the folding of the helix αX is required to stabilize a productive active site before methylation of the bound peptide can occur. In the absence of cofactor, metal cations can be found in the catalytic pocket at the expected position of the guanidinium moiety of the target arginine substrate. Using mass spectrometry under native conditions, we show that PRMT6 dimer binds two cofactor and a single H4 peptide molecules. Finally, we characterized a new site of in vitro automethylation of mouse PRMT6 at position 7.

"The peripheral blood of an acute myelomonocytic leukemia patient has been cultured for 16 months. The culture is at present at the 140th population doupling level. The cultured cells have the characteristics of so-called lymphoblastoid cells and proliferate actively as individual cells in small clusters, or in large clumps consisting of large mononuclear cells. Some of these cells appeare to be lymphoid, but the majority are immature mononuclear cells with a tendency to lobulate. They gave a weakly positive peroxidase reaction at the beginning of cultivation, and have given a strongly positive esterase reaction persistently. The cytoplasm shows ciliary or tail-like projections as the cell matures. Complement (C3) receptor and IgG receptors are found on the cell surface, and active phagocytosis is mannifest. Colloidal iron particles or viable red blood cells attached to the cell membrane suggesting possible differentiation to reticulum cells or macrophages. The cultured cells are mostly diploid but some cells show chromosome abnormality. Herpes type virus was foun in the nucleus, cytoplasma and on the cell membrane. The transplanatation of cultured cells to the cheek pouch of hamsters produced small tumors with histological findings resembling reticulum cell sarcoma.

"The main advantage of animal models of infectious diseases over in vitro studies is the gain in the understanding of the complex dynamics between the immune system and the pathogen. While small animal models have practical advantages over large animal models, it is crucial to be aware of their limitations. Although the small animal model at least needs to be susceptible to the pathogen under study to obtain meaningful data, key elements of pathogenesis should also be reflected when compared to humans. Well-designed small animal models for HIV, hepatitis viruses and tuberculosis require, additionally, a thorough understanding of the similarities and differences in the immune responses between humans and small animals and should incorporate that knowledge into the goals of the study. To discuss these considerations, the NIAID hosted a workshop on 'Small Animal Models for HIV, Hepatitis B, and Tuberculosis' on May 30, 2019. Highlights of the workshop are outlined below.

"Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), naturally harboured and shed by bank voles (Myodes [Clethrionomys] glareolus), is the etiological agent to nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Both host and virus are found throughout much of the European continent and in northern Sweden NE is the second most prevalent serious febrile viral infection after influenza. The reliability of diagnostics by PCR depends on genetic variability for the detection of viral nucleic acids in unknown samples. In the present study we evaluated the genetic variability of PUUV isolated from bank voles in an area of northern Sweden highly endemic for NE. Genetic variability among bank voles was also investigated to evaluate co-evolutionary patterns. We found that the viral sequence appeared stable across the 80km study region, with the exception of the southernmost sampling site, which differed from its nearest neighbour by 7%, despite a geographical separation of only 10km. The southernmost sampling site demonstrated a higher degree of genetic similarity to PUUV previously isolated 100km south thereof; two locations appear to constitute a separate PUUV phylogenetic branch. In contrast to the viral genome, no phylogenetic variance was observed in the bank vole mtDNA in this study. Previous studies have shown that as a result of terrestrial mammals' postglacial re-colonization routes, bank voles and associated PUUV of a southern and a northern lineage established a dichotomous contact zone across the Scandinavian peninsula approximately 100-150km south of the present study sites. Our observations reveal evolutionary divergence of PUUV that has led to dissimilarities within the restricted geographical scale of the northern host re-colonization route as well. These results suggest either a static situation in which PUUV strains are regionally well adapted, or an ongoing process in which strains of PUUV circulate on a geographical scale not yet reliably described.

"Although recent advances in sequencing and computational analyses have facilitated use of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) for deciphering coevolution among retroviruses and their hosts, sampling effects from different host populations present major challenges. Here we utilize available whole-genome data from wild and domesticated European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus sp.) populations, sequenced as DNA pools by paired-end Illumina technology, for identifying segregating reference as well as nonreference ERV loci, to reveal their variation along the host phylogeny and domestication history. To produce new viruses, retroviruses must insert a proviral DNA copy into the host nuclear DNA. Occasional proviral insertions into the host germline have been passed down through generations as inherited ERVs during millions of years. These ERVs represent retroviruses that were active at the time of infection and thus present a remarkable record of historical virus-host associations. To examine segregating ERVs in host populations, we apply a reference library search strategy for anchoring ERV-associated short-sequence read pairs from pooled whole-genome sequences to reference genome assembly positions. We show that most ERVs segregate along host phylogeny but also uncover radiation of some ERVs, identified as segregating loci among wild and domestic rabbits. The study targets pertinent issues regarding genome sampling when examining virus-host evolution from the genomic ERV record and offers improved scope regarding common strategies for single-nucleotide variant analyses in host population comparative genomics.

"A new, widespread and important disease of rabbits, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD), is concisely reviewed and discussed. RHD is an acute, infectious condition of adult rabbits and morbidity and mortality, after a relatively short incubation period, can be very high. The disease appears typically as a necrotizing hepatitis with associated haemorrhaging, and death occurs as a result of generalized organ dysfunction. RHD is caused by a calicivirus, antigenically related to a similar virus found in brown hares but distinct from other known caliciviruses, and is spread to susceptible rabbits by a number of routes and vectors. The disease is easily identified and can be effectively controlled in commercial and domestic rabbit populations by slaughter and vaccination regimes. The occurrence of pre-existing cross-reacting antibody in a proportion of rabbits unchallenged by the disease implies the presence of non-pathogenic strains of the virus. This antibody protects against disease on subsequent exposure to RHD. Uniquely, pre-existing antibody does not occur in rabbits in Australia where, after accidental release, the virus is currently spreading rapidly.

"Prevalence of dengue transmission has been alarmed by an estimate of 390 million infections per annum. Urban encroachment, ecological disruption and poor sanitation are all contributory factors of increased epidemiology. Complication however arises from the fact that dengue virus inherently exists as four different serotypes. Secondary infection is often manifested in the more severe form, such that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) could aggravate ailment by allowing pre-existing antibodies to form complexes with infecting viruses as means of intrusion. Consequently, increased viraemic titter and suppression of antiviral response are observed. Deep concerns are thus expressed in regards to escalating trend of hospitalisation and mortality rates. In Malaysia, situation is exacerbated by improper clinical management and pending vector control operations. As a preparedness strategy against the potential deadly dengue pandemic, the call for development of a durable and cost-effective dengue vaccine against all infecting serotypes is intensified. Even though several vaccine candidates are currently being evaluated in clinical trials, uncertainties in regards to serotypes interference, incomplete protection and dose adequacy have been raised. Instead of sole reliance on outsourcing, production of local vaccine should be considered in coherent to government's efforts to combat against dengue.

"Puumala is the most common hantavirus serotype in Europe and is spread mainly by the red bank vole. Between 1 July 1992 and 31 January 1994, an outbreak of Puumala virus-induced nephropathia epidemica (NE) occurred in the Belgian Ardennes. Serologically confirmed cases (n = 41) were compared with two groups of asymptomatic seronegative controls. Risks identified included sighting of living rodents, exposure to rodent droppings, and trapping rodents during the 4 weeks preceding onset of symptoms. Activities during this 4-week period that presented the greatest risk were woodcutting, reopening of a nonaerated room, and strenuous physical effort. This is the first case-control study on risk factors for NE in Europe. In comparison with the American form of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is spread by deer mice, professional activity appears to be a more important risk factor for acquisition of hantavirus in Europe.

"Chikungunya (CHIK) virus is a member of the genus Alphavirus in the family TOGAVIRIDAE: Serologically, it is most closely related to o'nyong-nyong (ONN) virus and is a member of the Semliki Forest antigenic complex. CHIK virus is believed to be enzootic throughout much of Africa and historical evidence indicates that it spread to other parts of the world from this origin. Strains from Africa and Asia are reported to differ biologically, indicating that distinct lineages may exist. To examine the relatedness of CHIK and ONN viruses using genetic data, we conducted phylogenetic studies on isolates obtained throughout Africa and Southeast Asia. Analyses revealed that ONN virus is indeed distinct from CHIK viruses, and these viruses probably diverged thousands of years ago. Two distinct CHIK virus lineages were delineated, one containing all isolates from western Africa and the second comprising all southern and East African strains, as well as isolates from Asia. Phylogenetic trees corroborated historical evidence that CHIK virus originated in Africa and subsequently was introduced into Asia. Within the eastern Africa and southern Africa/Asia lineage, Asian strains grouped together in a genotype distinct from the African groups. These different geographical genotypes exhibit differences in their transmission cycles: in Asia, the virus appears to be maintained in an urban cycle with Aedes aegypti mosquito vectors, while CHIK virus transmission in Africa involves a sylvatic cycle, primarily with AE: furcifer and AE: africanus mosquitoes.

"Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is a common method to identify and to isolate subpopulations within a complex mixture of cells based on their light scatter and fluorescent staining profiles. FACS is widely used to enrich for normal tissue and tumor cells that have stem cell potential. Whereas FACS protocols using conventional breast cancer cell lines are relatively routine, additional technical challenges are encountered when sorting for cell populations from freshly digested solid tumors, particularly for use in downstream cancer stem cell (CSC) assays. First, it is more difficult to isolate live, single cells from whole tumors, and second, single tumor cells prepared from enzymatically digested tumors are typically more sensitive to cell death following the physical stresses of digestion, pipetting, and sorting. Herein methods are described that have been optimized to harvest and to FACS profile viable tumor epithelial cells digested from late-stage mammary tumors originating in the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-polyomavirus middle T antigen (PyMT) transgenic mouse. Protocols were designed to enrich for single, viable, MMTV-PyMT tumor cell populations sorted by FACS and to facilitate the collection of sorted cell subpopulations suitable for head-to-head comparison of CSC activity by tumorsphere assays in vitro or limiting dilution transplantation in vivo.

"We developed several monoclonal antibodies that recognized germinated and nongerminated spores and other developmental stages of Nosema locustae, a pathogen of grasshoppers, by using spore homogenate as antigen. The hybridomas were produced with standard techniques. Indirect fluorescence assay demonstrated recognition by several antibodies to the spore and extruded polar filament. Monoclonal antibody D10-9-11 recognized the spore wall in smears and frozen sections of infected grasshopper fat body tissue, whereas monoclonal antibody D55-12 also labeled the extruded polar filament. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that monoclonal antibody D10-9-11 recognized the spore and several developmental stages. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that monoclonal antibody D10-9-11 did not cross-react with immunogen prepared from other grasshopper pathogens, including Vairimorpha sp., Malameba locustae, and entomopox virus from migratory grasshoppers, Melanoplus sanguinipes (F.).

"BACKGROUND: Noroviruses are the leading cause of viral acute gastroenteritis in humans, noted for causing epidemic outbreaks in communities, the military, cruise ships, hospitals, and assisted living communities. The evolutionary mechanisms governing the persistence and emergence of new norovirus strains in human populations are unknown. Primarily organized by sequence homology into two major human genogroups defined by multiple genoclusters, the majority of norovirus outbreaks are caused by viruses from the GII.4 genocluster, which was first recognized as the major epidemic strain in the mid-1990s. Previous studies by our laboratory and others indicate that some noroviruses readily infect individuals who carry a gene encoding a functional alpha-1,2-fucosyltransferase (FUT2) and are designated ""secretor-positive"" to indicate that they express ABH histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), a highly heterogeneous group of related carbohydrates on mucosal surfaces. Individuals with defects in the FUT2 gene are termed secretor-negative, do not express the appropriate HBGA necessary for docking, and are resistant to Norwalk infection. These data argue that FUT2 and other genes encoding enzymes that regulate processing of the HBGA carbohydrates function as susceptibility alleles. However, secretor-negative individuals can be infected with other norovirus strains, and reinfection with the GII.4 strains is common in human populations. In this article, we analyze molecular mechanisms governing GII.4 epidemiology, susceptibility, and persistence in human populations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Phylogenetic analyses of the GII.4 capsid sequences suggested an epochal evolution over the last 20 y with periods of stasis followed by rapid evolution of novel epidemic strains. The epidemic strains show a linear relationship in time, whereby serial replacements emerge from the previous cluster. Five major evolutionary clusters were identified, and representative ORF2 capsid genes for each cluster were expressed as virus-like particles (VLPs). Using salivary and carbohydrate-binding assays, we showed that GII.4 VLP-carbohydrate ligand binding patterns have changed over time and include carbohydrates regulated by the human FUT2 and FUT3 pathways, suggesting that strain sensitivity to human susceptibility alleles will vary. Variation in surface-exposed residues and in residues that surround the fucose ligand interaction domain suggests that antigenic drift may promote GII.4 persistence in human populations. Evidence supporting antigenic drift was obtained by measuring the antigenic relatedness of GII.4 VLPs using murine and human sera and demonstrating strain-specific serologic and carbohydrate-binding blockade responses. These data suggest that the GII.4 noroviruses persist by altering their HBGA carbohydrate-binding targets over time, which not only allows for escape from highly penetrant host susceptibility alleles, but simultaneously allows for immune-driven selection in the receptor-binding region to facilitate escape from protective herd immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the surface-exposed carbohydrate ligand binding domain in the norovirus capsid is under heavy immune selection and likely evolves by antigenic drift in the face of human herd immunity. Variation in the capsid carbohydrate-binding domain is tolerated because of the large repertoire of similar, yet distinct HBGA carbohydrate receptors available on mucosal surfaces that could interface with the remodeled architecture of the capsid ligand-binding pocket. The continuing evolution of new replacement strains suggests that, as with influenza viruses, vaccines could be targeted that protect against norovirus infections, and that continued epidemiologic surveillance and reformulations of norovirus vaccines will be essential in the control of future outbreaks.

"Enterovirus 71 (EV71), the etiologic agent causes outbreaks with significant mortality in young children in Asia and currently there is no vaccine available. In this study, we report a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Q-ELISA) to determine the concentration of the EV71 VP2 antigen. EV71 virus-like particles (VLPs) were produced in the baculovirus expression system and used as the EV71 antigen reference standard. Antisera from both EV71-immunized chickens and rabbits were very efficient and useful as capture antibodies to bind various forms of EV71 antigens, whereas a commercial VP2-specific virus neutralizing monoclonal antibody MAB979 was found to be suitable for quantifying the amount of VP2 antigen. This Q-ELISA was used successfully to determine VP2 content at each stage of EV71 vaccine manufacturing process, particularly during the upstream harvest, downstream purification and viral inactivation steps. The amount of VP2 antigen and the magnitude of neutralizing titers were found to be dose-dependent in mice immunized with vaccine candidates. These results indicate that Q-ELISA could provide off-line timely quantitative measurements of VP2 antigen throughout the production cycle to evaluate critical attributes and conditions that may affect virus yields in culture media, the quality of purification methods, the stability and potency of final vaccine formulations.

"Antitubulin antibody was used as an immunofluorescent and immunoelectron microscopic probe to localize tubulin in components of the mitotic apparatus of rat kangaroo (strain PtK1) cells in vitro. In addition to the detection of tubulin in the spindle microtubules and centrioles, other structures were found to display specific staining including kinetochores, amorphous pericentriolar material and small virus-like particles associated with the centrioles. The kinetochores consisted of a densely stained outer layer about 400 A thick which is separated from an inner layer of the same dimension by a lightly staining middle layer. Microtubules were primarily associated with the outermost plate of the kinetochore but tubulin was uniformly distributed in both outer and inner plates. Colcemid treatment prevented the assembly of spindle microtubules and resulted in specific alterations of the kinetochore but failed to diminish the staining of the kinetochores. These observations suggest that tubulin molecules may comprise an important structural component of the kinetochore.

"It is widely accepted that adenoviral E1A exerts its influence on recipient cells through binding to the retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins, followed by a global release of E2F factors from pocket-protein control. Our study challenges this simple paradigm by demonstrating previously unappreciated complexity. We show that E1A-expressing primary and transformed cells are characterized by the persistence of Rb-E2F1 complexes. We provide evidence that E1A causes Rb stabilization by interfering with its proteasomal degradation. Functional experiments supported by biochemical data reveal not only a dramatic increase in Rb and E2F1 protein levels in E1A-expressing cells but also demonstrate their activation throughout the cell cycle. We further show that E1A activates an Rb- and E2F1-dependent S-phase checkpoint that attenuates the growth of cells that became hyperploid through errors in mitosis and supports the fidelity DNA replication even in the absence of E2F complexes with other Rb family proteins, thereby functionally substituting for the loss of p53. Our results support the essential role of Rb and E2F1 in the regulation of genomic stability and DNA damage checkpoints.

"The sizes of hyaluronate-containing coats on the surfaces of parent and virus-transformed cell lines (3T3 vs. SV-3T3; BHK vs. PY-BHK) were compared according to the method of Clarris and Fraser (1968, Exp. Cell Res., 49: 181-193) in which fixed red blood cells were allowed to settle slowly on the surface of culture dishes containing the cells. The coats were seen as areas devoid of red blood cells surrounding each of the cultured cells and could be destroyed by the addition of small amounts of streptomyces hyaluronidase, an enzyme specific for hyaluronate. In the case of the parent cell lines (3T3 and BHK), the coats were clearly visible, whereas for their virus-transformed counterparts (SV-3T3 and PY-BHK), the coats were either greatly reduced or absent. To confirm these observations, the amount of hyaluronate associated with each of the cell lines was measured using a direct chemical assay and shown to be significantly greater for the parent cell lines than for their virus-transformed counterparts. In addition, the parent cell lines secreted greater amounts of hyaluronate into the medium and retained a larger fraction of the total amount of hyaluronate at the cell surface than the virus-transformed cells. Thus the larger amount of hyaluronate on the surfaces of the parent cell types may be the result of both a faster rate of production and a decreased rate of release.

"Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is abundantly expressed in the hypothalamus and contributes to hypothalamic functions, including appetite regulation. Although food intake is suggested to be decreased in PACAP (-/-) mice, the detailed mechanisms are still being discussed. We sought to investigate this link. The food consumption at 8 h after refeeding in the (-/-) mice who had fasted for 2 days was significantly lower than in the PACAP (+/+) mice. The nocturnal and daily food intake of (-/-) mice was significantly lower than those of (+/+) mice, but the diurnal food intake showed a tendency to increase. mRNA expression levels of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) were decreased, but those of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) were increased in the hypothalamus of (-/-) mice 4 h after refeeding. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular administration of a PACAP receptor antagonist, PACAP(6-38) (1 nmol/4 μL/mouse), decreased food intake and body weight 1, 2, and 4 h after refeeding, as well as expression levels of AgRP at 4 h after refeeding in (+/+) mice. The selective overexpression of PACAP by the infection of an adeno-associated virus in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) resulted in an increase in food intake and AgRP expression in the nocturnal period in addition to the increased food intake at 8 h after refeeding. These results suggest that food intake behavior in mice is triggered by the increase in PACAP expression in the VMH via modulation of AgRP expression in the hypothalamus, pointing to PACAP inhibition as a potential strategy for the development of anti-obesity drugs.

"A large number of Bartonella species and genetic variants were compared for their ability to cause bacteremia in different rodent species: the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), BALB/c mouse and Wistar rat. Experimental data supported field observations that host specificity can occur among certain Bartonella species and rodent species. Bacteremia could only be readily produced in cotton rats or white-footed mice if the strains used for inoculation were originally obtained from the same species or from a phylogenetically close species. A few Bartonella colonies could be observed in the blood of some BALB/c mice by 7 days after inoculation, but no evidence of the persistence of the infection was found. Host specificity suggests the possibility of a long co-speciation of Bartonella species with their rodent hosts. Host-parasite relationships measured by the duration and level of bacteremia and the minimal infectious dose may serve as additional criteria for classification of Bartonella isolates obtained from natural environments.

"Permissiveness of the host cell to productive infection by oncoretroviruses is cell-cycle dependent, and nuclear localization of viral nucleoprotein preintegration complexes will occur only after cells have passed through mitosis. In contrast, establishment of an integrated provirus after infection by the lentivirus HIV-1 is independent of host cell proliferation. The ability of HIV-1 to replicate in non-dividing cells is partly accounted for by the karyophilic properties of the viral preintegration complex which, after virus infection, is actively transported to the host cell nucleus. Here we report that the gag matrix protein of HIV-1 contains a nuclear localization sequence which, when conjugated to a heterologous protein, directs its nuclear import. In addition, HIV-1 mutants containing amino-acid substitutions in this nuclear localization signal integrate and replicate within dividing but not growth-arrested cells, and thus display a phenotype more representative of an oncoretrovirus.

"BACKGROUND: Annual seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) is recommended for people with diabetes, but their SIV rates remain far below public health targets. We aimed to identify temporal trajectories of SIV uptake over a 10-year period among French people with diabetes and describe their clinical characteristics. METHODS: We identified patients with diabetes in 2006 among a permanent, representative sample of beneficiaries of the French National Health Insurance Fund. We followed them up over 10 seasons (2005/06-2015/16), using SIV reimbursement claims and group-based trajectory modelling to identify SIV trajectories and to study sociodemographic, clinical, and healthcare utilization characteristics associated with the trajectories. RESULTS: We identified six trajectories. Of the 15,766 patients included in the model, 4344 (28%) belonged to the ""continuously vaccinated"" trajectory and 4728 (30%) to the ""never vaccinated"" one. Two other trajectories showed a ""progressive decrease"" (2832, 18%) or sharp ""postpandemic decrease"" (1627, 10%) in uptake. The last two trajectories (totalling 2235 patients, 14%) showed an early or delayed ""increase"" in uptake. Compared to ""continuously vaccinated"" patients, those in the ""progressively decreasing"" trajectory were older and those in all other trajectories were younger with fewer comorbidities at inclusion. Worsening diabetes and comorbidities during follow-up were associated with the ""increasing"" trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with diabetes had been continuously vaccinated or never vaccinated and thus had stable SIV behaviours. Others adopted or abandoned SIV. These behaviour shifts might be due to increasing age, health events, or contextual factors (e.g., controversies about vaccine safety or efficacy). Healthcare professionals and stakeholders should develop tailored strategies that take each group's specificities into account.

"The lack of safe and effective delivery vectors continues to be a critical limitation facing human gene therapy. Viruses offer excellent efficiency but can be difficult and expensive to produce and purify. For example, the production and efficiency of murine leukemia virus (MLV) are limited by its inherent instability; the half-life of infectivity is 5-8 hours at 37 degrees C. In order to generate a stable MLV, we randomly mutated the virus genome and selected for infectivity after prolonged incubation at 37 degrees C. After seven rounds of incubation and infection, we isolated a pool of MLV variants with double the half-life of wild-type MLV. Remarkably, a single mutation in the viral protease (PR), G119E, was responsible for the enhanced stability. Saturation mutagenesis at residue 119 revealed variants with half-lives of approximately 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Double mutants combining the changes at position 119 of the PR and substitutions in the PR substrate-binding pocket exhibited half-lives of up to approximately 40 hours. MLV variants provided two- to fourfold higher viral titers and exhibited increased stability with various wild-type envelope proteins. The improved stability of the variant MLVs will provide more facile virus production and increased transduction efficiency.

"Human papillomavirus testing is becoming an integral component of cervical cancer screening. Market forces will require most laboratories that perform Papanicolaou tests to develop a system for handling human papillomavirus testing also. Data and information are presented that may facilitate laboratories when addressing the following issues in the process of developing a human papillomavirus testing service: Which methodology is the best fit for the laboratory? Is it better to develop an in-house testing service or to send it out? How do I get started? What are the financial and economic issues, and how should they be managed?

"Herpes zoster, the latent descendent of the varicella zoster virus, commonly is seen in clinical practice. Healthcare providers must recognize and treat the virus to decrease the incidence of postherpetic neuralgic pain syndrome. Treatment with an antiviral medication regimen should be initiated rapidly for patients who have had lesions for up to 72 hours. Acyclovir has been the treatment of choice for herpes zoster in the past, but newer drugs, such as valacyclovir, a prodrug of acyclovir, and famciclovir, are as effective for treating the virus and have more convenient dosing regimens and decreased incidence of postherpetic neuralgia.

"Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) has been proven effective in inhibiting human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and has significantly improved the health outcomes in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The therapeutic benefits of cART have been challenged because of the toxicity and emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains along with lifelong patient compliance resulting in non-adherence. These issues also hinder the clinical benefits of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), which are one of the vital components of cART for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. In this study, using a computational and structural based drug design approach, we have discovered an effective HIV -1 NNRTI, compound I (Cmpd I) that is very potent in biochemical assays and which targets key residues in the allosteric binding pocket of wild-type (WT)-RT as revealed by structural studies. Furthermore, Cmpd I exhibited very potent antiviral activity in HIV-1 infected T cells, lacked cytotoxicity (therapeutic index >100,000), and no significant off-target effects were noted in pharmacological assays. To address the issue of non-adherence, we developed a long-acting nanoformulation of Cmpd I (Cmpd I-NP) using poly (lactide-coglycolide) (PLGA) particles. The pharmacokinetic studies of free and nanoformulated Cmpd I were carried out in BALB/c mice. Intraperitoneal administration of Cmpd I and Cmpd I-NP in BALB/c mice revealed prolonged serum residence time of 48 h and 30 days, respectively. The observed serum concentrations of Cmpd I in both cases were sufficient to provide >97% inhibition in HIV-1 infected T-cells. The significant antiviral activity along with favorable pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile of Cmpd I, provide compelling and critical support for its further development as an anti-HIV therapeutic agent.

"Natural disasters, infectious disease epidemics, terrorism, and major events like the nuclear incident at Fukushima all pose major potential challenges to public health and security. Events such as the anthrax letters of 2001, Hurricanes Katrina, Irene, and Sandy, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and West Nile virus outbreaks, and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic have demonstrated that public health, emergency management, and national security efforts are interconnected. These and other events have increased the national resolve and the resources committed to improving the national health security infrastructure. However, as fiscal pressures force federal, state, and local governments to examine spending, there is a growing need to demonstrate both what the investment in public health preparedness has bought and where gaps remain in our nation's health security. To address these needs, the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), through a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response (PHPR), is creating an annual measure of health security and preparedness at the national and state levels: the National Health Security Preparedness Index (NHSPI).

"Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the standard of care for a healthcare worker (HCW) accidentally exposed to an HIV infected source person (occupational exposure), but this is not the case for non-occupational exposures. Very few national guidelines exist for the management of non-occupational exposures to HIV in Europe, contrarily to the occupational ones. The administration of non-occupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NONOPEP) for HIV may be justified by: a biological plausibility, the effectiveness of PEP in animal studies and occupational exposures in humans, efficacy in the prevention of mother to child HIV transmission, and cost effectiveness studies. These evidences, the similar risk of HIV transmission for certain non-occupational exposures to occupational ones, and the conflicting information about attitudes and practices among physicians on NONOPEP led to the proposal of these European recommendations. Participant members of the European project on HIV NONOPEP, funded by the European Commission, and acknowledged as experts in bloodborne pathogen transmission and prevention, met from December 2000 to December 2002 at three formal meetings and a two day workshop for a literature review on risk exposure assessment and the development of the European recommendations for the management of HIV NONOPEP. NONOPEP is recommended in unprotected receptive anal sex and needle or syringe exchange when the source person is known as HIV positive or from a population group with high HIV prevalence. Any combination of drugs available for HIV infected patients can be used as PEP and the simplest and least toxic regimens are to be preferred. PEP should be given within 72 hours from the time of exposure, starting as early as possible and lasting four weeks. All patients should receive medical evaluation including HIV antibody tests, drug toxicity monitoring and counseling periodically for at least 6 months after the exposure. NONOPEP seems to be a both feasible and frequent clinical practice in Europe. Recommendations for its management have been achieved by consensus, but some remain controversial, and they should be updated periodically. NONOPEP should never be considered as a primary prevention strategy and the final decision for prescription must be made on the basis of the patient-physician relationship. Finally, a surveillance system for these cases will be useful to monitor NONOPEP practices in Europe.

"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has been increasing by 0.5% per year in the United States. PDAC portends a dismal prognosis and novel therapies are needed. This study describes the generation and characterization of a novel oncolytic chimeric orthopoxvirus for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. METHODS: After chimerization and high-throughput screening, CF33 was chosen from 100 new chimeric orthopoxvirus isolates for its ability to kill pancreatic cancer cells. In vitro cytotoxicity was assayed in six pancreatic cancer cell lines. In vivo efficacy and toxicity were evaluated in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 xenograft models. RESULTS: CF33 caused rapid killing of six pancreatic cancer cells lines in vitro, releasing damage-associated molecular patterns, and regression of PANC-1 injected and non-injected distant xenografts in vivo after a single low intratumoral dose of 10(3) plaque-forming units. Using luciferase imaging, CF33 was noted to preferentially replicate in tumors which corresponds to the low viral titers found in solid organs. CONCLUSION: The low dose of CF33 required to treat pancreatic cancer in this preclinical study may ease the manufacturing and dosing challenges currently facing oncolytic viral therapy.

"In the 1917 article in which Félix d'Hérelle describes his first observations and proposes the name of bacteriophage, he also reports the first use of these viruses to treat bacterial infections, thus giving birth to phage therapy. Soon after antibiotics supplanted bacteriophages. Today, bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics become a growing public health issue worldwide. This situation has revived research aiming at developing the antibacterial activity of bacteriophages to treat patients as well as diseases in animals and plants. In fact, the areas of applications of bacteriophages as antibacterial are widening as current solutions of chemical nature are questioned. This review summarizes the basic principles of therapeutic applications of bacteriophages and presents recent data in areas where commercial exploitation is occurring or about to emerge.

"Bacteriophages have a prominent place in the living world. They participate to our understanding of the living world through three main aspects : (i) the dissection of the most intimist aspects of viral infection molecular mechanisms (molecular biology), (ii) the description and functioning mechanisms of ecosystems (ecology), and (iii) the adaptive dynamics of integrated viral and host-cell populations (evolution). This review looks back at the genesis of these fundamental findings and draws a picture of the most active fields of current research.

"T lymphocytes, regardless of their specificity, are considered key targets for genetic modification in the treatment of inherited or acquired human diseases. In this study, we generated Lewis T cell lines specific for Dark Agouti rat alloantigens and tested the potential of allospecific T lymphocytes as carriers of genes encoding therapeutic proteins in transplantation gene therapy. These allospecific T lymphocytes were successfully, stably transduced with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) by an Mo-MuLV-based retrovirus vector. A novel gene delivery protocol was utilized, resulting in nearly 100% EGFP-expressing T cells. This approach enabled tracking of allospecific transduced T cells in vivo and illustrates their transgene production by fluorometric determination after ex vivo isolation. Quantitation of EGFP transgene expression was used to determine the influence of T cell receptor-specific activation on transgene regulation. A strict positive correlation between activation state and expression level was detected in vitro and in vivo. The activation-induced increase in transgene expression could be blocked by interference with T cell activation signaling pathways by cyclosporin A, anti-CD4 MAb, or CTLA4-Ig. These data provide strong evidence that direct or indirect effects caused by activation-induced transcription factors are crucial in transgene upregulation. Allospecific activation in spleens, lymph nodes, and transplanted grafts can be considered as antigen-specific targeting strategy. This activation might be useful in expressing therapeutic proteins such as TGF-beta or IL-10 specific to these sites. T lymphocyte priming and activation might be prevented or altered by modification of the local microenvironments, thereby exerting a therapeutic influence on acute and chronic graft rejection processes.

"Understanding African swine fever virus (ASFV) transmission is essential for strategies to minimize virus spread during an outbreak. ASFV can survive for extended time periods in animal products, carcasses, and the environment. While the ASFV genome was found in environments around infected farms, data on the virus survival in soil are scarce. We investigated different soil matrices spiked with ASFV-positive blood from infected wild boar to see if ASFV can remain infectious in the soil beneath infected carcasses. As expected, ASFV genome detection was possible over the entire sampling period. Soil pH, structure, and ambient temperature played a role in the stability of infectious ASFV. Infectious ASFV was demonstrated in specimens originating from sterile sand for at least three weeks, from beach sand for up to two weeks, from yard soil for one week, and from swamp soil for three days. The virus was not recovered from two acidic forest soils. All risk mitigation experiments with citric acid or calcium hydroxide resulted in complete inactivation. In conclusion, the stability of infectious ASFV is very low in acidic forest soils but rather high in sandy soils. However, given the high variability, treatment of carcass collection points with disinfectants should be considered.

"With clinical trials ongoing, efficient clinical production of adeno-associated virus (AAV) to treat large numbers of patients remains a challenge. We compared distribution of AAV8 packaged with Factor VIII (FVIII) in cell culture media and lysates on days 3, 5, 6, and 7 post-transfection and found increasing viral production through day 6, with the proportion of viral particles in the media increasing from 76% at day 3 to 94% by day 7. Compared to FVIII, AAV8 packaged with Factor IX and Protective Protein/Cathepsin A vectors demonstrated a greater shift from lysate towards media from day 3 to 6, implying that particle distribution is dependent on recombinant vector. Larger-scale productions showed that the ratio of full-to-empty AAV particles is similar in media and lysate, and that AAV harvested on day 6 post-transfection provides equivalent function in mice compared to AAV harvested on day 3. This demonstrates that AAV8 production can be optimized by prolonging the duration of culture post-transfection, and simplified by allowing harvest of media only, with disposal of cells that contain 10% or less of total vector yield. Additionally, the difference in particle distribution with different expression cassettes implies a recombinant vector-dependent processing mechanism which should be taken into account during process development.

"There has been considerable debate as to whether obesity can act as an accelerator of type 1 diabetes (T1D). We assessed this possibility using transgenic mice (MIP-TF mice) whose ß-cells express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Infecting these mice with EGFP-expressing murine herpes virus-68 (MHV68-EGFP) caused occasional transient elevation in their blood glucose, peri-insulitis, and Th1 responses to EGFP which did not spread to other ß-cell antigens. We hypothesized that obesity-related systemic inflammation and ß-cell stress could exacerbate the MHV68-EGFP-induced ß-cell autoreactivity. We crossed MIP-TF mice with A(vy) mice which develop obesity and provide models of metabolic disease alongside early stage T2D. Unlike their MIP-TF littermates, MHV68-EGFP-infected A(vy)/MIP-TF mice developed moderate intra-insulitis and transient hyperglycemia. MHV68-EGFP infection induced a more pronounced intra-insulitis in older, more obese, A(vy)/MIP-TF mice. Moreover, in MHV68-EGFP-infected A(vy)/MIP-TF mice, Th1 reactivity spread from EGFP to other ß-cell antigens. Thus, the spreading of autoreactivity among ß-cell antigens corresponded with the transition from peri-insulitis to intra-insulitis and occurred in obese A(vy)/MIP-TF mice but not lean MIP-TF mice. These observations are consistent with the notion that obesity-associated systemic inflammation and ß-cell stress lowers the threshold necessary for T cell autoreactivity to spread from EGFP to other ß-cell autoantigens.

"In wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) on an estate in Perthshire, central Scotland, the seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii was 18/548 (3·3%). The wild rabbit could be a T. gondii reservoir and it has potential value as a sentinel of T. gondii in environmental substrates. Toxoplasma gondii was associated with female sex (P < 0·001) and with relatively heavy infections by Eimeria stiedae (P = 0·036). It was not associated with the intensity of coccidial oocysts, the severity of myxomatosis caused by the virus Myxomatosis cuniculi, the intensity of roundworm eggs, the year or season, rabbit age or distance from farm buildings. Coinfections could have been affected by gestational down regulation of type 1 T helper cells. A sudden influx or release of T. gondii oocysts might have occurred. This is the first report of T. gondii in any wild herbivore in Scotland and also the first report of lapine T. gondii as a coinfection with E. stiedae, M. cuniculi and helminths.

"BACKGROUND: Sparing of antiretroviral drug classes could reduce the toxicity and cost of maintenance treatment for HIV infection. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the non-inferiority of efficacy and the safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (r) monotherapy versus a single-tablet regimen of efavirenz, emtricitabine and tenofovir (EFV/FTC/TDF) over 2 years. METHODS: Adults on stable ART with plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load <50 copies/mL for the past 12 months and no documented treatment failure were randomized to receive either lopinavir/r or EFV/FTC/TDF for 2 years. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients without treatment failure at week 96 (viral load <50 copies/mL at week 96, confirmed at week 98), without study treatment discontinuation, a new AIDS-defining illness, or death. RESULTS: In the ITT analysis, the primary endpoint was reached by, respectively, 64% and 71% of patients in the lopinavir/r (n = 98) and EFV/FTC/TDF arms (n = 97), yielding a difference of -6.8% (lower limit of the 95% two-sided CI: -19.9%). Sanger and UltraDeep sequencing showed the occurrence of PI mutations in the lopinavir/r arm (n = 4) and of NNRTI and/or NRTI mutations in the EFV/FTC/TDF arm (n = 2). No unexpected serious clinical events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Lopinavir/r monotherapy cannot be considered non-inferior to EFV/FTC/TDF. PI resistance rarely emerged in the lopinavir/r arm and did not undermine future PI options. Two years of lopinavir/r monotherapy had no deleterious clinical impact when compared with EFV/FTC/TDF.

"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the importance of central hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) expression in the regulation of food intake and body weight in mice to clarify whether intracellular lipolysis in the mammalian hypothalamus plays a role in regulating appetite. METHODS: Using pharmacological and genetic approaches, we investigated the role of HSL in the rodent brain in the regulation of feeding and energy homeostasis under basal conditions during acute stress and high-fat diet feeding. RESULTS: We found that HSL, a key enzyme in the catabolism of cellular lipid stores, is expressed in the appetite-regulating centers in the hypothalamus and is activated by acute stress through a mechanism similar to that observed in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Inhibition of HSL in rodent models by a synthetic ligand, global knockout, or brain-specific deletion of HSL prevents a decrease in food intake normally seen in response to acute stress and is associated with the increased expression of orexigenic peptides neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP). Increased food intake can be reversed by adeno-associated virus-mediated reintroduction of HSL in neurons of the mediobasal hypothalamus. Importantly, metabolic stress induced by a high-fat diet also enhances the hyperphagic phenotype of HSL-deficient mice. Specific deletion of HSL in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) or AgRP neurons reveals that HSL in the VMH plays a role in both acute stress-induced food intake and high-fat diet-induced obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that HSL activity in the mediobasal hypothalamus is involved in the acute reduction in food intake during the acute stress response and sensing of a high-fat diet.

"A direct spectrophotometric assay for determination of the serum bile acid concentration in the woodchuck (Marmota monax) has been validated. The assay relies on the conversion of 3-hydroxy bile acids to 3-oxo bile acids by 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase with concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. Reduction of NAD+ is coupled via a diaphorase catalyst to the formation of a diformazan dye from nitrotetrazolium blue and the diformazan product is measured spectrophotometrically at 540 nm. Interfering endogenous dehydrogenase activity present in woodchuck sera was inactivated with sodium pyruvate. Mean recovery of seven exogenous bile acids added to woodchuck sera was 102.0 +/- 2.2%. Intra-assay precision was determined with ten replicate samples giving a mean +/- standard error of the mean of 1.94 +/- 0.12 micron/L with a coefficient of variation of 3.9%. The mean serum bile acid concentration determined in 33 clinically healthy animals was 5.52 +/- 0.81 micron/L. The serum bile acid concentration increased following surgical ligation of the bile duct from 3.78 +/- 0.58 micron/L to a maximum value of 148.0 +/- 30.7 micron/L and remained increased for the 42 day study period. In woodchucks treated with carbon tetrachloride, the serum bile acid concentration peaked at 16 hours following treatment at 72.7 +/- 29.3 micron/L, and returned to pretreatment concentration within 6 days. The serum bile acid concentration therefore appears to be a sensitive biochemical test of cholestasis and hepatocellular forms of hepatic injury and of potential value in the clinical assessment of hepatic disease associated with woodchuck hepatitis virus infection.

"Antisense oligonucleotides are molecules that are able to inhibit gene expression being therefore potentially active for the treatment of viral infections or cancer. However, because of their poor stability in biological medium and their weak intracellular penetration, colloidal drugs carriers such as nanoparticles were developed for the delivery of oligonucleotides (ODN). ODN associated to nanoparticles were shown to be protected against degradation and to penetrate more easily into different types of cells. As a consequence, nanoparticles were shown to improve the efficiency of ODNs for the inhibition of the proliferation of cells expressing the point mutated Ha-ras gene. In vivo, polyalkylcyanoacrylate (PACA) nanoparticles were able to efficiently distribute the ODNs to the liver whereas the alginate nanosponges could concentrate the ODNs in the lungs. Finally, ODN loaded to PACA nanoparticles were able to improve in mice, the treatment of RAS cells expressing the point mutated Ha-ras gene.

"European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been exposed to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) and myxoma virus (MYXV) in their native and invasive ranges for decades. Yet, the long-term effects of these viruses on rabbit population dynamics remain poorly understood. In this context, we analysed 17 years of detailed capture-mark-recapture data (2000-2016) from Turretfield, South Australia, using a probabilistic state-space hierarchical modelling framework to estimate rabbit survival and epidemiological dynamics. While RHDV infection and disease-induced death were most prominent during annual epidemics in winter and spring, we found evidence for continuous infection of susceptible individuals with RHDV throughout the year. RHDV-susceptible rabbits had, on average, 25% lower monthly survival rates compared to immune individuals, while the average monthly force of infection in winter and spring was ~38%. These combined to result in an average infection-induced mortality rate of 69% in winter and spring. Individuals susceptible to MYXV and immune to RHDV had similar survival probabilities to those having survived infections from both viruses, whereas individuals susceptible to both RHDV and MYXV had higher survival probabilities than those susceptible to RHDV and immune to MYXV. This suggests that MYXV may reduce the future survival rates of individuals that endure initial MYXV infection. There was no evidence for long-term changes in disease-induced mortality and infection rates for either RHDV or MYXV. We conclude that continuous, year-round virus perpetuation (and perhaps heterogeneity in modes of transmission and infectious doses during and after epidemics) acts to reduce the efficiency of RHDV and MYXV as biocontrol agents of rabbits in their invasive range. However, if virulence can be maintained as relatively constant through time, RHDV and MYXV will likely continue realizing strong benefits as biocontrol agents.

"We have compared the EBV-receptor concentration of two originally EBV-negative human B-cell lymphoma lines, after in vitro conversion with the transforming B95-8 or the cytopathic P3HR-1 EB-viral substrain, respectively, into permanent EBV-carrying sublines. Receptors were measured by the quantitative EBV-absorption bioassay of Sairenji and Hinuma (1973). EBV receptor concentration of all P3HR-1 virus-converted sublines was significantly reduced, in comparison with the B95-8 virus-converted sublines. This suggests that cells with a low receptor concentration are more likely to survive the initial infection with the P3HR-1 viral harvest. The results further confirm the biological differences between the two EBV substrains.

"Several immunomodulators were compared for immunomodulatory and antiviral activity in B6C3F1 female mice. Our results demonstrate that murine recombinant gamma interferon (rIFN-G), human recombinant alpha A/D interferon (rIFN-A), ampligen (a polyribonucleotide) and CL246,738 modulate nonspecific immunity and are effective antiviral agents in vivo. Administration of each of these agents 1 day before cell harvest induced high levels of splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity against YAC-1 target cells. rIFN-G was also a potent activator of peritoneal macrophages (M phi), as evidenced by high levels of antitumor activity and changes in ectoenzyme phenotype that is characteristic of tumoricidal M phi. rIFN-A, ampligen and CL246,738 induced moderate to low levels of M phi activation by these criteria. In vivo protection experiments showed that repeated therapeutic treatment with rIFN-A protected mice against i.p. infection with Venezuelan equine encephalitis (an alpha togavirus, VEE), Banzi (a flavivirus) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). Similar treatment with rIFN-G was effective against VEE and HSV-2, but ineffective against Banzi virus. A single prophylactic i.p. dose of ampligen 1 day before virus challenge was very effective against Banzi virus, moderately effective against HSV-2, and ineffective against VEE and Caraparu (a bunyavirus) infection. A single prophylactic oral dose of CL246,738 provided almost complete protection of mice against VEE, Banzi, and HSV-2, and also increased the mean survival time for Caraparu infected mice. Collectively, these results indicate that rIFN-A, r-IFN-G, ampligen and CL246,738 may be useful in prophylactic or early therapeutic treatment of several serious virus infections. Since these agents stimulate NK cells and M phi, their antiviral activity may result, in part, from the alterations they induce in the natural immune system.

"Infectious diseases and their demographic consequences are thought to influence the genetic diversity of populations. In Europe, during the last 50 years, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has suffered two important viral epizootics: myxomatosis and rabbit viral haemorraghic disease (RVHD). Although mortality rates were very high, the impact of these diseases on genetic diversity has never been assessed directly. The subject of this paper is a wild rabbit population in France, which has been studied since the beginning of the 1980s. The first outbreak of RVHD occurred in 1995 and provoked a demographic crash. The population, sampled for the first time in 1982 and 1994, was sampled again at the end of 1996 to examine the impact of the epizootic on genetic diversity. In spite of the observed high mortality rate ( approximately 90%), analysis of 14 polymorphic loci (allozymes and microsatellites) showed no loss in genetic diversity after the epizootic. Determination of temporal changes in allele frequencies indicated that the population evolved under genetic drift. The temporal method of Waples demonstrated a significant decrease in the effective population size (Ne) correlated with the demographic crash due to the epizootic. However, the population had only been studied for two generations after the epizootic and the remnant population size probably stayed high enough ( approximately 50 individuals) to keep its genetic diversity at the precrash level. These results suggest that, contrary to what is usually thought and in spite of the subsequent high mortality rates, past epizootics (especially myxomatosis) may have had little effect on the genetic diversity of wild rabbit populations in Europe.

"The possibility of using variable domain heavy-chain antibodies (VHH antibodies) as diagnostic tools for dengue virus (DENV) type 2 NS1 protein was investigated and compared with the use of conventional monoclonal antibodies. After successful expression of DENV type 2 NS1 protein, the genes of VHH antibodies against NS1 protein were biopanned from a non-immune llama library by phage display. VHH antibodies were then expressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Simultaneously, monoclonal antibodies were obtained by the conventional route. Sequence analysis of the VHH antibodies revealed novel and long complementarity determining regions 3 (CDR3). Epitope mapping was performed via a phage display peptide library using purified VHH and monoclonal antibodies as targets. Interestingly, the same region of NS1, which comprises amino acids 224HWPKPHTLW232, was conserved for both kinds of antibodies displaying the consensus motif histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan or tryptophan-proline-tryptophan. The two types of antibodies were used to prepare rapid diagnostic kits based on immunochromatographic assay. The VHH antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit showed better sensitivity and specificity than the monoclonal antibody immobilized rapid diagnostic kit, which might be due to the long CDR3 regions of the VHH antibodies and their ability to bind to the pocket and cleft of the targeted antigen. This demonstrates that VHH antibodies are likely to be an option for developing point-of-care tests against DENV infection.

"Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-α and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to a satisfactory result. Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunotherapies may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence. Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients did not result in effective control of HBV infection, suggesting that new formulations of therapeutic vaccines are needed. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) is a useful preclinical model for developing the new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments with nucleos(t)ide analogues, DNA vaccines, and protein vaccines were tested in the woodchuck model. In this paper we summarize the available data concerning therapeutic immunization and gene therapy using recombinant viral vectors approaches in woodchucks, which show encouraging results. In addition, we present potential innovations in immunomodulatory strategies to be evaluated in this animal model.

"Myxoma virus is a poxvirus responsible for myxomatosis in European Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The entire genome of the myxoma virus has been sequenced, allowing a systemic survey of the functions of a large number of putative pathogenic factors that this virus expresses to subvert the immune and inflammatory pathways of infected rabbit hosts. In Italy, industrial rabbits are mostly vaccinated against myxomatosis using the attenuated myxoma virus strains Borghi or SG33. We have identified genetic markers specific for Borghi or SG33 vaccine strains and established a PCR-based assay that could be used to: (a) rapidly diagnose the presence of myxoma virus in infected organs; (b) discriminate between field strain-infected and vaccinated rabbits and (c) differentiate between Borghi or SG33 vaccine strain.

"This report summarizes epidemiological data on nephropathia epidemica (NE) in the Republic of Tatarstan, Russia. NE cases identified in the period 1997-2013 were investigated in parallel with the hantavirus antigen prevalence in small rodents in the study area. A total of 13 930 NE cases were documented in all but one district of Tatarstan, with most cases located in the central and southeastern districts. The NE annual incidence rate exhibited a cyclical pattern, with the highest numbers of cases being registered once in every 3-5 years. The numbers of NE cases rose gradually from July to November, with the highest morbidity in adult males. The highest annual disease incidence rate, 64·4 cases/100 000 population, was observed in 1997, with a total of 2431 NE cases registered. NE cases were mostly associated with visiting forests and agricultural activities. The analysis revealed that the bank vole Myodes glareolus not only comprises the majority of the small rodent communities in the region, but also consistently displays the highest hantavirus prevalence compared to other small rodent species.

"There is a tremendous focus on the application of nanomaterials for the treatment of cancer. Nonprimate models are conventionally used to assess the biomedical utility of nanomaterials. However, these animals often lack an intact immunological background, and the tumors in these animals do not develop spontaneously. We introduce a preclinical woodchuck hepatitis virus-induced liver cancer model as a platform for nanoparticle (NP)-based in vivo experiments. Liver cancer development in these out-bred animals occurs as a result of persistent viral infection, mimicking human hepatitis B virus-induced HCC development. We highlight how this model addresses key gaps associated with other commonly used tumor models. We employed this model to (1) track organ biodistribution of gold NPs after intravenous administration, (2) examine their subcellular localization in the liver, (3) determine clearance kinetics, and (4) characterize the identity of hepatic macrophages that take up NPs using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that the liver and spleen were the primary sites of NP accumulation. Subcellular analyses revealed accumulation of NPs in the lysosomes of CD14(+) cells. Through RNA-seq, we uncovered that immunosuppressive macrophages within the woodchuck liver are the major cell type that take up injected NPs. The woodchuck-HCC model has the potential to be an invaluable tool to examine NP-based immune modifiers that promote host anti-tumor immunity.

"Blood group systems were the first phenotypic markers used in anthropology to decipher the origin of populations, their migratory movements, and their admixture. The recent emergence of new technologies based on the decoding of nucleic acids from an individual's entire genome has relegated them to their primary application, blood transfusion. Thus, despite the finer mapping of the modern human genome in relation to Neanderthal and Denisova populations, little is known about red cell blood groups in these archaic populations. Here we analyze the available high-quality sequences of three Neanderthals and one Denisovan individuals for 7 blood group systems that are used today in transfusion (ABO including H/Se, Rh (Rhesus), Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNS, Diego). We show that Neanderthal and Denisova were polymorphic for ABO and shared blood group alleles recurrent in modern Sub-Saharan populations. Furthermore, we found ABO-related alleles currently preventing from viral gut infection and Neanderthal RHD and RHCE alleles nowadays associated with a high risk of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Such a common blood group pattern across time and space is coherent with a Neanderthal population of low genetic diversity exposed to low reproductive success and with their inevitable demise. Lastly, we connect a Neanderthal RHD allele to two present-day Aboriginal Australian and Papuan, suggesting that a segment of archaic genome was introgressed in this gene in non-Eurasian populations. While contributing to both the origin and late evolutionary history of Neanderthal and Denisova, our results further illustrate that blood group systems are a relevant piece of the puzzle helping to decipher it.

"WIN 54954 (5-[5-[2,6-dichloro-4-(4,5-dihydro-2-oxazolyl)phenoxy]pentyl]-3- methylisoxazole) is a new member of the class of broad-spectrum antipicornavirus compounds known to bind in a hydrophobic pocket within virion capsid protein VP1. In plaque reduction assays, WIN 54954 reduced plaque formation of 50 of 52 rhinovirus serotypes (MICs ranged from 0.007 to 2.2 micrograms/ml). A concentration of 0.28 microgram/ml was effective in inhibiting 80% of the 52 serotypes tested (EC80). WIN 54954 was also effective in inhibiting 15 commonly isolated enteroviruses, with an EC80 of 0.06 microgram/ml. Furthermore, WIN 54954 was effective in reducing the yield of two selected enteroviruses in cell culture by 90% at concentrations approximately equal to their MICs. The therapeutic efficacy of intragastrically administered WIN 54954 was assessed in suckling mice infected with coxsackievirus A-9 or echovirus type 9 (Barty) 2.5 days prior to initiation of therapy. Single daily doses of 2 and 100 mg/kg protected 50% of the mice from developing paralysis (PD50) following infection with coxsackievirus A-9 and echovirus-9, respectively. At the PD50 doses for these two viruses, levels of WIN 54954 in serum were maintained above the in vitro MICs for a significant portion of the dosing interval. The dose-dependent reduction in viral titers observed in coxsackievirus A-9-infected mice correlated well with the therapeutic dose response. The potency and spectrum of WIN 54954 make it a potentially useful compound for the treatment of human enterovirus and rhinovirus infections.

"The possible presence of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) among colonies of Gunnison's prairie dogs, Cynomys gunnisoni Baird, was investigated on or near ranches with histories of vesicular stomatitis (VS) in domestic livestock in the mid-Rio Grande River Valley, NM, and west-slope region of Colorado. Sampling was conducted at six locations, three in each region, using three methods: standard down-draft suction/light traps, up-draft suction/light traps (both supplemented with CO2), and burrow-emergence traps. Two male and four female sand flies, Lutzomyia apache, Young and Perkins were recovered from prairie dog colony and sand-sagebrush association habitats on a cattle ranch in Socorro County, NM. Sand flies were captured only in up-draft suction/light traps. This record is of interest for the following reasons: (1) sand flies have not been reported from the Rio Grande River Valley of New Mexico, (2) sand flies are biological vectors of VS viruses in other areas, (3) the mid-Rio Grande River Valley has been a focus of VS virus activity in domestic livestock during recent outbreaks, and (4) the source of vesicular stomatitis viruses that infect livestock in the western United States is unknown, but may involve introductions of virus from Mexico or an endemic cycle maintained by vector insects.

"Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the hemagglutinin (HA) of the H3 subtype of influenza A virus were grouped according to their inability to bind to particular MAb-selected neutralization escape mutants of the virus having an amino acid substitution in one of the five postulated antigenic sites on the molecule. Additional residues critical to the binding of the MAbs were deduced from their patterns of reactivity with a panel of field strains and receptor mutants of the H3 subtype. The relationship of these residues to the actual epitopes recognized by the MAbs was inferred from their location on the three-dimensional structure of the HA molecule. In this way it was generally possible to identify a number of residues that are critical to the integrity of the epitope recognized by each of the MAbs examined. It was found that: (1) Several of these epitopes appear to be discontinuous and some may depend on residues contributed by more than one monomer. For example, residue 205, in the interface between monomers of the HA, was found to affect the integrity of the epitopes for several MAbs, possibly by stabilizing the conformation of residues around the receptor-binding pocket and/or in site B on the adjacent monomer. The activity of these particular MAbs was greatly decreased if the virus was exposed to pH 5. (2) All the MAbs tested neutralized viral infectivity and inhibited hemagglutination, although the single MAb directed to site C, which is the most distant from the receptor-binding site, was the least efficient. (3) Hemagglutination inhibition, and particularly neutralization tests, were more discriminating than ELISA in discerning subtle differences between the corresponding epitopes recognized by MAbs on different field strains. (4) Efficiency of neutralization of infectivity did not correlate consistently with hemagglutination inhibiting efficiency; MAbs postulated to bind to epitopes close to the receptor-binding pocket were very efficient at inhibiting hemagglutination, whereas neutralization efficiency tended to be more influenced by the affinity of binding of the MAb. (5) A MAb binding to any particular epitope could affect the binding of a second MAb directed to an epitope within the same or even a different antigenic site. The observed effect was most commonly inhibition of binding, which was not always reciprocal; enhancement of binding was also observed with certain combinations of MAbs. The relative affinity of the MAbs, in addition to steric constraints, were shown to be important factors in the ability to compete for interaction with HA.

"An early and essential event in the protective immune response against most viruses and protozoa is the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In contrast, during infection with African trypanosomes, protozoan parasites that cause human sleeping sickness, the increased levels of IFN-gamma do not correlate with a protective response. We showed previously that African trypanosomes express a protein called T lymphocyte triggering factor (TLTF), which triggers CD8(+) T lymphocytes to proliferate and to secrete IFN-gamma. Here, we isolate the gene for TLTF and demonstrate that the recombinant version of TLTF specifically induces CD8(+), but not CD4(+), T cells to secrete IFN-gamma. Studies with TLTF fused to the green fluorescent protein show that TLTF is localized to small vesicles that are found primarily at or near the flagellar pocket, the site of secretion in trypanosomes. TLTF is likely to be only the first example of a class of proteins that we designate as trypanokines, i.e., factors secreted by trypanosomes that modulate the cytokine network of the host immune system for the benefit of the parasite.

"The linkage of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) to the development of oral cancer has been studied. In spite of the presence of viral nucleic acids in some human oral cancer specimens, HSV alone is not carcinogenic in animals: repeated viral inoculation to mouse or hamster oral mucosa fails to produce tumours or histopathological evidence of malignancy. However, HSV demonstrates co-carcinogenicity in vivo: viral inoculation significantly enhances the oncogenic capacity of chemical carcinogens in the oral cavity of mice and hamsters. Though the detailed mechanisms of HSV cocarcinogenicity are unknown, HSV promotes the chemical carcinogen-induced activation of certain cellular proto-oncogenes and inactivation of p53 tumour suppressor gene. Human papillomaviruses type 16 (HPV-16) and 18 (HPV-18) demonstrate oncogenicity by transforming normal human oral keratinocytes in vitro. While normal cells exhibit a limited life-span, cells transformed by these viruses show immortality and altered morphology in comparison with their normal counterparts. The HPV-immortalised cells contain multiple copies of intact viral genome integrated into cellular chromosomes. These cells also express several viral-specific mRNAs including viral E6/E7 mRNAs. Notably, these cells contain low levels of p53 protein and overexpressed cellular myc proto-oncogene compared to their normal counterpart; however, the immortilised cell lines are non-tumorigenic in nude mice.

"Alphaviruses are enveloped viruses with highly organized structures. The nucleocapsid (NC) core contains a capsid protein lattice enclosing the plus-sense RNA genome, and it is surrounded by a lipid bilayer containing a lattice of the E1 and E2 envelope glycoproteins. Capsid protein is synthesized in the cytoplasm and particle budding occurs at the plasma membrane (PM), but the traffic and assembly of viral components and the exit of virions from host cells are not well understood. To visualize the dynamics of capsid protein during infection, we developed a Sindbis virus infectious clone tagged with a tetracysteine motif. Tagged capsid protein could be fluorescently labeled with biarsenical dyes in living cells without effects on virus growth, morphology, or protein distribution. Live cell imaging and colocalization experiments defined distinct groups of capsid foci in infected cells. We observed highly motile internal puncta that colocalized with E2 protein, which may represent the transport machinery that capsid protein uses to reach the PM. Capsid was also found in larger nonmotile internal structures that colocalized with cellular G3BP and viral nsP3. Thus, capsid may play an unforeseen role in these previously observed G3BP-positive foci, such as regulation of cellular stress granules. Capsid puncta were also observed at the PM. These puncta colocalized with E2 and recruited newly synthesized capsid protein; thus, they may be sites of virus assembly and egress. Together, our studies provide the first dynamic views of the alphavirus capsid protein in living cells and a system to define detailed mechanisms during alphavirus infection.

"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the single most important cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants and young children and a major viral agent responsible for respiratory tract disease in immunosuppressed individuals and the elderly, but no vaccines and antiviral drugs are available. Herein the recombinant RSV (rRSV) encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP, rRSV-EGFP) was constructed and the potential for screening anti-RSV drugs was investigated. The recombinant plasmid of pBRATm-rRSV-EGFP, containing T7 transcription cassette composed of T7 promoter, RSV antigenomic cDNA with EGFP gene, HDV ribozyme (δ), and T7 terminator in the order of 5' to 3', was constructed and cotransfected into BHK/T7-9 cells together with helper plasmids encoding N, P, L, and M2-1 gene, respectively. The rescued rRSV-EGFP was confirmed by increasing expression of EGFP over blind passages and by RT-PCR. rRSV-EGFP was comparable to the other two recombinant RSVs encoding red fluorescent protein (RFP, rRSV-RFP) or luciferase (Luc, rRSV-Luc) in the growth kinetic, and there was a difference in sensitivity between them for screening anti-RSV agents based on infection of HEp-2 cells. The EGFP-encoding rRSV has been constructed and rescued successfully and has the potential for high-throughput anti-RSV drug screening in vitro.

"The rabies vaccine is produced by inactivation of rabies virus propagated on BHK21 cells. In the rabies inactivation process, BEI is added at a final concentration of 1.6 mM to the viral harvest at 37 degrees C, followed by a second dose of BEI at 24 h post-inactivation. Inactivation was confirmed by the mice innocuity test and tissue culture amplification test as per B.P (Vet) 2004. Validation of test procedure is essential as per cGMP requirement. The dose of BEI was validated by using lower and higher concentrations of BEI in inactivation process. The study indicated that BEI at a lower concentration (0.4 mM) was able to inactivate the rabies virus within 30 h and the routine concentration (1.6 mM) of BEI is effective in inactivating rabies virus within 18 h. The amplification test used for confirming the inactivation of the live virus was validated by spiking the sample with different dilutions of pretitrated live rabies virus. The test revealed that the amplification method is sensitive to detect live rabies virus if present in the inactivated sample. The validation of BEI as an inactivant and the amplification test are discussed.

"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains dark agouti (DA) to piebald viral glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O(2)(-)), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese O(2)(-) dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), decreased oxidative stress markers 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after 24 h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2 h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. ONOO(-) was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.

"We have constructed a recombinant herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) that simultaneously encodes selected structural proteins from all three virion compartments-capsid, tegument, and envelope-fused with autofluorescent proteins. This triple-fluorescent recombinant, rHSV-RYC, was replication competent, albeit with delayed kinetics, incorporated the fusion proteins into all three virion compartments, and was comparable to wild-type HSV-1 at the ultrastructural level. The VP26 capsid fusion protein (monomeric red fluorescent protein [mRFP]-VP26) was first observed throughout the nucleus and later accumulated in viral replication compartments. In the course of infection, mRFP-VP26 formed small foci in the periphery of the replication compartments that expanded and coalesced over time into much larger foci. The envelope glycoprotein H (gH) fusion protein (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein [EYFP]-gH) was first observed accumulating in a vesicular pattern in the cytoplasm and was then incorporated primarily into the nuclear membrane. The VP16 tegument fusion protein (VP16-enhanced cyan fluorescent protein [ECFP]) was first observed in a diffuse nuclear pattern and then accumulated in viral replication compartments. In addition, it also formed small foci in the periphery of the replication compartments which, however, did not colocalize with the small mRFP-VP26 foci. Later, VP16-ECFP was redistributed out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where it accumulated in vesicular foci and in perinuclear clusters reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus. Late in infection, mRFP-VP26, EYFP-gH, and VP16-ECFP were found colocalizing in dots at the plasma membrane, possibly representing mature progeny virus. In summary, this study provides new insights into the dynamics of compartmentalization and interaction among capsid, tegument, and envelope proteins. Similar strategies can also be applied to assess other dynamic events in the virus life cycle, such as entry and trafficking.

"A method was developed for the production of Eastern equine encephalomyelitis vaccine from virus grown in rolling-bottle cultures (840 cm(2) growth area) of chick embryo cells. The PE-6 strain of virus was propagated in chick embryo cell roller cultures maintained on serum-free medium 199 containing 0.25% human serum albumin and antibiotics (MM). A multiplicity of inoculum of 0.005 yielded acceptable titers of virus at a convenient harvest time of 18 to 24 hr and reduced the carry-over of extraneous material from the virus seed. Growth studies in which 100, 200, or 300 ml of MM was used showed that use of 300 ml of MM offered two advantages: (i) cytopathic effects were less at the 18- to 24-hr harvest time, thereby decreasing cellular material in the final product, and (ii) total virus yield was not substantially reduced, thus permitting large-scale production of virus for further processing. Studies on formalin inactivation at 37 C indicated that the virus was inactivated by 0.05% formalin within 12 to 16 hr and with 0.1% formalin within 6 to 8 hr. Antigen extinction tests in hamsters revealed excellent potency (e.g., median-effective-dose values of 0.069 to 0.012 ml) for both fluid and freeze-dried products. The advantages of the roller-bottle technique in vaccine production are discussed.

"Activation of the BTLA-HVEM co-inhibitory signaling pathway impairs antitumor immunity. Our previous study demonstrated that the extracellular domain of murine BTLA (the soluble form of BTLA) can facilitate HSP70 vaccine-triggered antitumor immunity by blocking BTLA-HVEM interactions in a murine TC-1 non-metastatic tumor model. However, it is unknown whether this strategy has beneficial effects on highly malignant metastatic tumors, such as melanoma. To address this question, we expressed the soluble form of BTLA (sBTLA) in combination with HSP70 vaccine and examined the resulting antitumor activity in a melanoma pulmonary metastasis model. A recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector was used for the sBTLA gene delivery because of its high transfection efficiency and low toxicity. In vitro expression of AAV-sBTLA enhanced lymphocyte activation and induced specific cytotoxicity against B16F1 murine melanoma cells, while in vivo administration of AAV-sBTLA plus HSP70 vaccine by tail vein injection exerted a limited, late-stage antitumor effect against the existing B16F1 cells. However, the combination treatment generated a potent prophylactic antitumor response in the melanoma lung metastasis model in B6 mice. In this case, most of the metastatic foci were inhibited, and mouse survival was prolonged. Furthermore, the Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ were up-regulated, while the negative regulatory molecules IL-10 and TGF-β were down-regulated. The number of regulatory T cells also decreased in the tumor environment. Therefore, AAV-sBTLA plus HSP70 vaccine may have therapeutic potential for the prevention of metastatic melanoma.

"Salmon farming is an important economic activity, and employer, particularly for remoter areas of Scotland; crustacean fisheries are also significant small businesses in these areas. Salmon frames (the head and spine that remain after evisceration and filleting) are sometimes used to bait the creel pots used to catch lobsters and crabs. These frames may contain pathogens that could potentially be spread to salmon farms in the vicinity of creel fisheries. Therefore, an analysis has been carried out for key pathogens of farmed salmon to assess the risks associated with this process. Infection of farms via creel bait requires that: (1) pathogens are present in salmon at harvest; (2) they are not removed from the salmon that used for bait during processing; (3) they transmit from creel pot baits to salmon farms. This last step is critical and leads to most of the uncertainty in results. Risk were assessed for 7 viruses, 3 bacteria, and 3 eukaryotic parasites of importance to salmon farming. A potentially significant risk was identified in association with disease control programmes if fish were filleted at a secondary processor; such a situation should arise only rarely. A very low risk, per event, was identified from imports, however, because of large numbers of Norwegian imports processed in the UK this risk is always present. Risks were at worst of low (disease control) or very low (imports) probability and are significant only because of the magnitude of consequences.

"BACKGROUND: Thelazia callipaeda is a zoonotic nematode that affects the eyes of domestic and wild animals, including dogs, cats and red foxes. This parasitic eye worm is transmitted by Phortica variegata, which is a zoophilic fruit fly spread in Europe. Two wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) found dead in north-eastern Portugal were submitted to necropsy. RESULTS: Both animals presented gross lesions compatible with haemorrhagic viral disease. Eye examination revealed the presence of six worms (three in each animal, on both eyes). Out of the six nematodes, five females and one male were morphologically and molecularly identified as T. callipaeda. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of T. callipaeda in wild rabbits from Portugal, which reveals a new host for this parasite in southern Europe and emphasizes the importance of including thelaziosis in the differential diagnosis of ocular alterations in both animals and humans from areas where the eye worm is endemic.

"CONTEXT: Although life-saving, liver transplantation burdens children with lifelong immunosuppression and substantial potential for morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To establish the feasibility of immunosuppression withdrawal in pediatric living donor liver transplant recipients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective, multicenter, open-label, single-group pilot trial conducted in 20 stable pediatric recipients (11 male; 55%) of parental living donor liver transplants for diseases other than viral hepatitis or an autoimmune disease who underwent immunosuppression withdrawal. Their median age was 6.9 months (interquartile range [IQR], 5.5-9.1 months) at transplant and 8 years 6 months (IQR, 6 years 5 months to 10 years 9 months) at study enrollment. Additional entry requirements included stable allograft function while taking a single immunosuppressive drug and no evidence of acute or chronic rejection or significant fibrosis on liver biopsy. Gradual immunosuppression withdrawal over a minimum of 36 weeks was instituted at 1 of 3 transplant centers between June 5, 2006, and November 18, 2009. Recipients were followed up for a median of 32.9 months (IQR, 1.0-49.9 months). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point was the proportion of operationally tolerant patients, defined as patients who remained off immunosuppression therapy for at least 1 year with normal graft function. Secondary clinical end points included the durability of operational tolerance, and the incidence, timing, severity, and reversibility of rejection. RESULTS: Of 20 pediatric patients, 12 (60%; 95% CI, 36.1%-80.9%) met the primary end point, maintaining normal allograft function for a median of 35.7 months (IQR, 28.1-39.7 months) after discontinuing immunosuppression therapy. Follow-up biopsies obtained more than 2 years after completing withdrawal showed no significant change compared with baseline biopsies. Eight patients did not meet the primary end point secondary to an exclusion criteria violation (n = 1), acute rejection (n = 2), or indeterminate rejection (n = 5). Seven patients were treated with increased or reinitiation of immunosuppression therapy; all returned to baseline allograft function. Patients with operational tolerance compared with patients without operational tolerance initiated immunosuppression withdrawal later after transplantation (median of 100.6 months [IQR, 71.8-123.5] vs 73.0 months [IQR, 57.6-74.9], respectively; P = .03), had less portal inflammation (91.7% [95% CI, 61.5%-99.8%] vs 42.9% [95% CI, 9.9%-81.6%] with no inflammation; P = .04), and had lower total C4d scores on the screening liver biopsy (median of 6.1 [IQR, 5.1-9.3] vs 12.5 [IQR, 9.3-16.8]; P = .03). CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, 60% of pediatric recipients of parental living donor liver transplants remained off immunosuppression therapy for at least 1 year with normal graft function and stable allograft histology.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest malignancies with an overall survival of 5% and is the second cause of death by cancer, mainly linked to its high metastatic aggressiveness. Accordingly, understanding the mechanisms sustaining the PDAC metastatic phenotype remains a priority. In this study, we generated and used a murine in vivo model to select clones from the human Panc-1 PDAC cell line that exhibit a high propensity to seed and metastasize into the liver. We showed that myoferlin, a protein previously reported to be overexpressed in PDAC, is significantly involved in the migratory abilities of the selected cells. We first report that highly metastatic Panc-1 clones expressed a significantly higher myoferlin level than the corresponding low metastatic ones. Using scratch wound and Boyden's chamber assays, we show that cells expressing a high myoferlin level have higher migratory potential than cells characterized by a low myoferlin abundance. Moreover, we demonstrate that myoferlin silencing leads to a migration decrease associated with a reduction of mitochondrial respiration. Since mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation has been shown to be implicated in the tumor progression and dissemination, our data identify myoferlin as a valid potential therapeutic target in PDAC.

"BACKGROUND: Fast-spreading diseases affecting wildlife populations threaten biodiversity. Two caliciviruses, Lagovirus europaeus/GI.1 and Lagovirus europaeus/GI.2, caused rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in wild rabbits. Despite having different characteristics, these variants spread quickly, posing a threat to wild rabbit populations. METHODS: In this study, we conducted a thorough review of the scientific literature and reports of international organisations of first detections of both variants of RHDV in the Euro-Mediterranean region. We concentrated on this area to avoid bias due to intentional human introductions. RESULTS: The estimated mean spread rate of GI.2 was higher than that of GI.1 (GI.2: 479 km/year, range: 47-7346; GI.1: 330 km/year, 37-6248). These differences were not statistically significant. This lack of difference may be due to the interactions between each variant's virulence characteristics. Humans may have a dominant effect on their spread. Potential limitations associated with the observational process could have hindered our ability to identify statistical differences. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of difference in the spread patterns of the two variants could be due to a biological cause, human facilitation or a lack of statistical power. Adapting protocols to detect diseases in wildlife using homogeneous criteria will be indispensable in the coming years.

"In many study systems, populations fluctuate synchronously across large regions. Several mechanisms have been advanced to explain this, but their importance in nature is often uncertain. Theoretical studies suggest that spatial synchrony initiated in one species through Moran effects may propagate among trophically linked species, but evidence for this in nature is lacking. By applying the nonparametric spatial correlation function to time series data, we discover that densities of the gypsy moth, the moth's chief predator (the white-footed mouse), and the mouse's winter food source (red oak acorns) fluctuate synchronously over similar distances (approximately1000 km) and with similar levels of synchrony. In addition, we investigate the importance of consumer-resource interactions in propagating synchrony among species using an empirically informed simulation model of interactions between acorns, the white-footed mouse, the gypsy moth, and a viral pathogen of the gypsy moth. Our results reveal that regional stochasticity acting directly on populations of the mouse, moth, or pathogen likely has little effect on levels of the synchrony displayed by these species. In contrast, synchrony in mast seeding can propagate across trophic levels, thus explaining observed levels of synchrony in both white-footed mouse and gypsy moth populations. This work suggests that the transfer of synchrony among trophically linked species may be a major factor causing interspecific synchrony.

"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene leading to polymerization of the sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and deformation of red blood cells. Autologous transplantation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) genetically modified using lentiviral vectors (LVs) to express an anti-sickling β-globin leads to some clinical benefit in SCD patients, but it requires high-level transgene expression (i.e., high vector copy number [VCN]) to counteract HbS polymerization. Here, we developed therapeutic approaches combining LV-based gene addition and CRISPR-Cas9 strategies aimed to either knock down the sickle β-globin and increase the incorporation of an anti-sickling globin (AS3) in hemoglobin tetramers, or to induce the expression of anti-sickling fetal γ-globins. HSPCs from SCD patients were transduced with LVs expressing AS3 and a guide RNA either targeting the endogenous β-globin gene or regions involved in fetal hemoglobin silencing. Transfection of transduced cells with Cas9 protein resulted in high editing efficiency, elevated levels of anti-sickling hemoglobins, and rescue of the SCD phenotype at a significantly lower VCN compared to the conventional LV-based approach. This versatile platform can improve the efficacy of current gene addition approaches by combining different therapeutic strategies, thus reducing the vector amount required to achieve a therapeutic VCN and the associated genotoxicity risk.

"As current interventions for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) rarely induce cure, more effective drugs are needed. Short-term treatment of woodchucks with the novel immunomodulator AIC649, a parapoxvirus-based stimulator of toll-like receptor 9 dependent and independent pathways, has been shown to reduce viral DNA and surface antigen via a unique, biphasic response pattern. The present study evaluated long-term AIC649 treatment in combination with Entecavir for potency and safety in woodchucks. AIC649 monotreatment induced modest reductions in serum viral DNA and surface and e antigens that were associated with the same biphasic response pattern previously observed. Entecavir monotreatment reduced transiently viremia but not antigenemia, while AIC649/Entecavir combination treatment mediated superior viral control. Undetectability of viral antigens and elicitation of antibodies in AIC649/Entecavir-treated woodchucks correlated with the expression of interferons and suppression of viral replication in liver. Combination treatment was well tolerated, and liver enzyme elevations were minor and transient. It was concluded that the AIC649-mediated effects were most likely based on an improvement and/or reconstitution of antiviral immune responses that are typically deficient in CHB. As a combination partner to Entecavir, the antiviral efficacy of AIC649 was markedly enhanced. This preclinical study supports future evaluation of AIC649 for treatment of human CHB.

"Influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp) does not have capping activity and relies on the capped RNAs produced by the host RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The viral polymerases process the capped RNAs to produce short capped RNA fragments that are used as primers to initiate the transcription of viral mRNAs. This process, known as cap-snatching, can be targeted by antiviral therapeutics. Here, anthralin was identified as an inhibitor against influenza a virus (IAV) infection by targeting the cap-snatching activity of the viral polymerase. Anthralin, an FDA-approved drug used in the treatment of psoriasis, shows antiviral activity against IAV infection in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, anthralin significantly reduces weight loss, lung injury, and mortality caused by IAV infection in mice. The mechanism of action study revealed that anthralin inhibits the cap-binding function of PB2 subunit and endonuclease activity of PA. As a result, viral mRNA transcription is blocked, leading to the decreases in viral RNA replication and viral protein expression. In conclusion, anthralin has been demonstrated to have the potential of an alternative antiviral against influenza virus infection. Also, targeting the captive pocket structure that includes the N-terminus of PA endonuclease domain and the C-terminal of PB2 cap-binding domain of IAV RdRp may be an excellent strategy for developing anti-influenza drugs.

"We constructed a model to predict the potential distribution of Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, the reservoir of Andes virus (Genus: Hantavirus), in Argentina. We developed an extensive database of occurrence records from published studies and our own surveys and compared two methods to model the probability of O. longicaudatus presence; logistic regression and MaxEnt algorithm. The environmental variables used were tree, grass and bare soil cover from MODIS imagery and, altitude and 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim database. The models performances were evaluated and compared both by threshold dependent and independent measures. The best models included tree and grass cover, mean diurnal temperature range, and precipitation of the warmest and coldest seasons. The potential distribution maps for O. longicaudatus predicted the highest occurrence probabilities along the Andes range, from 32°S and narrowing southwards. They also predicted high probabilities for the south-central area of Argentina, reaching the Atlantic coast. The Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome cases coincided with mean occurrence probabilities of 95 and 77% for logistic and MaxEnt models, respectively. HPS transmission zones in Argentine Patagonia matched the areas with the highest probability of presence. Therefore, colilargos presence probability may provide an approximate risk of transmission and act as an early tool to guide control and prevention plans.

"The hepatitis C virus H strain (HCV-H) polyprotein is cleaved to produce at least 10 distinct products, in the order of NH2-C-E1-E2-p7-NS2-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-NS5B -COOH. An HCV-encoded serine proteinase activity in NS3 is required for cleavage at four sites in the nonstructural region (3/4A, 4A/4B, 4B/5A, and 5A/5B). In this report, the HCV-H serine proteinase domain (the N-terminal 181 residues of NS3) was tested for its ability to mediate trans-processing at these four sites. By using an NS3-5B substrate with an inactivated serine proteinase domain, trans-cleavage was observed at all sites except for the 3/4A site. Deletion of the inactive proteinase domain led to efficient trans-processing at the 3/4A site. Smaller NS4A-4B and NS5A-5B substrates were processed efficiently in trans; however, cleavage of an NS4B-5A substrate occurred only when the serine proteinase domain was coexpressed with NS4A. Only the N-terminal 35 amino acids of NS4A were required for this activity. Thus, while NS4A appears to be absolutely required for trans-cleavage at the 4B/5A site, it is not an essential cofactor for serine proteinase activity. To begin to examine the conservation (or divergence) of serine proteinase-substrate interactions during HCV evolution, we demonstrated that similar trans-processing occurred when the proteinase domains and substrates were derived from two different HCV subtypes. These results are encouraging for the development of broadly effective HCV serine proteinase inhibitors as antiviral agents. Finally, the kinetics of processing in the nonstructural region was examined by pulse-chase analysis. NS3-containing precursors were absent, indicating that the 2/3 and 3/4A cleavages occur rapidly. In contrast, processing of the NS4A-5B region appeared to involve multiple pathways, and significant quantities of various polyprotein intermediates were observed. NS5B, the putative RNA polymerase, was found to be significantly less stable than the other mature cleavage products. This instability appeared to be an inherent property of NS5B and did not depend on expression of other viral polypeptides, including the HCV-encoded proteinases.

"The adult cerebellar Purkinje cell is an exceptional neuron in the central nervous system in that it expresses high levels of NMDAR1 (NR1) mRNA without expressing any NMDAR2 (NR2) mRNAs. It has no functional NMDA receptor (NMDAR) channels, although it receives enormous numbers of excitatory inputs. Despite the high level of NR1 mRNA expression, the presence and localization of NR1 protein in mature Purkinje cells are controversial. To examine the presence of NR1 protein and its ability to form functional NMDARs, we expressed the NR2B subunit in rat mature Purkinje neurons by Sindbis viral-mediated gene transfer. The recombinant virus encoding both the NR2B and enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes (designated as SIN-EG-NR2B) infected Purkinje cells without infecting glial cells. GFP fluorescence was detected in the soma and throughout dendrites of Purkinje cells 18-24 h postinfection. In most of GFP-positive cells, the expression of NR2B protein was detected by immunostaining with NR2B-specific antibodies. In Purkinje cells infected with SIN-EG-NR2B, the iontophoretic application of NMDA induced prominent NMDAR-mediated current responses, indicating that the exogenous NR2B was assembled with endogenous NR1 to form functional NMDARs. Furthermore, NMDAR-mediated synaptic currents were detected at both the climbing fibre and parallel fibre synapses in infected Purkinje cells. Thus, the mature Purkinje cell produces NR1 protein that is ready to combine with NR2 to form functional NMDARs in excitatory synapses.

"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a seasonal infection affecting most children by 2 years of age and the leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection requiring hospitalization in infants. Novel antiviral medications are in development to improve the clinical outcomes of RSV; however, no clinical outcome assessments (COAs) for RSV have been developed in alignment with the United States Food and Drug Administration patient-reported outcome guidance to assist in the evaluation of new therapies. To address this need, an observer-reported outcome (ObsRO) measure designed to assess observable RSV symptoms was created. METHODS: The literature was reviewed to evaluate existing COAs and identify constructs of interest. Individual caregiver interviews elicited concepts that informed item development, and candidate items were subsequently evaluated in two rounds of cognitive testing. Separate cohorts of caregivers of RSV-infected nonhospitalized and hospitalized infants participated. Therapeutic-area experts provided input throughout the instrument development process. RESULTS: Caregivers of 39 children < 24 months old with RSV (31 nonhospitalized, 8 hospitalized) participated in in-depth, individual interviews during concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing, resulting in 21 concepts identified as potentially observable and relevant to young children with RSV. The item pool was reduced to 12 cardinal symptoms and behavior impacts reported to be directly observable by caregivers, with 10 daytime and 9 nighttime symptoms to capture diurnal variation in severity. CONCLUSIONS: The RSV Caregiver Diary assesses RSV symptom severity and change from the parent or caregiver perspective in a standardized manner to measure treatment benefit. Following psychometric evaluation and refinement, this tool is expected to be suitable for assisting in the clinical development of RSV therapeutics.

"The need to replace rabies immune globulin (RIG) as an essential component of rabies postexposure prophylaxis is widely acknowledged. We set out to discover a unique combination of human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) able to replace RIG. Stringent criteria concerning neutralizing potency, affinity, breadth of neutralization, and coverage of natural rabies virus (RV) isolates and in vitro escape mutants were set for each individual antibody, and the complementarities of the two MAbs were defined at the onset. First, we identified and characterized one human MAb (CR57) with high in vitro and in vivo neutralizing potency and a broad neutralization spectrum. The linear antibody binding site was mapped on the RV glycoprotein as antigenic site I by characterizing CR57 escape mutants. Secondly, we selected using phage display a complementing antibody (CR4098) that recognized a distinct, nonoverlapping epitope (antigenic site III), showed similar neutralizing potency and breadth as CR57, and neutralized CR57 escape mutants. Reciprocally, CR57 neutralized RV variants escaping CR4098. Analysis of glycoprotein sequences of natural RV isolates revealed that the majority of strains contain both intact epitopes, and the few remaining strains contain at least one of the two. In vitro exposure of RV to the combination of CR57 and CR4098 yielded no escape mutants. In conclusion, a novel combination of human MAbs was discovered suitable to replace RIG.

"Carbohydrate antigens rarely provide target epitopes for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Disialoganglioside GD2 is a glycolipid expressed at high levels in human tumors and a small group of murine lymphomas (EL4, RBL5, RMA, RMA-S, A13, and BALBRVE). Immunization of C57B1/6 mice with irradiated EL4 cells stimulated a specific CTL response and protected these animals from engraftment of EL4 lymphoma. The CTL activity resided in the CD4-CD8+ population, was dependent on T cell receptor alpha/beta, and was not removed by anti-natural killer cell immunoabsorption, but was restricted to GD2 and H-2b bearing targets. CTL activity could be completely inhibited by GD2-oligosaccharide-specific monoclonal antibodies and their F(ab')2 fragments, but not by immunoglobulin G3 myelomas or antibodies against GD3 or GM2. Soluble GD2 did not inhibit specific tumor lysis. RMA-S lymphoma cells (GD2+H-2b-TAP2 deficient) were resistant to GD2-specific CTL. Sialic acid-containing peptides eluted from EL4 lymphoma cells could (a) stabilize H-2 molecules on RMA-S cells and (b) sensitize them for GD2-specific CTL. Control peptides (derived from vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein peptide and GD2-negative lymphomas) could also stabilize H-2 on RMA-S, but were resistant to GD2-specific CTL. These H-2-binding peptides could be purified by anti-GD2 affinity chromatography. We postulate a new class of naturally occurring epitopes for T cells where branched-chain oligosaccharides are linked to peptides with anchoring motifs for the major histocompatibility complex class I pocket. While analogous to the haptens trinitrophenyl and O-beta-linked acetyl-glucosamine, the potential implications of natural carbohydrates as antigenic epitopes for CTL in biology are considerable.

"The occurrence of Rabbit Viral Hemorrhagic Disease of domestic rabbits in the population of wild rabbits in Germany was proven through detection of antigen (hemagglutination) in spleen and liver in one animal and through detection of specific antibody in another animal. There was no epizootic connection between the two animals (different locations). The necropsy and histopathologic findings are presented from five wild rabbits which died from RVHD.

"We have previously described a passive serum therapy system in which potent protection against challenge of syngeneic mice with large doses (10(4) X LD100) of AD755a tumor cells can be accomplished by administration of as little as 2 to 5 microliters/mouse of hyperimmune anti-tumor cell serum. The present results demonstrate that the efficacy of the serum protection effect is strain-dependent and is under the control of a single genetic locus, denoted ADP-1. Through a series of crosses between highly protected C57BL/6J and nonprotected BALB/cJ mice, the ADP-locus has been mapped to chromosome 2 [linkage group V], approximately 23 centimorgans toward te centromere from the locus controlling agouti coat color. Thus, the protection locus is not linked to either the H-2 region or to previously described loci regulating the replication and disease induction of type-C viruses closely related to the virus associated with the AD775a tumor. The possible functions of the ADP-1 locus are discussed and further aspects of this experimental model are described in the accompanying papers.

"Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is a genetic risk factor for a wide range of major mental disorders, including schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorders. Recent reports suggest a potential role of DISC1 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), by referring to an interaction between DISC1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP), and to an association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism in a DISC1 intron and late onset of AD. However, the function of DISC1 in AD remains unknown. In this study, decreased levels of DISC1 were observed in the cortex and hippocampus of 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice, an animal model of AD. Overexpression of DISC1 reduced, whereas knockdown of DISC1 increased protein levels, but not mRNA levels of β-site APP-Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1), a key enzyme in amyloid-β (Aβ) generation. Reduction of BACE1 protein levels by overexpression of DISC1 was accompanied by an accelerating decline rate of BACE1, and was blocked by the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine, rather than proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Moreover, overexpression of DISC1 in the hippocampus with an adeno-associated virus reduced the levels of BACE1, soluble Aβ40/42, amyloid plaque density, and rescued cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. These results indicate that DISC1 attenuates Aβ generation and cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic mice through promoting lysosomal degradation of BACE1. Our findings provide new insights into the role of DISC1 in AD pathogenesis and link a potential function of DISC1 to the psychiatric symptoms of AD.

"The poxvirus, myxoma virus, encodes within its genome at least eleven different proteins that compromise, skew, or disable the innate and adaptive responses of its hosts. In the laboratory rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus, these effects result in myxomatosis, a fatal condition characterized by skin lesions and systemic immunosuppression. Interestingly, while myxoma infection also causes skin lesions in its natural host and in natural populations of O. cuniculus in Australia where this novel host and the virus have co-evolved, the condition of myxomatosis does not ensue and infection is not fatal. In this review I discuss the biochemical properties of the characterized immunomodulatory proteins of myxoma virus, and their pathogenic effects in laboratory rabbits. Disruption of any one myxoma immunomodulatory gene diminishes the severity of the infection without compromising infectivity. Thus, the characterized immunomodulatory genes appear not to be required for a productive infection in vivo. The differences in the severity of their effects in laboratory-bred versus wild O. cuniculus suggest that the outcome of myxoma infection is a consequence of the interplay between the viral immunomodulatory gene products and the cells and molecules of the host immune system.

"A large scale purification protocol employing zonal rotor centrifugation has been developed for scrapie prions. The extensively purified fractions derived using this protocol contained only one major protein, designated PrP, and rod-shaped particles. The rods measured 10 to 20 nm in diameter and 100 to 200 nm in length by negative staining; no other particles were consistently observed. SDS denaturation caused the rods to disappear, prion infectivity to diminish, and PrP to become sensitive to protease digestion. Arrays of prion rods ultrastructurally resembled purified amyloid and showed green birefringence by polarization microscopy after staining with Congo red dye. The rods appear to represent a polymeric form of the scrapie prion; each rod may contain as many as 1,000 PrP molecules. Our findings raise the possibility that the amyloid plaques observed in transmissible, degenerative neurological diseases might consist of prions.

"RNA interference (RNAi) mediates sequence-specific posttranscriptional gene silencing triggered by double-stranded RNA. RNAi is an effective tool for functional genomics in C. elegans, whereas biochemical characteristics of RNAi hamper its use in mammalian cells. We here analyze kinetic and quantitative aspects of mammalian RNAi in different cell lines using novel lentiviral constructs with double H1-shRNA expression cassettes located in the U3 region of the LTR. Using enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as a target gene for RNAi and red fluorescence protein (RFP) as surrogate marker for intracellular siRNA expression, we show that long-term siRNA expression mediates stable RNAi. Furthermore, RNAi-induced gene silencing varies from minimal to complete loss-of-function phenotypes within homogeneous and between different cell populations. Interestingly, the extent of gene silencing correlates to lentiviral integrations as well as siRNA expression levels in target cells. Finally, we demonstrate functional gene silencing of a cytokine receptor gene in normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells. These data suggest that the use of suitable lentiviral constructs to quantify siRNA expression in living cells may allow analysis of loss-of-function phenotypes in a dose-dependent manner in a wide variety of target cells.

"Lagovirus europaeus GI.2, also commonly known as rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 2, was first detected at two long-term monitoring sites for European rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus, in South Australia, in mid-2016. Numbers of rabbits in the following 12-18 months were reduced to approximately 20 per cent of average numbers in the preceding 10 years. The impact recorded at the two South Australian sites, if widespread in Australia and persistent for several years, is likely to be of enormous economic and environmental benefit.

"Essential HIV cure-related clinical trials (HCRCT) have a potentially high-risk profile in terms of participants' health, which could hinder enrollment by people living with HIV (PLWH) and healthcare professionals (HP). The ANRS-APSEC survey is part of the IAS ""Towards an HIV cure"" initiative, which promotes multidisciplinary research for a safe, affordable and scalable cure. The study objectives were to understand the psychosocial mechanisms underlying PLWH and HP viewpoints about future HCRCT. Six focus group discussions (three with PLWH (n = 21) and three with HP (n = 30)) were held in three French infectious disease units. From these, three perspectives on HCRCT were identified. The first involved beliefs and knowledge associating HCRCT with poorer health and quality of life for PLWH. The second concerned perceptions of HCRCT as a biological and epidemiological flashback to a situation when HIV infection was left uncontrolled. The third was characterized by aspects of historical HIV culture that embrace innovation.

"We have characterized monoclonal antibodies raised against the neuraminidase (NA) of a Sydney-like influenza virus (A/Memphis/31/98, H3N2) in a reassortant virus A/NWS/33(HA)-A/Mem/31/98(NA) (H1N2) and nine escape mutants selected by these monoclonal antibodies. Five of the antibodies use the same heavy chain VDJ genes and may not be independent. Another antibody, Mem5, uses the same V(H) and J genes with a different D gene and different isotype. Sequence changes in escape mutants selected by these antibodies occur in two loops of the NA, at amino acid 198, 199, 220, or 221. These amino acids are located on the opposite side of the NA monomer to the major epitopes found in N9 and early N2 NAs. Escape mutants with a change at 198 have reduced NA activity compared to the wild-type virus. Asp198 points toward the substrate binding pocket, and we had previously found that a site-directed mutation of this amino acid resulted in a loss of enzyme activity (M. R. Lentz, R. G. Webster, and G. M. Air, Biochemistry 26:5351-5358, 1987). Mutations at residue 199, 220, or 221 did not alter the NA activity significantly compared to that of wild-type NA. A 3.5-A structure of Mem5 Fab complexed with the Mem/98 NA shows that the Mem5 antibody binds at the sites of escape mutation selected by the other antibodies.

"In Europe, the increasing number of nephropathia epidemica (NE) infections in humans, caused by Puumala virus carried by bank voles (Myodes glareolus), has triggered studies of environmental factors driving these infections. NE infections have been shown to occur in specific geographical areas characterized by environmental factors that influence the distribution and dynamics of host populations and virus persistence in the soil. Here, we review the influence of environmental conditions (including climate factors, food availability and habitat conditions) with respect to incidence in humans and seroprevalence in rodents, considering both direct and indirect transmission pathways. For each type of environmental factor, results and discrepancies between studies are presented and examined in the light of biological hypotheses. Overall, food availability and temperature appear to be the main drivers of host seroprevalence and NE incidence, but data quality and statistical approaches varied greatly among studies. We highlight the issues that now need to be addressed and suggest improvements for study design in regard to the current knowledge on hantavirus epidemiology.

"The flavivirus, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks and may cause severe and potentially lethal neurological tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in humans. Studying TBEV requires the use of secondary methodologies to detect the virus in infected cells. To overcome this problem, we rationally designed and constructed a recombinant reporter TBEV that stably expressed the mCherry reporter protein. The resulting TBEV reporter virus (named mCherry-TBEV) and wild-type parental TBEV exhibited similar growth kinetics in cultured cells; however, the mCherry-TBEV virus produced smaller plaques. The magnitude of mCherry expression correlated well with progeny virus production but remained stable over <4 passages in cell culture. Using well-characterized antiviral compounds known to inhibit TBEV, 2'-C-methyladenosine and 2'-deoxy-2'-β-hydroxy-4'-azidocytidine (RO-9187), we demonstrated that mCherry-TBEV is suitable for high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs. Serum samples from a TBEV-vaccinated human and a TBEV-infected dog were used to evaluate the mCherry-based neutralization test. Collectively, recombinant mCherry-TBEV reporter virus described here provides a powerful tool to facilitate the identification of potential antiviral agents, and to measure levels of neutralizing antibodies in human and animal sera.

"Congenital heart defects are the most common birth defect. The limiting factor in tissue engineering repair strategies is an autologous source of functional cardiomyocytes. Amniotic fluid contains an ideal cell source for prenatal harvest and use in correction of congenital heart defects. This study aims to investigate the potential of amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFSC) to undergo non-viral reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) followed by growth-factor-free differentiation into functional cardiomyocytes. AFSC from human second trimester amniotic fluid were transfected by non-viral vesicle fusion with modified mRNA of OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, LIN28, cMYC and nuclear GFP over 18 days, then differentiated using inhibitors of GSK3 followed 48 hours later by inhibition of WNT. AFSC-derived iPSC had high expression of OCT4, NANOG, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81 after 18 days of mRNA transfection and formed teratomas containing mesodermal, ectodermal, and endodermal germ layers in immunodeficient mice. By Day 30 of cardiomyocyte differentiation, cells contracted spontaneously, expressed connexin 43 and β-myosin heavy chain organized in sarcomeric banding patterns, expressed cardiac troponin T and β-myosin heavy chain, showed upregulation of NKX2.5, ISL-1 and cardiac troponin T with downregulation of POU5F1, and displayed calcium and voltage transients similar to those in developing cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate that cells from human amniotic fluid can be differentiated through a pluripotent state into functional cardiomyocytes.

"Pseudotype vectors are promising for gene transfer in many gene therapy approaches, however, low-vector concentration in batch cultures and high temperature-dependent decay do limit sufficiently large-scale production. To overcome these obstacles, the kinetic relations of cell growth and vector formation in different culture modes need to be understood. Effective optimisation of process modes is needed to achieve sufficient yields. Experimental and modelling studies were carried out in order to analyse the impact of different process modes such as perfusion, perfused fed-batch or repeated-batch on vector titer and productivity. Retroviral pseudotype vector, derived from the murine leukaemia virus carrying the HIV-1 envelop protein MLV (HIV-1) were produced using a 200 ml fixed bed reactor for high cell density cultivation on macroporous carriers. After starting the cultivation in batch mode, the reactor was either run in perfusion, perfused fed-batch or repeated-batch. A mathematical model of the bioreaction was developed on the basis of experimental data measured in culture dishes. The ability of the model to describe all different process modes of fixed-bed cultivation without additional fitting of the parameters was proven by three long-term cultivations for more than 400 h. The results of optimisation with the aid of the model, leads to the conclusion that perfusion with optimised harvest cycles and fed flows, result in a higher yield in comparison to batch or fed batch culture.

"BACKGROUND: Approximately 60% of emerging viruses are of zoonotic origin, with three-fourths derived from wild animals. Many of these zoonotic diseases are transmitted by rodents with important information about their reservoir dynamics and pathogenesis missing. One main reason for the gap in our knowledge is the lack of adequate cell culture systems as models for the investigation of rodent-borne (robo) viruses in vitro. Therefore we established and characterized a new cell line, BVK168, using the kidney of a bank vole, Myodes glareolus, the most abundant member of the Arvicolinae trapped in Germany. RESULTS: BVK168 proved to be of epithelial morphology expressing tight junctions as well as adherence junction proteins. The BVK168 cells were analyzed for their infectability by several arbo- and robo-viruses: Vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, Sindbis virus, Pixuna virus, Usutu virus, Inkoo virus, Puumalavirus, and Borna disease virus (BDV). The cell line was susceptible for all tested viruses, and most interestingly also for the difficult to propagate BDV. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the newly established cell line from wildlife rodents seems to be an excellent tool for the isolation and characterization of new rodent-associated viruses and may be used as in vitro-model to study properties and pathogenesis of these agents.

"Pathogenic hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are rodent-borne viruses causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia. In Europe, there are more than 10,000 yearly cases of nephropathia epidemica (NE), a mild form of HFRS caused by Puumala virus (PUUV). The common and widely distributed bank vole (Myodes glareolus) is the host of PUUV. In this study, we aim to explain and predict NE incidence in boreal Sweden using bank vole densities. We tested whether the number of rainy days in winter contributed to variation in NE incidence. We forecast NE incidence in July 2013-June 2014 using projected autumn vole density, and then considering two climatic scenarios: 1) rain-free winter and 2) winter with many rainy days. Autumn vole density was a strong explanatory variable of NE incidence in boreal Sweden in 1990-2012 (R2 = 79%, p<0.001). Adding the number of rainy winter days improved the model (R2 = 84%, p<0.05). We report for the first time that risk of NE is higher in winters with many rainy days. Rain on snow and ground icing may block vole access to subnivean space. Seeking refuge from adverse conditions and shelter from predators, voles may infest buildings, increasing infection risk. In a rainy winter scenario, we predicted 812 NE cases in boreal Sweden, triple the number of cases predicted in a rain-free winter in 2013/2014. Our model enables identification of high risk years when preparedness in the public health sector is crucial, as a rainy winter would accentuate risk.

"An increased risk for hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by Puumala hantavirus was forecast for Sweden in 2007. The forecast was based on a predicted increase in the number of Myodes glareolus rodents (reservoir hosts). Despite raised awareness and preparedness, the number of human cases during July 2007-June 2008 was 1,483, a new high.

"In May 2014, 11 sandy soil samples were collected at a depth of about 5 to 15 cm from a golf course community in Wilmington, NC, composed of Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) from the fairway, St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum) from the lawn, and Zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica) from the tee, all of which showed spotted yellowing and necrosis. Plant-parasitic nematodes were extracted from soil samples by a combination of elutriation and sugar centrifugal-flotation methods at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Nematode Assay Lab, Raleigh, NC. The results revealed the presence of several plant-parasitic nematodes, with a stubby-root nematode (Trichodoridae) present. Population densities of stubby-root nematodes were 10 to 90 (average 50) nematodes per 500 cm(3) of soil. This species was clearly different from the parthenogenetic stubby-root nematode Nanidorus minor (Colbran, 1956) Siddiqi, 1974 commonly found in North Carolina because of the presence of males and larger body size. Morphological and molecular analyses of this nematode identified the species as Trichodorus obtusus Cobb, 1913. Morphological features of T. obtusus specimens were examined in glycerol permanent mounts. Males (n = 5) had a ventrally curved spicule, three ventromedian precloacal papillae (one ventromedian cervical papilla anterior to the excretory pore, one pair of lateral cervical pores at the level of the ventromedian cervical papilla), and a tail with a non-thickened terminal cuticle. Males were 860 to 1,120 (average 1,018) μm long, body width 38 to 48 (42) μm, onchiostyle 53 to 60 (56) μm, and spicule 54 to 62 (59) μm. Females (n = 5) had a pore-like vulva, a barrel-shaped vagina, and one or two postadvulvar lateral body pores on each side. Females were 990 to 1,330 (1,148) μm long, body width 43 to 56 (48) μm, onchiostyle 50 to 64 (58) μm, and V 49.0 to 57.5% (53.0%). The morphology agreed with the description of T. obtusus (2). DNA was prepared by squashing a single nematode (n = 3) on a microscope slide and collecting in 50 μl of AE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 0.5 mM EDTA; pH 9.0). The 18S rDNA region was amplified with the forward primers 18S-G18S4 (5' GCTTGTCTCAAAGATTAAGCC 3'), SSUF07 (AAAGATTAAGCCATGCATG), and 18S965 (GGCGATCAGATACCGCCCTAGTT) and reverse primers 18S-18P (TGATCCWKCYGCAGGTTCAC), SSUR26 (CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG), and 18S1573R (TACAAAGGGCAGGGACGTAAT). The 28S D2/D3 region was amplified with the forward primer 28S391a (AGCGGAGGAAAAGAAACTAA) and reverse primer 28S501 (TCGGAAGGAACCAGCTACTA) (4). The resulting 18S (1,547-bp) and 28S D2/D3 (925-bp) sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KM276665 and KM276666. The 18S sequence data was 100% homologous with two populations of T. obtusus (JX279930, 898 bp, and JX289834, 897 bp) from South Carolina and one (AY146460, 634 bp) from an unknown source, each with a 1-bp difference in a Blastn search. The 28S D2/D3 sequence data was less than 90% homologous with many Trichodorus species, but no T. obtusus sequence data was available. T. obtusus is known to occur only in the United States and to damage turfgrasses. It is reported in the states of Virginia, Florida, South Carolina, Texas, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, New York, and South Dakota. This nematode has been reported as a pathogen of bermudagrass in Florida (1) and South Carolina (3), but pathogenicity to St. Augustinegrass and Zoysiagrass is unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first report of T. obtusus on turfgrasses in North Carolina. References: (1) W. T. Crow and J. K. Welch. Nematropica 34:31, 2004. (2) W. Decraemer.

"Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a member of the Poxviridae family and the genus Leporipoxvirus. In nature MYXV tropism is restricted to lagomorphs, and is specifically pathogenic only for European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), in which this virus causes the lethal systemic disease called myxomatosis. Importantly, although MYXV cannot cause any disease pathology in humans, mice, or any other domestic animals other than rabbit, this virus can productively infect and kill a variety of human and murine cancer cells, from either primary sources or cultured cancer cell lines. Therefore, in the last decade, MYXV has emerged as a novel oncolytic virus against hematologic malignancies and various solid cancers. One novel aspect of MYXV virotherapy is a new systemic virus delivery strategy to cancer sites in the recipient, by which adsorption of the virus to isolated leukocytes is conducted prior to reinfusion of the virus-infected cells back into the recipient, via a procedure called ex vivo virotherapy (EVV, or simply EV2). The EV2 delivery strategy thus exploits the inherent migratory properties of leukocytes to ferry MYXV to tissue sites bearing cancer cells that are accessible to leukocyte chemotaxis. Here, we describe EV2 procedures with MYXV to systemically deliver the virus to sites of disseminated and/or metastatic cancer in situ via infected leukocytes derived from either bone marrow or peripheral blood.

"Two classes of peptide-producing neurons in the arcuate nucleus (Arc) of the hypothalamus are known to exert opposing actions on feeding: the anorexigenic neurons that express proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and the orexigenic neurons that express agouti-related protein (AgRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). These neurons are thought to arise from a common embryonic progenitor, but our anatomical and functional understanding of the interplay of these two peptidergic systems that contribute to the control of feeding remains incomplete. The present study uses a combination of optogenetic stimulation with viral and transgenic approaches, coupled with neural activity mapping and brain transparency visualization to demonstrate the following: (i) selective activation of Arc POMC neurons inhibits food consumption rapidly in unsated animals; (ii) activation of Arc neurons arising from POMC-expressing progenitors, including POMC and a subset of AgRP neurons, triggers robust feeding behavior, even in the face of satiety signals from POMC neurons; (iii) the opposing effects on food intake are associated with distinct neuronal projection and activation patterns of adult hypothalamic POMC neurons versus Arc neurons derived from POMC-expressing lineages; and (iv) the increased food intake following the activation of orexigenic neurons derived from POMC-expressing progenitors engages an extensive neural network that involves the endogenous opioid system. Together, these findings shed further light on the dynamic balance between two peptidergic systems in the moment-to-moment regulation of feeding behavior.

"Disoxaril inhibits enterovirus replication by binding to the hydrophobic pocket within the VP1 coat protein, thus stabilizing the virion and blocking its uncoating. Disoxaril-resistant (RES) mutants of the Coxsackievirus B1 (CVB1/RES) were derived from the wild disoxaril-sensitive (SOF) strain (CVB1/SOF) using a selection approach. A disoxaril-dependent (DEP) mutant (CVB1/DEP) was obtained following nine consecutive passages of the disoxaril-resistant mutant in the presence of disoxaril. Phenotypic characteristics of the disoxaril mutants were investigated. A timing-of-addition study of the CVB1/DEP replication demonstrated that in the absence of disoxaril the virus particle assembly stopped. VP1 RNA sequences of disoxaril mutants were compared with the existing Gen Bank CVB1 reference structure. The amino acid sequence of a large VP1 196-258 peptide (disoxaril-binding region) of CVB1/RES was significantly different from that of the CVB1/SOF. Crucially important changes in CVB1/RES were two point mutations, M213H and F237L, both in the ligand-binding pocket. The sequence analysis of the CVB1/DEP showed some reversion to CVB1/SOF. The amino acid sequences of the three VP1 proteins are presented.

"The woodchuck (Marmota monax) has proven to be a suitable animal model for studying hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection owing to similarities in the course of infection between woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) in woodchucks and HBV in humans. (-)-beta-L-2',3'-Dideoxy-3'-thiacytidine (3TC; lamivudine) is a nucleoside analog which has demonstrated antiviral activity against HBV as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The purpose of the present investigation was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of 3TC following intravenous and oral administration of 20 mg of 3TC per kg of body weight to woodchucks. Following intravenous administration, the concentrations of 3TC in plasma declined, with a terminal half-life of 2.84 +/- 0.85 h (mean +/- standard deviation). The systemic clearance and steady-state volume of distribution of 3TC were 0.22 +/- 0.078 liters/h/kg and 0.75 +/- 0.13 liters/kg, respectively. The renal clearance of the nucleoside analog was 0.063 +/- 0.016 liters/h/kg. The oral bioavailability of 3TC ranged from 18 to 54%. Allometric relationships between pharmacokinetic parameters and body weight developed by Hussey et al. (E.K. Hussey, K.H. Donn, M.J. Daniel, S.T. Hall, A.J. Harker, and G.L. Evans, J. Clin. Pharmacol. 34:975-977, 1994) were augmented by including data from woodchucks, monkeys (S.M. Blaney, M.J. Daniel, A.J. Harker, K. Godwin, and F.M. Balis, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39:2779-2782, 1995), and additional data from rats (P. Rajagopalan, L. Moore, C.K. Chu, R.F. Schinazi, and F.D. Boudinot, submitted for publication). Interspecies scaling of the pharmacokinetic parameters of 3TC demonstrated a good correlation between clearance (0.74 . W0.76 [where W is body weight]; r = 0.93; P < 0.025), apparent volume of distribution (1.62 . W0.81; r = 0.98; P < 0.005), and steady-state volume of distribution (1.09 . W0.94; r = 0.99; P < 0.05) and species body weight. The allometric relationships for clearance and volume of distribution at steady state predicted the observed pharmacokinetic parameters in humans quite well; however, the apparent volume of distribution was underestimated in humans. Thus, the pharmacokinetic data obtained with the woodchuck HBV animal model should be useful for designing clinical trials.

"During the 1996 summer season (January-April) in South Africa an estimated 500 horses died of African horse sickness (AHS); 80% of deaths were due to AHS virus serotypes 2 and 4. Nearly all cases occurred in the northern, north-eastern and central parts of South Africa. This study reports the first attempt to verify the involvement of the biting midge Culicoides imicola in a field outbreak of AHS in southern Africa. In light-trap collections made at 47 sites over 12 weeks, C. imicola comprised 94.2% of 4.78 million Culicoides. Culicoides imicola was the most prevalent of 34 species captured and was the only species whose distribution matched that of the disease. Record catches of C. imicola were made, and reveal that in years of above average rainfall its numbers can show a 200-fold increase over those in dry years. Soil type appeared to determine strongly the distribution of C. imicola. The largest populations of C. imicola were found in areas with clayey, moisture-retentive soils whereas the lowest numbers, or none, occurred in areas where the soils were sandy and quick-draining. The deaths of two horses (confirmed AHS) in a sandy area were perplexing as they occurred in a region known to be free of C. imicola. The probable origin of these infections was established.

"Gene therapy is an attractive approach for the treatment of liver disease. We demonstrate that a so-called third-generation human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-derived vector system can govern the efficient delivery, integration, and stable expression of a transgene into primary human hepatocytes in the complete absence of cell division. We also show that rodent hepatocytes exhibit a significant degree of resistance to HIV vector-mediated transduction, a phenotype that is particularly pronounced in murine hepatocytes and that results from a block in the immediate-early phase of infection. We finally describe a methodology, that allows very high rates of transduction through minimal in vitro manipulation, in which hepatocytes are kept in suspension and reimplanted within a few hours of harvest with a fully preserved engraftment potential. These results have immediate implications for the treatment of liver diseases by the transplantation of genetically modified hepatocytes, an approach that could be applied to a number of hereditary and acquired hepatic disorders.

"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and antiretroviral medications are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In the pre-antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, HIV-infected patients had increased morbidity and mortality from opportunistic infections; in the post-ART era, these patients are at increased risk of chronic diseases such as acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy. They may present with vague symptoms such as weakness, dyspnea, or fatigue as the initial presentation of their cardiovascular disease. An overview of the clinical presentation, workup, management, and treatment of different cardiovascular disease is provided in this article.

"The crystal structure of Fab of an Ab PC283 complexed with its corresponding peptide Ag, PS1 (HQLDPAFGANSTNPD), derived from the hepatitis B virus surface Ag was determined. The PS1 stretch Gln2P to Phe7P is present in the Ag binding site of the Ab, while the next three residues of the peptide are raised above the binding groove. The residues Ser11P, Thr12P, and Asn13P then loop back onto the Ag-binding site of the Ab. The last two residues, Pro14P and Asp15P, extend outside the binding site without forming any contacts with the Ab. The PC283-PS1 complex is among the few examples where the light chain complementarity-determining regions show more interactions than the heavy chain complementarity-determining regions, and a distal framework residue is involved in Ag binding. As seen from the crystal structure, most of the contacts between peptide and Ab are through the five residues, Leu3-Asp4-Pro5-Ala6-Phe7, of PS1. The paratope is predominantly hydrophobic with aromatic residues lining the binding pocket, although a salt bridge also contributes to stabilizing the Ag-Ab interaction. The molecular surface area buried upon PS1 binding is 756 A(2) for the peptide and 625 A(2) for the Fab, which is higher than what has been seen to date for Ab-peptide complexes. A comparison between PC283 structure and a homology model of its germline ancestor suggests that paratope optimization for PS1 occurs by improving both charge and shape complementarity.

"Ehrlich ascites tumour (EAT) cells were fused with Theileria parva-infected bovine lymphoid (C2) cells using inactivated Sendai virus. A variety of techniques were employed to try and increase fusion percentage and harvest of heterokaryons. There was no evidence that pre-exposure of C2 cells to Sendai virus or phytohaemagglutinin improved fusion percentage, but the percentage was higher when 10(8) C2 cells were fused with 10(7) EAT cells, as compared with a ratio of 10(7) C2: 10(6) EAT. An increased yield of multinucleate cells was obtained using a calf serum gradient to separate cells of different sizes. An attempt to fuse EAT cells with free macroschizonts was not sucessful. When cells were grown in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium (HAT), T parva appeared to be selectively killed by the aminopterin present; this finding would seem to militate against the use of a HAT selection system to clone parasitised hybrids. C2 cells could be selected out by passage of mixed cultures through mice, but no evidence of parasitosis was detected in EAT cells which became established.

"Meliacine (MA), a peptide isolated from leaves of the high plant Melia azedarach L inhibited the multiplication of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) in BHK-21 cells. In this report, we establish that the MA-inhibitable process takes place within the first hour of the viral reproductive cycle. MA had no virucidal effect and did not affect adsorption and penetration of the virus in cells. In experiments with neutral red-labeled virus, it was found that MA significantly suppressed the development of photoresistance of the virus in infected cells. In untreated cultures nearly all virus which adsorbed to cells was uncoated within 1 h at 37 degrees C, whereas in treated cultures, even after 3 h only 3% of the virus was uncoated. Labeling of BHK-21 cells with acridine orange showed that MA affects the pH of intracellular acidic vesicles. Therefore, it is concluded that MA prevents the process of uncoating of FMDV in BHK-21 cells by inhibiting vacuolar acidification.

"OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of fatigue on individuals' global, cognitive, physical, and psychosocial functioning in the long term after hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment and its relationship with HCV clearance among patients coinfected with HIV and HCV exposed to peg-interferon/ribavirin-containing regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study sample included 107 coinfected patients treated for HCV during follow-up in the French ANRS CO13-HEPAVIH cohort. Analyses used scores from the Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS), assessed before treatment initiation and at last available measure after the end of treatment (2 years in median). Patient proportions with a clinically significant improvement in fatigue impact, defined as a decrease higher than 10 points in the 160-point global FIS score, were compared between HCV clearers and chronic HCV patients (Fisher's exact test). Relationships between HCV clearance and FIS scores were analyzed in linear regression models adjusted for sex, time since end of HCV treatment, and pretreatment scores. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of patients showed a clinically significant improvement in fatigue (15/57 in HCV clearers vs. 16/50 in chronic HCV patients, P=0.52). HCV clearance was not significantly associated with FIS scores in multivariate models. CONCLUSION: The role of HCV clearance in coinfected patients' functional recovery in the long term after peg-interferon/ribavirin treatment may be lesser than expected. Additional studies are needed in patients treated with direct-acting antiviral agents. In the meantime, the effectiveness of palliative care and targeted psychological treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing fatigue impact needs to be assessed in the many HCV-cured patients with HIV exposed to suboptimal interferon-based first-generation therapies.

"The crystal structure of the A-B domain of RB has defined the binding pocket for the LXCXE peptide motif. Using the crystal structure as a guide, we have inactivated the LXCXE-binding pocket by replacing N757 with Phe [to obtain RB(N757F)]. RB(N757F) does not bind to viral oncoproteins but retains the ability to bind and inhibit E2F. RB(N757F) is less effective than the wild-type RB [RB(WT)] in repressing E2F-regulated transcription, and its repression activity is not affected by trichostatin A, an inhibitor of histone deacetylases. However, RB(N757F) is as effective as RB(WT) in suppressing cell growth. Interestingly, RB(N757F) cannot establish an irreversible growth arrest in differentiated myocytes. Differentiated myocytes with RB(WT) become refractory to serum. By contrast, differentiated myocytes with RB(N757F) undergo DNA synthesis and phosphorylate RB(N757F) in response to serum, despite a high level of p21Cip1 expression. Mutation of the phosphorylation sites in RB(N757F) rescued its defect and allowed myocytes to permanently withdraw from the cell cycle. These results demonstrate that it is possible to inactivate the LXCXE-binding pocket without compromising the overall integrity of RB. Moreover, the LXCXE-binding pocket is dispensable for the intrinsic growth suppression function of RB. However, the LXCXE-binding function is essential for RB to establish the serum-refractory state in differentiated myocytes.

"Failure to induce synthesis of neutralizing Abs to the CD4 binding determinant (CD4BD) of gp120, a central objective in HIV vaccine research, has been alternately ascribed to insufficient immunogen binding to Abs in their germline V region configuration expressed as BCRs, insufficient adaptive mutations in Ab V regions, and conformational instability of gp120. We employed peptide analogs of gp120 residues 421-433 within the CD4BD (CD4BD(core)) to identify Abs produced without prior exposure to HIV (constitutive Abs). The CD4BD(core) peptide was recognized by single-chain Fv fragments from noninfected humans with lupus that neutralized genetically diverse strains belonging to various HIV subtypes. Replacing the framework region (FR) of a V(H)4-family single-chain Fv with the corresponding V(H)3-family FRs from single-chain Fv JL427 improved the CD4BD(core) peptide-binding activity, suggesting a CD4BD(core) binding site outside the pocket formed by the CDRs. Replacement mutations in the FR site vicinity suggested the potential for adaptive improvement. A very small subset of serum CD4BD(core)-specific serum IgAs from noninfected humans without autoimmune disease isolated by epitope-specific chromatography neutralized the virus potently. A CD4BD(core)-specific, HIV neutralizing murine IgM with H and L chain V regions (V(H) and V(L) regions) free of immunogen-driven somatic mutations was induced by immunization with a CD4BD(core) peptide analog containing an electrophilic group that binds B cells covalently. The studies indicate broad and potent HIV neutralization by constitutive Abs as an innate, germline-encoded activity directed to the superantigenic CD4BD(core) epitope that is available for amplification for vaccination against HIV.

"Pancreatic cancer is often fatal, and further effective therapeutic options are needed. This study was designed to assess whether the replication-restricted herpes simplex virus, G207, was effective in killing human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro. G207, a multimutated strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 carrying lacZ reporter gene, is capable of efficient cytolytic growth in many dividing cells, including certain tumor cells, but not in nondividing cells. Three human pancreatic cell lines, AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BxPC-3, were infected with G207 at different multiplicities of infection. After 24 hours, expression of the lacZ reporter gene was tested using a histochemical X-gal assay. In addition, cell lines were infected with G207 for 24 to 48 hours; then the virus obtained from cell pellets and media supernatant was used to infect Vero cells to obtain G207 titers by plaque assay. To assess whether increasing viral immediate early gene expression would improve cytolysis and virus production, similar experiments were performed with the addition of 0.5 mmol/L of hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) 1 hour after viral infection. Finally, MTS cell viability assays were performed to measure viable cells at 24 to 96 hours post infection. The X-gal assay data revealed a viral dose-dependent b-galactosidase expression, indicating G207 infectivity and expression of the lacZ reporter gene. Plaque assays demonstrated a viral dose-dependent increase in plaque formation, indicating viral production from all three cell lines. In addition, HMBA data indicated a modest increase in viral production. The MTS assay data indicated a dose-dependent cytotoxicity for G207 in the cell lines tested. G207 infects, replicates in, and is cytotoxic to the above-listed human pancreatic cell lines in vitro and warrants therapeutic evaluation in models of pancreatic cancer.

"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, replicates primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum and thereby triggers apoptosis of infected cells. This study investigated the hierarchical activation of the caspase network induced by JEV infection. It was found that JEV activated the initiators caspase-8 and -9, as well as effector caspase-3, in infected baby hamster kidney and mouse neuroblastoma (N18) cells. In neuronal N18 cells, JEV infection triggered cytochrome c release from mitochondria, which in turn activated caspase-9 and -3. Treatment of JEV-infected N18 cells with cyclosporin A or ruthenium red, which attenuate mitochondrial injuries, blocked activation of caspase-9 or -3, typifying that, in neuronal cells, this apoptosis involves the mitochondrial pathway. Alternatively, in caspase-3-deficient MCF-7 cells, JEV persisted and readily triggered a typical apoptotic response, including cytochrome c release and full activation of caspase-9 and -8 along with caspase-6, indicating that JEV did not require caspase-3 to manifest caspase-8 activation and apoptosis. Interestingly, a Fas-associated death-domain-containing protein (FADD) dominant-negative mutant, which interfered with transmission of the extracellular death signals into cells through the Fas/tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor, failed to block JEV-induced apoptosis and caspase-8 activation, implying that receptor oligomerization of the Fas/TNF pathway might not participate in JEV-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results illustrate that JEV infection triggers caspase cascades involving the initiators caspase-8 and -9, probably through FADD-independent but mitochondrion-dependent pathways.

"ONRAB® is a human adenovirus rabies glycoprotein recombinant vaccine developed to control rabies in wildlife. To support licensing and widespread use of the vaccine, safety studies are needed to assess its potential residual impact on wildlife populations. We examined the persistence of the ONRAB® vaccine virus in captive rabies vector and non-target mammals. This research complements work on important rabies vector species (raccoon, striped skunk, and red fox) but also adds to previous findings with the addition of some non-target species (Virginia opossum, Norway rats, and cotton rats) and a prolonged period of post vaccination monitoring (41 days). Animals were directly inoculated orally with the vaccine and vaccine shedding was monitored using quantitative real-time PCR applied to oral and rectal swabs. ONRAB® DNA was detected in both oral and rectal swabs from 6 h to 3 days post-inoculation in most animals, followed by a resurgence of shedding between days 17 and 34 in some species. Overall, the duration over which ONRAB® DNA was detectable was shorter for non-target mammals, and by day 41, no animal had detectable DNA in either oral or rectal swabs. All target species, as well as cotton rats and laboratory-bred Norway rats, developed robust humoral immune responses as measured by competitive ELISA, with all individuals being seropositive at day 31. Similarly, opossums showed good response (89% seropositive; 8/9), whereas only one of nine wild caught Norway rats was seropositive at day 31. These results support findings of other safety studies suggesting that ONRAB® does not persist in vector and non-target mammals exposed to the vaccine. As such, we interpret these data to reflect a low risk of adverse effects to wild populations following distribution of ONRAB® to control sylvatic rabies.

"Integrative Biology is exemplified by a diversity of recently established collaborations to study the genetic diversity of the European rabbit, Oryctolagus cuniculus. Molecular markers were developed and used to investigate the link between wild population decreases or domestication procedures and possible losses of genetic diversity. Simultaneously, a European programme was launched for the management of genetic resources. The Integrative Biology approach shows that changes in genetic diversity are often buffered by the flexibility of rabbit reproductive systems. It appears, also, that all domestic animals belong to a subset of the wild genetic pool of their species without major loss of diversity despite exposure to severe viral infections. Consequently, management of genetic resources for production purposes and conservation or protection of declining Iberian wild populations require different approaches and measures.

"In cells infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), CSL/CBF1 signaling is essential for viral replication and promotes the survival of KSHV-infected cells. CSL/CBF1 is a DNA adaptor molecule which recruits coactivator and corepressor complexes to regulate viral and cellular gene transcription and which is a major downstream effector molecule of activated Notch. The interaction of KSHV RTA and LANA with CSL/CBF1 has been shown to balance the lytic and latent viral life cycle. Here we report that a third KSHV protein, viral interferon regulatory factor 4 (vIRF4/K10), but none of the three other KSHV-encoded vIRFs, interacts with CSL/CBF1. Two regions of vIRF4 with dissimilar affinities contribute to CSL/CBF1 binding. Similar to Notch, vIRF4 targets the hydrophobic pocket in the beta trefoil domain of CSL/CBF1 through a short peptide motif which closely resembles a motif found in Notch but does not strictly follow the ΦWΦP consensus conserved in human and mouse Notch proteins. Our results suggest that vIRF4 might compete with Notch for CSL/CBF1 binding and signaling.

"OBJECTIVE: The fluorescent protein and gD envelope protein of equine herpes virus type 1 (EHV-1) were used to study the impact of tags on gD protein subcellular localization in BHK-21 cells. METHODS: With the EHV-1 genome as a template, the gD complete gene was amplified by PCR technique. The product of PCR was cloned to pAcGFP1-C1 and pDsRed2-N1 plasmids. The recombinant plasmids were designated as pAc-GFP-gD (GFP-gD) and pDs-gD-Red (gD-Red). The GFP gene was inserted into the posterior position of gD gene signal peptide sequence. The modified gD gene signal peptide sequence was cloned to pVAX-1 plasmid, so that pVAX-S-GFP-gD' (S-GFPgD') recombinant plasmid was constructed. Meanwhile, the flag tag was added to N-terminal of gD sequence and they were cloned to pVAX-1 expression vector for constructing pVAX-Flag-gD recombinant plasmid. The BHK-21 cells were transfected with the 4 different recombinant plasmids and the subcellular localizations of fusion proteins were determined by lasar confocal scan microscopy. RESULTS: Four eukaryotic expression vectors were constructed successfully. In BHK-21 cells, the vast majority of gD envelope proteins was localized in Golgi, and a small amount of gD was localized in the nucleus. CONCLUSION: Our finding reveals that the fluorescent protein of different insertion sites has no significant effects on the subcellular localization of gD, and provides a useful reference for other researchers.

"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is associated with the majority of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The diagnosis of HCC is usually made in the late stages of the disease, when treatment options are limited and prognosis is poor. We therefore have developed a method of glycoproteomic analysis in an attempt to discover serum markers that can assist in the early detection of HBV-induced liver cancer. Briefly, a comparative method for analysis of oligosaccharides released from serum glycoproteins and for recovery and identification of proteins with aberrant glycosylation, as a function of cancer diagnosis, is described. The model we have used is the woodchuck (Marmota monax), which shares similarities in the glycosylation pattern associated with liver proteins in human HCC. In this report, we show that woodchucks diagnosed with HCC have dramatically higher levels of serum-associated core alpha-1,6-linked fucose, as compared with woodchucks without a diagnosis of HCC. The coupling of this methodology with 2D gel proteomics has permitted the identification of several glycoproteins with altered glycosylation as a function of cancer. One such glycoprotein, Golgi Protein 73 (GP73), was found to be elevated and hyperfucosylated in animals with HCC. Further, the study showed GP73 to be elevated in the serum of people with a diagnosis of HCC, providing a validation of our approach. The potential of this technology for biomarker discovery and the implications of increased levels of GP73 in liver cancer are discussed.

"Bank voles are known reservoirs for Puumala hantavirus and probably also for Ljungan virus (LV), a suggested candidate parechovirus in type 1 diabetes etiology and pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether wild bank voles had been exposed to LV and if exposure associated to autoantibodies against insulin (IAA), glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GADA), or islet autoantigen-2 (IA-2A). Serum samples from bank voles (Myodes glareolus) captured in early summer or early winter of 1997 and 1998, respectively, were analyzed in radio binding assays for antibodies against Ljungan virus (LVA) and Puumala virus (PUUVA) as well as for IAA, GADA, and IA-2A. LVA was found in 25% (189/752), IAA in 2.5% (18/723), GADA in 2.6% (15/615), and IA-2A in 2.5% (11/461) of available bank vole samples. LVA correlated with both IAA (P = 0.007) and GADA (P < 0.001), but not with IA-2A (P = 0.999). There were no correlations with PUUVA, detected in 17% of the bank voles. Compared to LVA negative bank voles, LVA positive animals had higher levels of both IAA (P = 0.002) and GADA (P < 0.001), but not of IA-2A (P = 0.205). Levels of LVA as well as IAA and GADA were higher in samples from bank voles captured in early summer. In conclusion, LVA was detected in bank voles and correlated with both IAA and GADA but not with IA-2A. These observations suggest that exposure to LV may be associated with islet autoimmunity. It remains to be determined if islet autoantibody positive bank voles may develop diabetes in the wild. J. Med. Virol. 89:24-31, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In this French multicentre, open-label study, we analyzed the efficacy, safety and patient-reported outcomes of a boceprevir-based triple therapy in HCV genotype 1 cirrhotic patients awaiting liver transplantation (LT). METHODS: Patients received PEG-IFN/ribavirin (RBV) for 48 weeks (W) and boceprevir from W4 to W48 or until LT. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (80% males, median age: 56 years) were included. Fifty-seven percent had hepatocellular carcinoma and 43% end-stage liver disease. At enrolment, the median MELD score was 9 (range: 6-18); the Child-Pugh score was A in 65%, B in 35% and C in 2%. Therapy was discontinued because of severe adverse events (SAEs) in 39% of cases and virological inefficacy in 24%. 16% of patients had undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR24). LT was performed in 18 patients (35%). HCV RNA was undetectable in 16.6% at LT. Seven patients (14%) died and three deaths were attributed to treatment. SAEs (n=129) were observed in 84% of patients. Twenty-four percent of patients developed severe infections. Albumin<35g/L was independently associated with severe infection. Compared with baseline values, a significant decrease (P=0.02) of the physical dimension of health-related quality of life was observed between W4 and W24. The mean (95% CI) number of self-reported symptoms doubled during treatment (from 6.3 [4.8-7.7] to 11.8 [9.3-14.3]; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The safety of the PEG-IFN/RBV/boceprevir combination is poor in patients awaiting LT, with a high risk of severe infection. Moreover, the limited efficacy confirms the indication for IFN-free combinations in these patients.

"Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) causes most human hantavirus disease cases in Europe. PUUV disease outbreaks are usually synchronized Germany-wide driven by beech mast-induced irruptions of its host (bank vole, Myodes glareolus). Recent data indicate high vole abundance, high PUUV prevalence and high human incidence in summer 2019 for some regions, but elsewhere values were low to moderate. This significant lack of synchrony among regions in Germany is in contrast to previous studies. Health institutions need to be informed about the heterogeneous distribution of human PUUV infection risk to initiate appropriate actions.

"Some of the 12 criminal trials and sentences in France for HIV transmission in 1998-2011 attracted substantial public attention, with a possible negative impact on people living with HIV (PLWH) through reinforced stigma and discrimination. This analysis aimed to characterize PLWH enrolled in the representative ANRS-VESPA2 survey, aware of and concerned about convictions for HIV transmission. Being a migrant from Sub-Saharan Africa, having difficult socio-economic conditions, having unprotected sex with one's main partner and concealing one's HIV status were all factors statistically associated with concern about the sentences. Participants tempted to press charges against someone for infecting them were more likely to be younger, women, not living in a couple, unemployed, and to report a major depressive disorder. Concern about HIV-related criminal proceedings among the most vulnerable PLWH do not reflect the actual risk of prosecution they are exposed to.

"The retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor protein and the TATA-box-binding protein TFIID form contacts with a number of viral transactivator proteins. One of these, the adenovirus E1A protein, can bind to both proteins. Here we present evidence that the cellular transcription factor PU.1 can bind to both RB and TFIID. Like E1A, PU.1 binds to the conserved C-terminal domain of TFIID and to the RB ""pocket"" domain. The PU.1 sequences required to bind either protein lie within a 75-amino acid region which functions as an independent activation domain in vivo. The ability of PU.1 to contact directly both RB and TFIID through the same 75-residue domain prompted us to look for sequence similarity between these two proteins. We find that the previously defined domain A of the RB pocket shows sequence similarity to the conserved C terminus of TFIID, whereas domain B shows sequence similarity to a second general transcription factor, TFIIB. The potential for RB to influence transcription by using TFIID- and TFIIB-related functions is discussed.

"Cytosolic DNA activates cGAS (cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic AMP-GMP synthase)-STING (stimulator of interferon genes) signaling, which triggers interferon and inflammatory responses that help defend against microbial infection and cancer. However, aberrant cytosolic self-DNA in Aicardi-Goutière's syndrome and constituently active gain-of-function mutations in STING in STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI) patients lead to excessive type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, which cause difficult-to-treat and sometimes fatal autoimmune disease. Here, in silico docking identified a potent STING antagonist SN-011 that binds with higher affinity to the cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-binding pocket of STING than endogenous 2'3'-cGAMP. SN-011 locks STING in an open inactive conformation, which inhibits interferon and inflammatory cytokine induction activated by 2'3'-cGAMP, herpes simplex virus type 1 infection, Trex1 deficiency, overexpression of cGAS-STING, or SAVI STING mutants. In Trex1 (-/-) mice, SN-011 was well tolerated, strongly inhibited hallmarks of inflammation and autoimmunity disease, and prevented death. Thus, a specific STING inhibitor that binds to the STING CDN-binding pocket is a promising lead compound for STING-driven disease.

"Pleconaril (VP 63843) is a novel orally bioavailable small molecule with broad antipicornavirus (enterovirus and rhinovirus) activity. Ten independently derived pleconaril-resistant variants of coxsackievirus B3 were isolated from cell culture. The molecular basis of drug resistance and the biologic properties of the drug-resistant viruses were investigated. RNA sequence analysis revealed amino acid changes in the drug-binding pocket of the resistant variants. Thermal stability studies showed the drug-resistant viruses to be significantly less stable than wild type virus. When evaluated in a murine model in which wild type virus infection is 100% lethal, the drug-resistant viruses showed attenuated virulence with both reduced mortality and delayed time to death. Virus titers in heart and spleen were dramatically lower in drug-resistant virus-infected mice than in wild type virus-infected animals. The study results indicate that pleconaril-resistant virus variants are attenuated and significantly less virulent than drug-sensitive wild type virus.

"Throughout Korea, small mammals are hosts to a number of disease-causing agents that pose a health threat to U.S. and Korean military forces while they conduct field-training exercises. A seasonal rodent-borne disease surveillance program was established at two firing points (FP), FP-10, and FP-60, and conducted over five years from 2001 through 2005 in response to hantavirus cases among U.S. soldiers. The ecology of these sites consisted primarily of tall grasses associated with semi-permanent and temporary water sources (drainage ditches and a small stream) and dry-land agriculture farming. Eight species of rodents and one species of insectivore were collected, including Apodemus agrarius, Micromys minutus, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, Tscherskia triton, Microtus fortis, Myodes regulus, and Crocidura lasiura. The striped field mouse, A. agrarius, (primary reservoir for Hantaan virus, the causative agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever), was the most frequently collected, representing 90.6% of the 1,288 small mammals captured at both sites. Reported herein are the ecological parameters, seasonal population densities, and seasonal population characteristics associated with small mammals collected at two military training sites in the Republic of Korea.

"An amplifying role for oral epithelial cells (ECs) in Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been postulated to explain oral viral shedding. However, while lytic or latent EBV infections of oro/nasopharyngeal ECs are commonly detected under pathological conditions, detection of EBV-infected ECs in healthy conditions is very rare. In this study, a simple non-surgical tissue sampling procedure was used to investigate EBV infection in the periodontal epithelium that surrounds and attaches teeth to the gingiva. Surprisingly, we observed that the gingival ECs of the periodontium (pECs) are commonly infected with EBV and may serve as an important oral reservoir of latently EBV-infected cells. We also found that the basal level of epithelial EBV-infection is significantly increased in chronic periodontitis, a common inflammatory disease that undermines the integrity of tooth-supporting tissues. Moreover, the level of EBV infection was found to correlate with disease severity. In inflamed tissues, EBV-infected pECs appear to be prone to apoptosis and to produce larger amounts of CCL20, a pivotal inflammatory chemokine that controls tissue infiltration by immune cells. Our discovery that the periodontal epithelium is a major site of latent EBV infection sheds a new light on EBV persistence in healthy carriers and on the role of this ubiquitous virus in periodontitis. Moreover, the identification of this easily accessible site of latent infection may encourage new approaches to investigate and monitor other EBV-associated disorders.

"Tick infestations on small mammals were studied from April to November, 2010, in deciduous woodland in southern England in order to determine whether co-infestations with tick stages occurred on small mammals, a key requirement for endemic transmission of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). A total of 217 small mammals was trapped over 1,760 trap nights. Yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis) made up the majority (52.5%) of animals, followed by wood mice (A. sylvaticus) 35.5% and bank voles (Myodes glareolus) 12%. A total of 970 ticks was collected from 169 infested animals; 96% of ticks were Ixodes ricinus and 3% I. trianguliceps. Over 98% of ticks were larval stages. Mean infestation intensities of I. ricinus were significantly higher on A. flavicollis (6.53 ± 0.67) than on A. sylvaticus (4.96 ± 0.92) and M. glareolus (3.25 ± 0.53). Infestations with I. ricinus were significantly higher in August than in any other month. Co-infestations with I. ricinus nymphs and larvae were observed on six (3.6%) infested individuals, and fifteen small mammals (8.9%) supported I. ricinus - I. trianguliceps co-infestations. This work contributes further to our understanding of European small mammal hosts that maintain tick populations and their associated pathogens, and indicates that co-infestation of larvae and nymph ticks does occur in lowland UK. The possible implications for transmission of tick-borne encephalitis virus between UK ticks and small mammals are discussed.

"The proceedings of the Conference are summarized in the context of current understanding of perinatal susceptibility to carcinogenic agents. The consequences of exposure to either metabolism-dependent or direct-acting chemical carcinogens during fetal or neonatal life are quantitatively different from the effects of comparable doses of the same agents in adults. The nature of these differences and their relevance both for preventive medicine and for application to bioassay procedures for detection of suspected carcinogens are discussed for conventional (chemically reactive) carcinogenic compounds and for hormones. The degree of tissue differentiation at the time of exposure to a carcinogen and the genetics of the subject have been shown to affect susceptibility to induction of embryonal and differentiated types of tumors and by both chemical agents (including hormones) and viruses. The desirability of conducting parallel studies in two or more species when investigating mechanisms of perinatal/adult differences in susceptibility to carcinogens is emphasized.

"Three-color staining and sequential fluorescence analysis of the dyes bound to specific base regions and intercalating sites on DNA were used to detect alterations of chromatin organization in single cells. Two non-intercalating DNA-reactive fluorochromes, Hoechst 33342 (HO) with preferential binding to A-T and mithramycin (MI) which binds to G-C regions, were used for cell staining in combination with propidium iodide (PI), a dye that intercalates between DNA base pairs without base specificity. Blue (HO), green (MI), and red (PI) fluorescence intensities were quantitatively analyzed following sequential excitation of stained cells in a three-laser flow system (uv, 457 nm and 530 nm wavelengths). Competition for dye binding was not significant and, although energy transfer occurs, under appropriate conditions, DNA distribution profiles for exponentially growing cells exhibit relatively low coefficients of variation (CVs), G2 + M/G1 peak ratios near values of 2, and comparable percentages of cells in G1, S, and G2 + M for each of the three dyes. The fluorescence intensity of each dye is proportional to the relative number of specific base regions or intercalating sites accessible for dye binding in DNA. Electronic ratio analyses of blue to green and red to green fluorescence signals provided a measure of the correlation of A-T to G-C and intercalation to G-C sites, respectively, for dye-bound regions on the DNA. Ratio analyses were sensitive to conformational changes in chromatin structure that alter the relative proportion of different base regions in DNA accessible for dye binding. Using this method, rearrangements in chromatin structure were observed in synchronized CHO cells during progression through the cell cycle. The sensitivity of this method will make it useful in investigations on effects of various agents (i.e., drugs, irradiation, viruses) on chromatin structure in single cells. Also, the three-color DNA staining and analysis techniques have potential for improving chromosome resolution in flow karyotyping studies.

"Wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in Australia are the descendents of 24 animals from England released in 1859. We surveyed rabbits and rabbit fleas (Spilopsyllus cuniculi) in Australia for the presence of trypanosomes using parasitological and PCR-based methods. Trypanosomes were detected in blood from the European rabbits by microscopy, and PCR using trypanosome-specific small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene primers and those in rabbit fleas by PCR. This is the first record of trypanosomes from rabbits in Australia. We identified these Australian rabbit trypanosomes as Trypanosoma nabiasi, the trypanosome of the European rabbit, by comparison of morphology and SSU rRNA gene sequences of Australian and European rabbit trypanosomes. Phylogenetic analysis places T. nabiasi in a clade with rodent trypanosomes in the subgenus Herpetosoma and their common link appears to be transmission by fleas. Despite the strict host specificity of trypanosomes in this clade, phylogenies presented here suggest that they have not strictly cospeciated with their vertebrate hosts. We suggest that T. nabiasi was inadvertently introduced into Australia in the 1960s in its flea vector Spilopsyllus cuniculi, which was deliberately introduced as a potential vector of the myxoma virus. In view of the environmental and economic damage caused by rabbits in Australia and other islands, the development of a virulent or genetically modified T. nabiasi should be considered to control rabbits.

"Conditionally replication competent adenoviruses (Ads) that selectively replicate in cancer cells and simultaneously express a therapeutic cytokine, such as melanoma differentiation associated gene- 7/Interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24), a Cancer Terminator Virus (CTV-M7), hold potential for treating human cancers. To enhance the efficacy of the CTV-M7, we generated a chimeric Ad.5 and Ad.3 modified fiber bipartite CTV (Ad.5/3-CTV-M7) that can infect tumor cells in a Coxsackie Adenovirus receptor (CAR) independent manner, while retaining high infectivity in cancer cells containing high CAR. Although mda-7/IL-24 displays broad-spectrum anticancer properties, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells display an intrinsic resistance to mda-7/IL-24-mediated killing due to an mda-7/IL-24 mRNA translational block. However, using a chemoprevention gene therapy (CGT) approach with perillyl alcohol (POH) and a replication incompetent Ad to deliver mda-7/IL-24 (Ad.mda-7) there is enhanced conversion of mda-7/IL-24 mRNA into protein resulting in pancreatic cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo in nude mice containing human PDAC xenografts. This combination synergistically induces mda-7/IL-24-mediated cancer-specific apoptosis by inhibiting anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 protein expression and inducing an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response through induction of BiP/GRP-78, which is most evident in chimeric-modified non-replicating Ad.5/3- mda-7- and CTV-M7-infected PDAC cells. Moreover, Ad.5/3-CTV-M7 in combination with POH sensitizes therapy-resistant MIA PaCa-2 cell lines over-expressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL to mda-7/IL-24-mediated apoptosis. Ad.5/3-CTV-M7 plus POH also exerts a significant antitumor 'bystander' effect in vivo suppressing both primary and distant site tumor growth, confirming therapeutic utility of Ad.5/3-CTV-M7 plus POH in PDAC treatment, where all other current treatment strategies in clinical settings show minimal efficacy.

"The major histocompatibility complex class I molecules are receptors for intracellular peptides, both of self and non-self origin. When non-self peptides (eg., pathogen derived) are bound to the class I molecules, they form ligands for T cell receptors resulting in antigen specific lysis of the infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Therefore, an understanding of the process of antigen recognition requires the precise definition of the structural features of the bimolecular complex formed by a single well defined antigenic peptide bound to the class I molecule. A strategy using antibodies was developed to probe the structural features of the H-2Kb containing a defined peptide in the antigen cleft. We report that the binding surface area of a Kb specific monoclonal antibody (28-13-3s) includes residues in the alpha 1 (Gly56 and Glu58) and alpha 2 (Trp167) helices of Kb thus, binding across the antigen binding groove. When cells treated with the antigenic peptide of vesicular stomatitis virus, N52-59, and its alanine substituted analogs were tested for 28-13-3s binding, it was found that position 1 of the peptide also forms a part of the antibody binding site. This finding strongly supports the positioning of the N-terminus of N52-59 proximal to pocket A, thus, assuming an orientation parallel to the alpha 1 helix.

"The murine Unp gene encodes a widely expressed ubiquitin-specific protease. The predicted sequence of the UNP protein features motifs common to viral oncoproteins through which these proteins interact with the retinoblastoma gene product pRb, as well as the related 'pocket proteins' p107 and p130. We have explored the possibility that UNP interacts with pocket proteins, and report here that such associations can be detected in vitro and in cells. Associations of UNP and pocket proteins are sensitive to site-directed mutations in a manner directly analogous to those documented in viral oncoproteins. We conclude that within cells UNP does physically associate with pRb, and can also associate with p107 and p130.

"The lethal yellow (Ay) mutation is the most dominant allele at the agouti locus of the mouse. Mice heterozygous for this allele have a yellow coat color, are genetically obese with an increased susceptibility to cancer, and have other metabolic derangements. Mice homozygous for Ay die early in embryogenesis, possibly because of a trophectoderm defect. The Ay mutation is distinguished from the many alleles described at the agouti locus in being associated with an endogenous provirus, designated endogenous ecotropic murine leukemia viral locus 15 (Emv-15). To obtain DNA sequences from regions close to or within the agouti locus, we have isolated the Emv-15 provirus and have found that the DNA sequences adjacent to the provirus are part of a mouse gene that is expressed in the same transcriptional orientation as the proviral genes. These mouse DNA sequences recognize two distinct size classes of RNA in various adult wild-type tissues including skin. In Ay heterozygotes both types of transcript hybridize to the proviral long terminal repeat, and, in heterozygous spleens, the shorter transcript is present at an enhanced steady-state level. These results suggest that the Ay-associated provirus (Emv-15) is distinguished from the endogenous C-type proviruses described to date in having altered the expression of a flanking host gene by promoter insertion, resulting in the production of chimeric viral-host fusion transcripts.

"The genome of Muju virus (MUJV), identified originally in the royal vole (Myodes regulus) in Korea, was fully sequenced to ascertain its genetic and phylogenetic relationship with Puumala virus (PUUV), harbored by the bank vole (My. glareolus), and a PUUV-like virus, named Hokkaido virus (HOKV), in the grey red-backed vole (My. rufocanus) in Japan. Whole genome sequence analysis of the 6544-nucleotide large (L), 3652-nucleotide medium (M) and 1831-nucleotide small (S) segments of MUJV, as well as the amino acid sequences of their gene products, indicated that MUJV strains from different capture sites might represent genetic variants of PUUV, the prototype arvicolid rodent-borne hantavirus in Europe. Distinct geographic-specific clustering of MUJV was found in different provinces in Korea, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that MUJV and HOKV share a common ancestry with PUUV. A better understanding of the taxonomic classification and pathogenic potential of MUJV must await its isolation in cell culture.

"In Europe, hantaviruses (Bunyaviridae) are small mammal-associated zoonotic and emerging pathogens that can cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Puumala virus, the main etiological agent carried by the bank vole Myodes glareolus is responsible for a mild form of HFRS while Dobrava virus induces less frequent but more severe cases of HFRS. Since 2000 in Europe, more than 3000 cases of HFRS have been recorded, in average, each year, which is nearly double compared to the previous decade. In addition to this upside long-term trend, significant oscillations occur. Epidemic years appear, usually every 2-4 years, with an increased incidence, generally in localized hot spots. Moreover, the virus has been identified in new areas in the recent years. A great number of surveys have been carried out in order to assess the prevalence of the infection in the reservoir host and to identify links with different biotic and abiotic factors. The factors that drive the infections are related to the density and diversity of bank vole populations, prevalence of infection in the reservoir host, viral excretion in the environment, survival of the virus outside its host, and human behavior, which affect the main transmission virus route through inhalation of infected rodent excreta. At the scale of a rodent population, the prevalence of the infection increases with the age of the individuals but also other parameters, such as sex and genetic variability, interfere. The contamination of the environment may be correlated to the number of newly infected rodents, which heavily excrete the virus. The interactions between these different parameters add to the complexity of the situation and explain the absence of reliable tools to predict epidemics. In this review, the factors that drive the epidemics of hantaviruses in Middle Europe are discussed through a panorama of the epidemiological situation in Belgium, France, and Germany.

"Mature mouse beta defensin 2 (mBD2) is a small cationic peptide with antimicrobial activity. Here we established a prokaryotic expression vector containing the cDNA of mature mBD2 fused with thioredoxin (TrxA), pET32a-mBD2. The vector was transformed into Escherichia Coli (E. coli) Rosseta-gami (2) for expression fusion protein. Under the optimization of fermentation parameters: induce with 0.6 mM isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) at 34°C in 2×YT medium and harvest at 6 h postinduction, fusion protein TrxA-mBD2 was high expressed in the soluble fraction (>95%). After cleaved fusion protein by enterokinase, soluble mature mBD2 was achieved 6 mg/L with a volumetric productivity. Purified recombinant mBD2 demonstrated clear broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for fungi, bacteria and virus. The MIC of antibacterial activity of against Staphylococcus aureus was 50 μg/ml. The MIC of against Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans) was 12.5μg/ml and 25μg/ml, respectively. Also, the antimicrobial activity of mBD2 was effected by NaCl concentration. Additionally, mBD2 showed antiviral activity against influenza A virus (IAV), the protective rate for Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) was 93.86% at the mBD2 concentration of 100 μg/ml. These works might provide a foundation for the following research on the mBD2 as therapeutic agent for medical microbes.

"The transport of poliovirus type 1 (strain LSc) was studied in Red Bay sandy loam columns that were treated with chemical- or polyelectrolyte-conditioned dewatered sludges and then leached with natural rainwater under saturated flow conditions. Poliovirus was concentrated in the alum and ferric chloride sludges that were produced following the flocculation of virus-seeded raw sewage. Virtually complete inactivation of the virus was observed following the flocculation of raw sewage or the stabilization of alum and ferric chloride sludges with lime at pH 11.5. Poliovirus was also concentrated in polyelectrolyte-conditioned dewatered sludge that was produced from virus-seeded, anaerobically digested sludge. Despite the saturated flow conditions for a sustained period, no viruses were detected in the leachates of the soil columns that were treated with these chemical and chemically treated sludges. Since the viruses were mostly associated with the solids in these sludge samples, it is believed that they were immobilized along with the sludge solids in the top portion of the soil columns.

"Information gathered during the past decade indicates that the eastern flying squirrel, Glaucomys volans, is a zoonotic reservoir of Rickettsia prowazekii - causative agent of louse-borne (epidemic) typhus. The sporadic cases o f typhus that have occurred in the USA in association with flying squirrels provide evidence that flying squirrels can transmit R. prowazekii infection to humons. Strains of R. prowazekii, isolated from flying squirrels multiply readily in human body lice, but flying squirrel lice, although readily infected, are very host specific and tend not to bite humans. It may be that the infection is spread to humans in infective ectoporasite faeces aerosolized when the flying squirrels groom themselves. As Joseph McDade emphasizes in this article, current concepts of typhus epidemiology and control must be re-evaluated to take into account this zoonotic aspect.

"Our knowledge of the lagomorph immune system remains largely based upon studies of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), a major model for studies of immunology. Two important and devastating viral diseases, rabbit hemorrhagic disease and myxomatosis, are affecting European rabbit populations. In this context, we discuss the genetic diversity of the European rabbit immune system and extend to available information about other lagomorphs. Regarding innate immunity, we review the most recent advances in identifying interleukins, chemokines and chemokine receptors, Toll-like receptors, antiviral proteins (RIG-I and Trim5), and the genes encoding fucosyltransferases that are utilized by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus as a portal for invading host respiratory and gut epithelial cells. Evolutionary studies showed that several genes of innate immunity are evolving by strong natural selection. Studies of the leporid CCR5 gene revealed a very dramatic change unique in mammals at the second extracellular loop of CCR5 resulting from a gene conversion event with the paralogous CCR2. For the adaptive immune system, we review genetic diversity at the loci encoding antibody variable and constant regions, the major histocompatibility complex (RLA) and T cells. Studies of IGHV and IGKC genes expressed in leporids are two of the few examples of trans-species polymorphism observed outside of the major histocompatibility complex. In addition, we review some endogenous viruses of lagomorph genomes, the importance of the European rabbit as a model for human disease studies, and the anticipated role of next-generation sequencing in extending knowledge of lagomorph immune systems and their evolution.

"Five hantaviruses are known to circulate among rodents in Europe, and at least two among insectivores. Four (Dobrava, Saaremaa, Seoul, and Puumala [PUUV] viruses) are clearly associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). PUUV, the most common etiological agent of HFRS in Europe, is carried by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus), one of the most widespread and abundant mammal species in Europe. This host-virus system is among hantaviruses also the most studied one in Europe. However, HFRS incidence varies throughout the continent. The spatial as well as temporal variation in the occurrence of HFRS is linked to geographic differences in the population dynamics of the reservoir rodents in different biomes of Europe. While rodent abundance may follow mast seeding events in many parts of temperate Europe, in northern (N) Europe multiannual cycles in population density exist as the result of the interaction between rodent populations and specialist predator populations in a delayed density-dependent manner. The spatial distribution of hantaviruses further depends on parameters such as forest patch size and connectivity of the most suitable rodent habitats, and the conditions for the survival of the virus outside the host, as well as historical distribution patterns (phylogeographies) of hosts and viruses. In multiannually fluctuating populations of rodents, with population increases of great amplitude, one should expect a simultaneous build-up of recently hantavirus-infected (shedding) rodents. The increasing number of infectious, virus-shedding rodents leads to a rapid transmission of hantavirus across the rodent population, and to humans. Our review discusses these aspects for PUUV, the only European hantavirus for which there is a reasonable, yet still far from complete, ecological continental-wide understanding. We discuss how this information could translate to other European hantavirus-host systems, and where the most important questions lie for further research.

"Digital media and digital search tools offer simple and effective means to monitor for pathogens and disease outbreaks in target organisms. Using tools such as Rich Site Summary feeds, and Google News and Google Scholar specific key word searches, international digital media were actively monitored from 2012 to 2016 for pathogens and disease outbreaks in the taxonomic order Lagomorpha, with a specific focus on the European rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus). The primary objective was identifying pathogens for assessment as potential new biocontrol agents for Australia's pest populations of the European rabbit. A number of pathogens were detected in digital media reports. Additional benefits arose in the regular provision of case reports and research on myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus that assisted with current research.

"The UHF fraction from NIL 8 hamster embryo fibroblasts contains the LETS protein and several other major proteins. It exhibits three enzymatic activities in significant amounts: 5'-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphatase, and galactosyl transferase. The latter two appear to be different from the membrane-bound enzymes. This fraction is heavily stained with ruthenium red, a dye specific for the cell coat in intact cells. A comparable fraction from hamster sarcoma virus-transformed cells exhibits a similar overall protein composition but lacks at least three major proteins, including the LETS protein. Compared to NIL 8 cells, the distribution of alkaline phosphatase in fractions from these cells is different, and the level of galactosyl transferase in the UHF is much reduced.

"Certain sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) types are causally associated with the development of cervical cancer. Our recent development of high-titer HPV pseudoviruses has made it possible to perform high-throughput in vitro screens to identify HPV infection inhibitors. Comparison of a variety of compounds revealed that carrageenan, a type of sulfated polysaccharide extracted from red algae, is an extremely potent infection inhibitor for a broad range of sexually transmitted HPVs. Although carrageenan can inhibit herpes simplex viruses and some strains of HIV in vitro, genital HPVs are about a thousand-fold more susceptible, with 50% inhibitory doses in the low ng/ml range. Carrageenan acts primarily by preventing the binding of HPV virions to cells. This finding is consistent with the fact that carrageenan resembles heparan sulfate, an HPV cell-attachment factor. However, carrageenan is three orders of magnitude more potent than heparin, a form of cell-free heparan sulfate that has been regarded as a highly effective model HPV inhibitor. Carrageenan can also block HPV infection through a second, postattachment heparan sulfate-independent effect. Carrageenan is in widespread commercial use as a thickener in a variety of cosmetic and food products, ranging from sexual lubricants to infant feeding formulas. Some of these products block HPV infectivity in vitro, even when diluted a million-fold. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether carrageenan-based products are effective as topical microbicides against genital HPVs.

"RHDV (rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus), a virulent calicivirus, causes high mortalities in European rabbit populations (Oryctolagus cuniculus). It uses α1,2fucosylated glycans, histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), as attachment factors, with their absence or low expression generating resistance to the disease. Synthesis of these glycans requires an α1,2fucosyltransferase. In mammals, there are three closely located α1,2fucosyltransferase genes rSec1, rFut2 and rFut1 that arose through two rounds of duplications. In most mammalian species, Sec1 has clearly become a pseudogene. Yet, in leporids, it does not suffer gross alterations, although we previously observed that rabbit Sec1 variants present either low or no activity. Still, a low activity rSec1 allele correlated with survival to an RHDV outbreak. We now confirm the association between the α1,2fucosyltransferase loci and survival. In addition, we show that rabbits express homogenous rFut1 and rFut2 levels in the small intestine. Comparison of rFut1 and rFut2 activity showed that type 2 A, B and H antigens recognized by RHDV strains were mainly synthesized by rFut1, and all rFut1 variants detected in wild animals were equally active. Interestingly, rSec1 RNA levels were highly variable between individuals and high expression was associated with low binding of RHDV strains to the mucosa. Co-transfection of rFut1 and rSec1 caused a decrease in rFut1-generated RHDV binding sites, indicating that in rabbits, the catalytically inactive rSec1 protein acts as a dominant-negative of rFut1. Consistent with neofunctionalization of Sec1 in leporids, gene conversion analysis showed extensive homogenization between Sec1 and Fut2 in leporids, at variance with its limited degree in other mammals. Gene conversion additionally involving Fut1 was also observed at the C-terminus. Thus, in leporids, unlike in most other mammals where it became extinct, Sec1 evolved a new function with a dominant-negative effect on rFut1, contributing to fucosylated glycan diversity, and allowing herd protection from pathogens such as RHDV.

"Soil passage of (pretreated) surface water to remove pathogenic microorganisms is a highly efficient process under oxic conditions, reducing microorganism concentrations about 8 log(10) within tens of meters. However, under anoxic conditions, it has been shown that removal of microorganisms can be limited very much. Setback distances for adequate protection of natural groundwater may, therefore, be too short if anoxic conditions apply. Because removal of microorganisms under suboxic conditions is unknown, this research investigated removal of bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1 by soil passage under suboxic conditions at field scale. At the field location (dune area), one injection well and six monitoring wells were installed at different depths along three suboxic flow lines, where oxygen concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 mg/l and nitrate concentrations ranged from 13 to 16 mg/L. PRD1 and MS2 were injected directly at the corresponding depths and their removal in each flow line was determined. The highest bacteriophage removal was observed in the top layer, with about 9 log removal of MS2, and 7 log removal of PRD1 after 16 meters of aquifer transport. Less removal was observed at 12 m below surface, probably due to a higher groundwater velocity in this coarser grained layer. MS2 was removed more effectively than PRD1 under all conditions. Due to short travel times, inactivation of the phages was limited and the reported log removal was mainly associated with attachment of phages to the aquifer matrix. This study shows that attachment of MS2 and PRD1 is similar for oxic and suboxic sandy aquifers, and, therefore, setback distances used for sandy aquifers under oxic and suboxic conditions provide a similar level of safety. Sticking efficiency and the attachment rate coefficient, as measures for virus attachment, were evaluated as a function of the physico-chemical conditions.

"Medium from cultures of simian virus 40-transformed mouse 3T3 cells (SV3T3) inhibits the migration in vitro of peritoneal exudate cells (macrophages) from guinea pigs while medium from untransformed 3T3 cultures does not [Hammond, M. E., Robbin, R. D., Dvorak, A. M., Selvaggio, S. S., Black, P. H. & Dvorak, H. F. (1974) Science 185, 955-957]. The present paper describes the generation of migration inhibitory factor (MIF)-like activity for peritoneal exudate cells from guinea pigs after incubation of a serum-free harvest fluid from SV3T3 cells with guinea pig serum. Inhibited macrophages lose a densely staining material from the cell surface coat compared with uninhibited guinea pig peritoneal exudate cells. The factor in SV3T3 harvest fluids which generates the migration inhibitory activity appears to be plasminogen activator, i.e., a serine protease, because (i) plasminogen activator activity and the factor which generates MIF-like activity copurify, and co-chromatograph on Sephadex G-200 columns, and (ii) plasminogen activator activity and capacity to generate MIF-like activity are simultaneously lost upon treatment with [3H]diisopropylfluorophosphate. In addition, a purified preparation of a known plasminogen activator, human urokinase, can also generate MIF-like activity upon reaction with guinea pig serum. Because transformation of 3T3 cells by SV40 increases their plasminogen activator secretion, enhanced secretion of plasminogen activator by SV3T3 cells may explain why formation of MIF-like activity is observed in SV3T3 but not 3T3 cultures. These results reveal a biochemical pathway whereby a product secreted by virus-transformed cells affects one function of a cell central to the host's immunological defense system.

"Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) for gene therapy applications are gaining momentum, with more therapies moving into later stages of clinical development and towards market approval, namely for cancer therapy. The development of cytotoxic vectors is often hampered by side effects arising when non-target cells are infected, and their production can be hindered by toxic effects of the transgene on the producing cell lines. In this study, we evaluated the potential of rAAV-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) to target basal-like breast cancer genetic vulnerabilities. Our results show that by optimizing the stoichiometry of the plasmids upon transfection and time of harvest, it is possible to increase the viral titers and quality. All rAAV-shRNA vectors obtained efficiently transduced the BLBC cell lines MDA-MB-468 and HCC1954. In MDA-MB-468, transduction with rAAV-shRNA vector targeting PSMA2 was associated with significant decrease in cell viability and apoptosis induction. Importantly, rAAV2-PSMA2 also slowed tumor growth in a BLBC mouse xenograft model, thus potentially representing a therapeutic strategy against this type of cancer.

"Neoplasia has long been reported as a rare finding in rabbits, but over the past decades the number of reports on neoplastic disease in rabbits has risen considerably. Similar to other animals, neoplastic changes may occur in any organ system, but the rate in which the organ systems are affected differs considerably. In rabbits, tumors have predominantly been found in the urogenital, hemolymphatic, and integumentary systems. This article discusses current insights on the etiopathogenesis, clinical signs, diagnosis, and treatment of the commonest neoplastic diseases in rabbits and offer guidelines for the correct diagnosis and treatment of the rabbit oncologic patient.

"Enucleation of animal cells in which nuclear fragmentation (micronucleation) has been induced by treatment with mitotic inhibitors results in the formation of subdiploid microcells consisting of one or several micronuclei, some cytoplasm and surrounded by a plasma membrane. Microcells were prepared from rat kangaroo cells (12 chromosomes) and a polyoma virus transformed mouse cell line (61 chromosomes) and analysed for DNA content. Microspectrophotometric DNA measurements and the appearance of micronuclei at mitosis show that small micronuclei contain genetic information equivalent to single chromosomes. A large proportion of the micronuclei and the microcells, however, contains DNA corresponding to several chromosomes. Heterogeneous mixtures of microcells can be fractionated by a unit gravity sedimentation procedure so as to isolate the small microcells. These can afterwards be fused with intact normal or mutant cells.

"The adsorption of poliovirus 3, coxsackievirus B1, and coliphage f2 on soil from an irrigation field loaded for years with waste water and sandy soil from an aquifer was investigated under the influence of two anionic detergents, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) and alkylbenzolsulphonate (ABS). The investigation was carried out through batch and column experiments under simulated conditions. The concentrations of both detergents found generally in surface water (0.2-10 mg/l) had no effect on the adsorption of tested viruses. The concentration of 100 mg/l was the lowest intensity that led to an impaired adsorption of viruses on the sediments. The desorbing effect of SDS was relatively higher than ABS. Both detergents gave rise to a desorption and migration of viruses. Especially in soil from an irrigation field the effect was stronger at pH 7.2 than at pH 5.1. Despite low concentrations of detergents in surface water, such procedures as bank filtration, waste water irrigation for the enrichment of groundwater, and the use of sewage sludge on agricultural fields or forest grounds can cause an accumulation of detergents or their metabolites which impairs the binding of viruses to sediments. Therefore, the danger occurrence of a groundwater contamination with enteroviruses should be considered in those sectors.

"Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a common agent of viral encephalitis that causes high mortality and morbidity among children. Molecular genetic studies of JEV are hampered by the lack of a genetically stable full-length infectious JEV cDNA clone. We describe here the development of such a clone. A JEV isolate was fully sequenced, and then its full-length cDNA was cloned into a bacterial artificial chromosome. This was then further engineered so that transcription of the cDNA in vitro would generate synthetic RNAs with authentic 5' and 3' ends. The synthetic RNAs thus produced were highly infectious in susceptible cells (>10(6) PFU/ micro g), and these cells rapidly generated a high titer of synthetic viruses (>5 x 10(6) PFU/ml). The recovered viruses were indistinguishable from the parental virus in terms of plaque morphology, growth kinetics, RNA accumulation, protein expression, and cytopathogenicity. Significantly, the structural and functional integrity of the cDNA was maintained even after 180 generations of growth in Escherichia coli. A single point mutation acting as a genetic marker was introduced into the cDNA and was found in the genome of the recovered virus, indicating that the cDNA can be manipulated. Furthermore, we showed that JEV is an attractive vector for the expression of heterologous genes in a wide variety of cell types. This novel reverse genetics system for JEV will greatly facilitate research into JEV biology. It will also be useful as a heterologous gene expression vector and will aid the development of a vaccine against JEV.

"During 10 spring and summer seasons (1992-2001), the dynamics of the epizootic process in natural foci were studied in taiga forests of the Pre-Ural region, Russia. In these foci, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus circulate transmitted by their main vector tick, Ixodes persulcatus. Main parameters of the epizootic process were calculated for each season. In three seasons (1993, 1996, and 1999) all parameters characterizing the abundance of unfed nymphs and adult ticks, as well as the prevalence of Borrelia and TBE virus in them, increased sharply and simultaneously. These seasons were preceded by years of population peaks in forest rodents (1992, 1995, and 1998), especially Clethrionomys glareolus voles, the dominant species in the local mammalian fauna. Apparently, the possibility of horizontal transmission of the agents of tick-borne infections sharply increases in such years and this results in the intensification of their dissemination.

"Muscle hypertrophy is the product of increased drive through protein synthetic pathways and the incorporation of newly divided satellite cells. Gains in muscle mass and strength can be achieved through exercise regimens that include resistance training. Increased insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) can also promote hypertrophy through increased protein synthesis and satellite cell proliferation. However, it is not known whether the combined effect of IGF-I and resistance training results in an additive hypertrophic response. Therefore, rats in which viral administration of IGF-I was directed to one limb were subjected to ladder climbing to test the interaction of each intervention on muscle mass and strength. After 8 wk of resistance training, a 23.3% increase in muscle mass and a 14.4% increase in peak tetanic tension (P(o)) were observed in the flexor hallucis longus (FHL). Viral expression of IGF-I without resistance training produced a 14.8% increase in mass and a 16.6% increase in P(o) in the FHL. The combined interventions produced a 31.8% increase in muscle mass and a 28.3% increase in P(o) in the FHL. Therefore, the combination of resistance training and overexpression of IGF-I induced greater hypertrophy than either treatment alone. The effect of increased IGF-I expression on the loss of muscle mass associated with detraining was also addressed. FHL muscles treated with IGF-I lost only 4.8% after detraining, whereas the untreated FHL lost 8.3% muscle mass. These results suggest that a combination of resistance training and overexpression of IGF-I could be an effective measure for attenuating the loss of training-induced adaptations.

"Viral diseases, whether of animals or humans, are normally considered as problems to be managed. However, in Australia, two viruses have been used as landscape-scale therapeutics to control European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), the preeminent invasive vertebrate pest species. Rabbits have caused major environmental and agricultural losses and contributed to extinction of native species. It was not until the introduction of Myxoma virus that effective control of this pest was obtained at a continental scale. Subsequent coevolution of rabbit and virus saw a gradual reduction in the effectiveness of biological control that was partially ameliorated by the introduction of the European rabbit flea to act as an additional vector for the virus. In 1995, a completely different virus, Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), escaped from testing and spread through the Australian rabbit population and again significantly reduced rabbit numbers and environmental impacts. The evolutionary pressures on this virus appear to be producing quite different outcomes to those that occurred with myxoma virus and the emergence and invasion of a novel genotype of RHDV in 2014 have further augmented control. Molecular studies on myxoma virus have demonstrated multiple proteins that manipulate the host innate and adaptive immune response; however the molecular basis of virus attenuation and reversion to virulence are not yet understood.

"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized.

"The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is a host factor with potent antiviral activity when overexpressed in cells. ZAP blocks replication of the prototype alphavirus Sindbis virus (SINV) at a step at or before translation of the incoming viral genome. The mechanism of ZAP anti-SINV activity and the determinants of its antiviral function, however, have not been defined. Here, we have identified a dominant negative inhibitor of human ZAP. Rat ZAP with a cysteine-to-arginine mutation at position 88 (rZAPC88R), previously reported as a nonfunctional form of ZAP, increases SINV growth in cells. These results led us to discover a previously undetectable pool of endogenous functional ZAP within human cells. Investigation of the mechanism of dominant negative inhibition, combined with a comprehensive mutational analysis of the antiviral factor, revealed that homotypic associations are required for ZAP function in limiting SINV propagation.

"BACKGROUND: In chronic rejection, parenchymal fibrosis and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) characterized by neointimal growth are the leading causes of graft loss for heart transplant recipients. During alloimmune responses a variety of cytokines, adhesion proteins, and growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), are up-regulated. The PDGF family (AA, AB, BB, CC, DD), which acts mainly on connective tissue cells, is considered to be a potent mitogenic and chemotactic factor for fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle cells. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PDGF ligands in chronic rejection. METHODS: Heterotopic heart transplantations were performed between fully major histocompatability complex-mismatched Dark Agouti to Wistar Furth rats receiving cyclosporine immunosuppression. Allograft coronary arteries were perfused with a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as a control gene or PDGF-A, -B, -C, -D. Allografts were harvested at 100 days for morphometric analysis of CAV and fibrosis. RESULTS: AAV-mediated transgene expression was detected by EGFP immunoreactivity across the graft section (at 100 days) in AAV EGFP-perfused allografts. AAV PDGF-A, -C, and -D perfusion resulted in accelerated CAV and fibrosis. In contrast, AAV PDGF-B perfusion did not induce arteriosclerotic changes or fibrosis in cardiac allografts. CONCLUSIONS: AAV PDGF-A, -C, and -D overexpression accelerated the development of chronic rejection, whereas PDGF-B did not. Our results suggested that more targeted therapy with monoclonal antibodies blocking the active sites of PDGF-A, -C, and -D may produce beneficial effects on heart transplant survival.

"Black coat color (nonagouti) is a widespread classical mutation in laboratory mouse strains. The intronic insertion of endogenous retrovirus VL30 in the nonagouti (a) allele of agouti gene was previously reported as the cause of the nonagouti phenotype. Here, we report agouti mouse strains from East Asia that carry the VL30 insertion, indicating that VL30 alone does not cause the nonagouti phenotype. We find that a rare type of endogenous retrovirus, β4, was integrated into the VL30 region at the a allele through nested retrotransposition, causing abnormal splicing. Targeted complete deletion of the β4 element restores agouti gene expression and agouti coat color, whereas deletion of β4 except for a single long terminal repeat results in black-and-tan coat color. Phylogenetic analyses show that the a allele and the β4 retrovirus originated from an East Asian mouse lineage most likely related to Japanese fancy mice. These findings reveal the causal mechanism and historic origin of the classical nonagouti mutation.

"The movement function of poa semilatent hordeivirus (PSLV) is mediated by the triple gene block (TGB) proteins, of which two, TGBp2 and TGBp3, are membrane proteins. TGBp3 is localized to peripheral bodies in the vicinity of the plasma membrane and is able to re-direct TGBp2 from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the peripheral bodies. For imaging of TGBp3-mediated protein targeting, PSLV TGBp3 tagged with a red fluorescent protein (DsRed) was used. Coexpression of DsRed-TGBp3 with GFP targeted to the ER lumen (ER-GFP) demonstrated that ER-GFP was contained in typical ER structures and peripheral bodies formed by TGBp3 protein, suggesting an ER origin for these bodies. In transient coexpression with viral membrane proteins tagged with GFP, DsRed-TGBp3 directed to the peripheral bodies the homologous TGBp2 protein and two unrelated membrane proteins, the 6 kDa movement protein of beet yellows closterovirus and the putative movement protein encoded by the genome component 4 of faba bean necrotic yellows nanovirus. However, coexpression of TGBp3 with GFP derivatives targeted to the ER membranes by artificial hydrophobic tail sequences suggested that targeting to the ER membranes per se was not sufficient for TGBp3-directed protein trafficking to peripheral bodies. TGBp3-induced targeting of TGBp2 also occurred in mammalian cells, indicating the universal nature of the protein trafficking signals and the cotargeting mechanism.

"We describe a self-amplifying feedback loop that autoinduces Skp2 during G1 phase progression. This loop, which contains Skp2 itself, p27(kip1) (p27), cyclin E-cyclin dependent kinase 2, and the retinoblastoma protein, is closed through a newly identified, conserved E2F site in the Skp2 promoter. Interference with the loop, by knockin of a Skp2-resistant p27 mutant (p27(T187A)), delays passage through the restriction point but does not interfere with S phase entry under continuous serum stimulation. Skp2 knock down inhibits S phase entry in nontransformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts but not in human papilloma virus-E7 expressing fibroblasts. We propose that the essential role for Skp2-dependent degradation of p27 is in the formation of an autoinduction loop that selectively controls the transition to mitogen-independence, and that Skp2-dependent proteolysis may be dispensable when pocket proteins are constitutively inactivated.

"The purpose of this study was to define the taxonomic relationship of an arenavirus principally associated with the southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus) in southern Texas to other New World arenaviruses. The results of independent analyses of glycoprotein precursor amino acid sequences and nucleocapsid protein amino acid sequences indicated that the arenavirus in southern Texas is novel (proposed species name Catarina virus) and phylogenetically most closely related to Whitewater Arroyo virus, which is principally associated with the white-throated woodrat (Neotoma albigula) in northwestern New Mexico. Together, the close phylogenetic relationship between Catarina virus and Whitewater Arroyo virus and the association of these viral species with congeneric rodent species support the notion that the principal host relationships of some New World arenaviruses are a product of a long-term shared evolutionary relationship between the virus family Arenaviridae and the rodent family Cricetidae.

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease is a viral disease that emerged in the 1980s and causes high mortality and morbidity in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In 2010, a new genotype of the rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus emerged and replaced the former circulating Lagovirus europaeus/GI.1 strains. Several recombination events have been reported for the new genotype Lagovirus europaeus/GI.2, with pathogenic (variants GI.1a and GI.1b) and benign (genotype GI.4) strains that served as donors for the non-structural part while GI.2 composed the structural part; another recombination event has also been described at the p16/p23 junction involving GI.4 strains. In this study, we analysed new complete coding sequences of four benign GI.3 strains and four GI.2 strains. Phylogenetic and recombination detection analyses revealed that the first GI.2 strains, considered as non-recombinant, resulted from a recombination event between GI.3 and GI.2, with GI.3 as the major donor for the non-structural part and GI.2 for the structural part. Our results indicate that recombination contributed to the emergence, persistence and dissemination of GI.2 as a pathogenic form and that all described GI.2 strains so far are the product of recombination. This highlights the need to study full-genomic sequences of lagoviruses to understand their emergence and evolution.

"Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal disease. Excessive accumulation of tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype are two main contributors to drug resistance in desmoplastic pancreatic tumors. To overcome desmoplasia and chemoresistance of pancreatic cancer, we utilized an oncolytic adenovirus (Ad) co-expressing decorin and soluble Wnt decoy receptor (HEmT-DCN/sLRP6). An orthotopic pancreatic xenograft tumor model was established in athymic nude mice using Mia PaCa-2 cells, and the antimetastatic and antitumor efficacy of systemically administered HEmT-DCN/sLRP6 was evaluated. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues was performed to assess ECM degradation, induction of apoptosis, viral dispersion, and inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. HEmT-DCN/sLRP6 effectively degraded tumor ECM and inhibited EMT, leading to enhanced viral distribution, induction of apoptosis, and attenuation of tumor cell proliferation in tumor tissue. HEmT-DCN/sLRP6 prevented metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Importantly, HEmT-DCN/sLRP6 sensitized pancreatic tumor to gemcitabine treatment. Furthermore, HEmT-DCN/sLRP6 augmented drug penetration and dispersion within pancreatic tumor xenografts and patient-derived tumor spheroids. Collectively, these results illustrate that HEmT-DCN/sLRP6 can enhance the dispersion of both oncolytic Ad and a chemotherapeutic agent in chemoresistant and desmoplastic pancreatic tumor, effectively overcoming the preexisting limitations of standard treatments.

"Four strains of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus isolated in the Irkutsk region were shown by the agar gel diffusion and precipitation test with adsorbed sera to comprise a single antigenic group differing from members of the eastern and western TBE virus serotypes (Sophyin and 256 strains). The group includes the strains isolated during 20 years (1960 - 1980) from patients with chronic TBE form (Aina/1448 and 763 strains), from the brain of root vole (Microtus oeconomus Pall) (strain 147), and from Ix. persulcatus ticks (Irkutsk-6 strain). The clonal analysis showed the Aina/1448 strain population to be antigenically homogeneous.

"Methods of study of tumour invasiveness in vitro were investigated using the interactions between malignant virally transformed C3H mouse fibroblasts (MO4) with fragments from embryonic chick heart. Invasion of MO4 cells into the heart tissue could be demonstrated in all three-dimensional cultures. On the contrary, seeding of MO4 cells on top of a monolayer of heart cells did not mimic invasion. Precultured heart fragments were more suitable for the study of the early phase of invasion than freshly cut ones because they presented healthy well-delineated borders. Aggregates of MO4 cells proved more suitable than suspensions or monolayer fragments because they were amenable to quantitation, were not traumatized or treated with enzymes during harvest. They allowed precise control of the initial site of contact with the heart tissue. The nature of the culture medium predominantly affected the growth of the MO4 population. This factor influenced the pattern of invasion quantitatively, but did not alter the invasive capacity of the MO4 cells itself. In cultures on adhesive substrates the interaction between the MO4 cells and the heart tissue was complicated by the fact that both also interacted with the aritficial substrate. Shaker cultures appeared better than comparable static cultures because they allowed better aeration and so delayed central necrosis.

"In December 1993, a light-trap survey was made of the Culicoides found at eight horse stables and dairies in the sandy dune field west of Port Elizabeth, South Africa. While it was notable that Culicoides numbers were low (4749) and that the diversity was poor (15 species), the most remarkable fact to emerge, was that C. imicola, the only proven vector of the virus of African horse sickness (AHS), was entirely absent. Though not abundant, C. bolitinos, a sister species of C. imicola, was overwhelmingly dominant (91.7%). Its larvae and pupae develop exclusively in the dung of cattle, but it is a species that is not implicated in the transmission of animal viruses. Elsewhere in South Africa, a frost-free climate, good rainfall and a plentiful supply of livestock would normally lead to the development of large foci of C. imicola. That this is not the case in the Port Elizabeth (P.E.) area is most likely owing to the winds inhibiting adult flight and the sandy soils being nutrient-poor and too well-drained to sustain Culicoides larvae. Studies are needed to confirm that sandy soils cannot sustain C. imicola. If so, the sandy coastal areas hold promise for quarantining against AHS.

"We describe here a novel platform technology for the discovery of small molecule mimetics of conformational epitopes on protein antigens. As a model system, we selected mimetics of a conserved hydrophobic pocket within the N-heptad repeat region of the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp41. The human monoclonal antibody, D5, binds to this target and exhibits broadly neutralizing activity against HIV-1. We exploited the antigen-binding property of D5 to select complementary small molecules using a high throughput screen of a diverse chemical collection. The resulting small molecule leads were rendered immunogenic by linking them to a carrier protein and were shown to elicit N-heptad repeat-binding antibodies in a fraction of immunized mice. Plasma from HIV-1-infected subjects shown previously to contain broadly neutralizing antibodies was found to contain antibodies capable of binding to haptens represented in the benzylpiperidine leads identified as a result of the high throughput screen, further validating these molecules as vaccine leads. Our results suggest a new paradigm for vaccine discovery using a medicinal chemistry approach to identify lead molecules that, when optimized, could become vaccine candidates for infectious diseases that have been refractory to conventional vaccine development.

"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is widely favored as a gene therapy vector, tested in over 200 clinical trials internationally. To improve targeted delivery a variety of genetic capsid modifications, such as insertion of targeting proteins/peptides into the capsid shell, have been explored with some success but larger insertions often have unpredictable deleterious impacts on capsid formation and gene delivery. Here, we demonstrate a modular platform for the integration of exogenous peptides and proteins onto the AAV capsid post-translationally while preserving vector functionality. We decorated the AAV capsid with leucine-zipper coiled-coil binding motifs that exhibit specific noncovalent heterodimerization. AAV capsids successfully display hexahistidine tagged-peptides using this approach, as demonstrated through nickel column affinity. This protein display platform may facilitate the incorporation of biological moieties on the AAV surface, expanding possibilities for vector enhancement and engineering.

"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the most common S. enterica serovars associated with U.S. foodborne outbreaks. S. Typhimurium bacteria isolated from humans exhibit wide-ranging virulence phenotypes in inbred mice, leading to speculation that some strains are more virulent in nature. However, it is unclear whether increased virulence in humans is related to organism characteristics or initial treatment failure due to antibiotic resistance. Strain diversity and genetic factors contributing to differential human pathogenicity remain poorly understood. We reconstructed phylogeny, resolved genetic population structure, determined gene content and nucleotide variants, and conducted targeted phenotyping assays for S. Typhimurium strains collected between 1946 and 2012 from humans and animals in the United States and abroad. Strains from recent U.S. salmonellosis cases were associated with five S. Typhimurium lineages distributed within three phylogenetic clades, which are not restricted by geography, year of acquisition, or host. Notably, two U.S. strains and four Mexican strains are more closely related to strains associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa than to other North American strains. Phenotyping studies linked variants specific to these strains in hmpA and katE to loss of fitness under nitrosative and oxidative stress, respectively. These results suggest that U.S. salmonellosis is caused by diverse S. Typhimurium strains circulating worldwide. One lineage has mutations in genes affecting fitness related to innate immune system strategies for fighting pathogens and may be adapting to immunocompromised humans by a reduction in virulence capability, possibly due to a lack of selection for its maintenance as a result of the worldwide HIV epidemic. IMPORTANCE: Nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteria cause an estimated 1.2 million illnesses annually in the United States, 80 million globally, due to ingestion of contaminated food or water. Salmonella Typhimurium is one of the most common serovars associated with foodborne illness, causing self-limiting gastroenteritis and, in approximately 5% of infected patients, systemic infection. Although some S. Typhimurium strains are speculated to be more virulent than others, it is unknown how strain diversity and genetic factors contribute to differential human pathogenicity. Ours is the first study to examine the diversity of S. Typhimurium associated with recent cases of U.S. salmonellosis and to provide some initial correlation between observed genotypes and phenotypes. Definition of specific S. Typhimurium lineages based on such phenotype/genotype correlations may identify strains with greater capability of associating with specific food sources, allowing outbreaks to be more quickly identified. Additionally, defining simple correlates of pathogenesis may have predictive value for patient outcome.

"Recently, self-replicating RNA vaccines (RNA replicons) have emerged as an effective strategy for nucleic acid vaccine development. Unlike naked DNA vaccines, RNA replicons eventually cause lysis of transfected cells and therefore do not raise the concern of integration into the host genome. We evaluated the effect of linking human papillomavirus type 16 E7 as a model Ag to Mycobacterium tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) on the potency of Ag-specific immunity generated by a Sindbis virus self-replicating RNA vector, SINrep5. Our results indicated that this RNA replicon vaccine containing an E7/HSP70 fusion gene generated significantly higher E7-specific T cell-mediated immune responses in vaccinated mice than did vaccines containing the wild-type E7 gene. Furthermore, our in vitro studies demonstrated that E7 Ag from E7/HSP70 RNA replicon-transfected cells can be processed by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and presented more efficiently through the MHC class I pathway than can wild-type E7 RNA replicon-transfected cells. More importantly, the fusion of HSP70 to E7 converted a less effective vaccine into one with significant potency against E7-expressing tumors. This antitumor effect was dependent on NK cells and CD8(+) T cells. These results indicated that fusion of HSP70 to an Ag gene may greatly enhance the potency of self-replicating RNA vaccines.

"BACKGROUND: Due to the migratory flow of infected people with severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS COV-2), the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is accelerating globally; preclinical evidence of antiviral agents that can combat this pandemic is still elusive. We identified published articles on SARS-COV efficacy experiments in which some selected compounds were used to test the reduction of the virus load in mice. METHODS: A systematic search of articles was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. We then developed a combined model based on a systematic review, meta-analyses, and molecular docking studies to evaluate the effect size of preclinical studies of compounds that have been tested against SARS-COV. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random effect model meta-analyses were carried out to estimate the overall pooled disease's prevalence. All meta-analyses were performed with Stata version 15.0. Subgroup analyses on therapies were conducted as well. Molecular docking studies of the inhibitors in the active pocket of COVID-19 protease were also performed. RESULTS: From all screened articles, six studies were appropriate for ultimate meta-analysis and systematic review. The residual amount of heterogeneity was high (τ(2) =0.02; heterogeneity I(2) =85.5 % with heterogeneity chi-square =103.57, a degree of freedom =15, and p <0.001). The overall random pooled prevalence of infected mice treated with the selected compounds was 78.1 % [95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 14.7-17.0 %]. Prophylactic has a significantly higher pooled prevalence than therapeutic, with 21.8 % (95 % CI: 16.4 % to 28.8 %). Our results indicated that most of the SARS-COV inhibitors analyzed were less effective in reducing the lung virus titer of SARS-COV infection in animal models. The findings from molecular docking studies also identified COVID-19 inhibitors that are good for optimization and drug development to fight against COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the review showed that studies on the preclinical compounds targeting SARS-COV and COVID-19 are limited. Furthermore, molecular docking studies and meta-analysis results substantiated three compounds, i.e., EIDD-2801, GS-5734, and amodiaquine. HIPPOKRATIA 2020, 24(3): 99-106.

"TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins primarily function as ubiquitin E3 ligases that regulate the innate immune response to infection. TRIM25 [also known as Efp (oestrogen-responsive finger protein)] has been implicated in the regulation of oestrogen receptor α signalling and in the regulation of innate immune signalling via RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene-I). RIG-I senses cytosolic viral RNA and is subsequently ubiquitinated by TRIM25 at its N-terminal CARDs (caspase recruitment domains), leading to type I interferon production. The interaction with RIG-I is dependent on the TRIM25 B30.2 domain, a protein-interaction domain composed of the PRY and SPRY tandem sequence motifs. In the present study we describe the 1.8 Å crystal structure of the TRIM25 B30.2 domain, which exhibits a typical B30.2/SPRY domain fold comprising two N-terminal α-helices, thirteen β-strands arranged into two β-sheets and loop regions of varying lengths. A comparison with other B30.2/SPRY structures and an analysis of the loop regions identified a putative binding pocket, which is likely to be involved in binding target proteins. This was supported by mutagenesis and functional analyses, which identified two key residues (Asp(488) and Trp(621)) in the TRIM25 B30.2 domain as being critical for binding to the RIG-I CARDs.

"Histopathological lesions due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) and European brown hare syndrome (EBHS) were studied in 35 rabbits and seven hares. Both rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and hares (Lepus europeus) regularly showed severe necrotizing hepatitis. In RHD, coagulation necrosis, mainly confined to the periphery of the lobules, was consistently found. In EBHS, lytic necrosis affecting the whole lobule was conspicuous, at least in severe cases. Particularly in EBHS, necrotic hepatocytes exhibited a special kind of karyorrhexis. In rabbits with a subacute or subclinical form of disease, early liver cirrhosis was observed. Depletion of lymphocytes was a regular feature in spleens of rabbits and was frequently found in hares. In RHD, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and haemorrhages in different organs, especially in kidneys and lungs were constant findings. DIC was never seen in EBHS and haemorrhages were an infrequent finding.

"We have attempted to purify envelope (Env) glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from the culture supernatants of CHO-Sec cells that secreted truncated 140-kDa precursor and mature 120-kDa Env glycoproteins. The concentrated culture supernatants were applied to a column coupled with cibacron blue 3GA (CB3GA) to separate albumin from the Env proteins because CB3GA, a triazine dye, has been known to have a high affinity to albumin. Unexpectedly, Env proteins as well as albumin bound to the column, and the bound Env proteins were eluted by increasing the ionic strength using KCl. Gp120 was eluted at 0.5-0.9 M of KCl, while a higher concentration (0.9-1.5 M) was necessary for the elution of gp140. The agarose gel coupled with reactive red 120 (RR120), another triazine dye with similar characteristics, also retained both Env proteins, and the bound Env proteins could be eluted in a similar manner. In addition, these agents inhibited syncytium formation caused by HTLV-IIIB and HTLV-IIIMN. Inhibition was also seen when a virus-free fusion assay between Env protein expressed in CHO cells and fluorescent labeled SupT1 cells were used. These findings indicate that triazine dyes bind to the functional regions of Env proteins of HIV-1 that play important role(s) for HIV infection.

"To date information on rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) in Spain and Portugal has been scarce, although the disease is endemic and continues to have a considerable impact on species conservation and hunting industry. We analysed RHDVs obtained between 1994 and 2007 at different geographic locations in Portugal (40 samples), Spain (3 samples) and France (4 samples) from wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) that succumbed to the disease. Phylogenetic analyses based on partial VP60 gene sequences allowed a grouping of these RHDVs into three groups, termed ""Iberian"" Groups IB1, IB2 and IB3. Interestingly, these three Iberian groups clustered separately, though not far from earlier RHDVs of Genogroup 1 (containing e.g., strain ""AST89""), but clearly distinct from globally described RHDV strains of Genogroups 2-6. This result, supported by a bootstrap value of 76%, gives rise to the hypothesis that the virus evolved independently since its introduction to wild rabbit populations on the Iberian Peninsula, with the Pyrenees acting as a natural barrier to rabbit and hence to virus dispersal. No differences were observed in RHDV sequences obtained from geographic regions where the rabbit subspecies O. c. algirus prevails compared with those obtained from O. c. cuniculus.

"Finland has the highest incidence of hantavirus infections globally, with a significant impact on public health. The large coverage of boreal forests and the cyclic dynamics of the dominant forest rodent species, the bank vole Myodes glareolus, explain most of this. We review the relationships between Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), its host rodent, and the hantavirus disease, nephropathia epidemica (NE), in Finland. We describe the history of NE and its diagnostic research in Finland, the seasonal and multiannual cyclic dynamics of PUUV in bank voles impacting human epidemiology, and we compare our northern epidemiological patterns with those in temperate Europe. The long survival of PUUV outside the host and the life-long shedding of PUUV by the bank voles are highlighted. In humans, the infection has unique features in pathobiology but rarely long-term consequences. NE is affected by specific host genetics and risk behavior (smoking), and certain biomarkers can predict the outcome. Unlike many other hantaviruses, PUUV causes a relatively mild disease and is rarely fatal. Reinfections do not exist. Antiviral therapy is complicated by the fact that when symptoms appear, the patient already has a generalized infection. Blocking vascular leakage measures counteracting pathobiology, offer a real therapeutic approach.

"Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) functions as damage-associated molecular pattern and has been demonstrated to be responsible in part for the damage occurring after renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). A short peptide derived from CIRP, named C23, binds to myeloid differentiation factor 2, a Toll-like receptor 4 coreceptor. We hypothesize that C23 reduces renal ischemia-reperfusion (RIR) injury by blocking CIRP. We observed that pretreatment with C23 significantly decreased the levels of recombinant mouse CIRP-induced tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in a dose-dependent fashion in cultured macrophages. C57BL/6 mice were subjected to bilateral renal pedicle clamps for 35 min to induce ischemia, followed by reperfusion for 24 h and harvest of blood and renal tissue. C23 peptide (8 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally at the beginning of reperfusion. Plasma TNF-α, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and IL-6 levels were decreased in C23-treated RIR mice as compared with vehicle-treated mice by 74%, 85%, and 68%, respectively. Expressions of TNF-α and keratinocyte chemoattractant in the kidneys from C23-treated mice were decreased by 55% and 60%, respectively. Expression of kidney injury molecule-1 and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin in the kidney of C23-treated mice were significantly reduced by 46% and 55%, respectively. Renal tissue histological assessments revealed significant reduction in damage score by 44% in C23-treated mice. Finally, a survival study revealed a significant survival advantage with a 70% survival rate in C23 group vs. 37% in vehicle group. Thus, C23 has potential as a novel therapy for the patients suffering from I/R-induced renal injury.

"The retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the related pocket proteins, p107 and p130, play crucial roles in mammalian cell cycle control. Recent studies indicate that these pocket proteins are also involved in cellular differentiation processes. We demonstrate in this work that the pRB-related p130 selectively accumulates during the in vitro differentiation of the myeloid progenitor cell, 32Dcl3, into granulocyte in response to granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). This G-CSF-dependent granulocytic differentiation is blocked by the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein, which binds to and inactivates the pRB family of pocket proteins including p130. Furthermore, enforced overexpression of p130 but not pRB inhibits the myeloid cell proliferation that is concomitantly associated with granulocytic differentiation morphologically characterized by nuclear segmentation. However, simple G1-cell cycle arrest induced by cytokine deprivation or ectopic overexpression of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, or inhibition of E2F activities by dominant negative DP-1 is not sufficient to trigger granulocytic differentiation. The differentiation-promoting activity of p130 in myeloid cells requires both the pocket domain and the spacer domain. Our results indicate that the pRB-related p130 plays a critical role in myeloid cell differentiation and suggest that coupling of cell cycle exit with the cellular differentiation program may be specifically achieved by p130.

"Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules interact with self and foreign peptides of diverse amino acid sequences yet exhibit distinct allele-specific selectivity for peptide binding. The structures of the peptide-binding specificity pockets (subsites) in the groove of murine H-2Kb as well as human histocompatibility antigen class I molecules have been analyzed. Deep but highly conserved pockets at each end of the groove bind the amino and carboxyl termini of peptide through extensive hydrogen bonding and, hence, dictate the orientation of peptide binding. A deep polymorphic pocket in the middle of the groove provides the chemical and structural complementarity for one of the peptide's anchor residues, thereby playing a major role in allele-specific peptide binding. Although one or two shallow pockets in the groove may also interact with specific peptide side chains, their role in the selection of peptide is minor. Thus, usage of a limited number of both deep and shallow pockets in multiple combinations appears to allow the binding of a broad range of peptides. This binding occurs with high affinity, primarily because of extensive interactions with the peptide backbone and the conserved hydrogen bonding network at both termini of the peptide. Interactions between the anchor residue (or residues) and the corresponding allele-specific pocket provide sufficient extra binding affinity not only to enhance specificity but also to endure the presentation of the peptide at the cell surface for recognition by T cells.

"Mammalian ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily F member 3 (ABCF3) is a class 2 ABC protein that has previously been identified as a partner of the mouse flavivirus resistance protein 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase 1B (OAS1B). The functions and natural substrates of ABCF3 are not known. In this study, analysis of purified ABCF3 showed that it is an active ATPase, and binding analyses with a fluorescent ATP analog suggested unequal contributions by the two nucleotide-binding domains. We further showed that ABCF3 activity is increased by lipids, including sphingosine, sphingomyelin, platelet-activating factor, and lysophosphatidylcholine. However, cholesterol inhibited ABCF3 activity, whereas alkyl ether lipids either inhibited or resulted in a biphasic response, suggesting small changes in lipid structure differentially affect ABCF3 activity. Point mutations in the two nucleotide-binding domains of ABCF3 affected sphingosine-stimulated ATPase activity differently, further supporting different roles for the two catalytic pockets. We propose a model in which pocket 1 is the site of basal catalysis, whereas pocket 2 engages in ligand-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. Co-localization of the ABCF3-OAS1B complex to the virus-remodeled endoplasmic reticulum membrane has been shown before. We also noted that co-expression of ABCF3 and OAS1B in bacteria alleviated growth inhibition caused by expression of OAS1B alone, and ABCF3 significantly enhanced OAS1B levels, indirectly showing interaction between these two proteins in bacterial cells. As viral RNA synthesis requires large amounts of ATP, we conclude that lipid-stimulated ATP hydrolysis may contribute to the reduction in viral RNA production characteristic of the flavivirus resistance phenotype.

"GLUT-4 is the major facilitative glucose transporter isoform in tissues that exhibit insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Insulin regulates glucose transport by the rapid translocation of GLUT-4 from an intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. A critical feature of this process is the efficient exclusion of GLUT-4 from the plasma membrane in the absence of insulin. To identify the amino acid domains of GLUT-4 which confer intracellular sequestration, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of chimeric glucose transporters comprised of GLUT-4 and a homologous isoform, GLUT-1, which is found predominantly at the cell surface. These chimeric transporters were transiently expressed in CHO cells using a double subgenomic recombinant Sindbis virus vector. We have found that wild-type GLUT-4 is targeted to an intracellular compartment in CHO cells which is morphologically similar to that observed in adipocytes and muscle cells. Sindbis virus-produced GLUT-1 was predominantly expressed at the cell surface. Substitution of the GLUT-4 amino-terminal region with that of GLUT-1 abolished the efficient intracellular sequestration of GLUT-4. Conversely, substitution of the NH2 terminus of GLUT-1 with that of GLUT-4 resulted in marked intracellular sequestration of GLUT-1. These data indicate that the NH2-terminus of GLUT-4 is both necessary and sufficient for intracellular sequestration.

"The emergence of antibiotic resistance and viruses with high epidemic potential made unexplored marine environments an appealing target source for new metabolites. Marine fungi represent one of the most suitable sources for the discovery of new compounds. Thus, the aim of this work was (i) to isolate and identify fungi associated with the Atlantic sponge Grantia compressa; (ii) to study the fungal metabolites by applying the OSMAC approach (one strain; many compounds); (iii) to test fungal compounds for their antimicrobial activities. Twenty-one fungal strains (17 taxa) were isolated from G. compressa. The OSMAC approach revealed an astonishing metabolic diversity in the marine fungus Eurotium chevalieri MUT 2316, from which 10 compounds were extracted, isolated, and characterized. All metabolites were tested against viruses and bacteria (reference and multidrug-resistant strains). Dihydroauroglaucin completely inhibited the replication of influenza A virus; as for herpes simplex virus 1, total inhibition of replication was observed for both physcion and neoechinulin D. Six out of 10 compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria with isodihydroauroglaucin being the most promising compound (minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 4-64 µg/mL) with bactericidal activity. Overall, G. compressa proved to be an outstanding source of fungal diversity. Marine fungi were capable of producing different metabolites; in particular, the compounds isolated from E. chevalieri showed promising bioactivity against well-known and emerging pathogens.

"The risk for contamination of potatoes and groundwater through subsurface drip irrigation with low quality water was explored in 30 large-scale lysimeters containing repacked coarse sand and sandy loam soils. The human pathogens, Salmonella Senftenberg, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli O157:H7, and the virus indicator Salmonella Typhimurium bacteriophage 28B, were added weekly through irrigation tubes for one month with low irrigation rates (8 mm per week). In the following six months lysimeters were irrigated with groundwater free of pathogens. Two weeks after irrigation was started, phage 28B was detected in low concentrations (2 pfu ml(-1)) in leachate from both sandy loam soil and coarse sand lysimeters. After 27 days, phage 28B continued to be present in similar concentrations in leachate from lysimeters containing coarse sand, while no phage were found in lysimeters with sandy loam soil. The added bacterial pathogens were not found in any leachate samples during the entire study period of 212 days. Under the study conditions with repacked soil, limited macropores and low water velocity, bacterial pathogens seemed to be retained in the soil matrix and died-off before leaching to groundwater. However, viruses may leach to groundwater and represent a health risk as for some viruses only few virus particles are needed to cause human disease. The bacterial pathogens and the phage 28B were found on the potato samples harvested just after the application of microbial tracers was terminated. The findings of bacterial pathogens and phage 28 on all potato samples suggest that the main risk associated with subsurface drip irrigation with low quality water is faecal contamination of root crops, in particular those consumed raw.

"The crystal structure of the mouse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule H-2Dd with an immunodominant peptide, designated P18-I10 (RGPGRAFVTI), from human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein 120 was determined at 3.2 A resolution. A novel orientation of the alpha3 domain of Dd relative to the alpha1/alpha2 domains results in significantly fewer contacts between alpha3 and beta2-microglobulin compared with other MHC class I proteins. Four out of ten peptide residues (P2 Gly, P3 Pro, P5 Arg and P10 Ile) are nearly completely buried in the Dd binding groove. This is consistent with previous findings that Dd exploits a four-residue binding motif comprising a glycine at P2, a proline at P3, a positively charged residue at P5, and a C-terminal hydrophobic residue at P9 or P10. The side-chain of P5 Arg is directed toward the floor of the predominantly hydrophobic binding groove where it forms two salt bridges and one hydrogen bond with Dd residue Asp77. The selection of glycine at P2 appears to be due to a narrowing of the B pocket, relative to that of other class I molecules, caused by Arg66 whose side-chain folds down into the binding cleft. Residue P3 Pro of P18-I10 occupies part of pocket D, which in Dd is partially split by a prominent hydrophobic ridge in the floor of the binding groove formed by Trp97 and Trp114. Residues P6 through P9 form a solvent-exposed bulge, with P7 Phe protruding the most from the binding groove and thereby probably constituting a major site of interaction with T cell receptors. A comparison of H-2Dd/P18-I10 with other MHC class I/peptide complexes of known structure provides insights into the possible basis for the specificity of the natural killer cell receptor Ly-49A for several related class I molecules.

"Myxoma virus in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is one of the best documented examples of host-virus co-evolution. In the natural hosts (Sylvilagus brasiliensis or S. bachmani rabbits in the Americas), myxoma virus causes a benign cutaneous fibroma. In European rabbits, however, myxoma virus causes the fulminant disease, myxomatosis. When introduced into wild European rabbit populations in Australia, Europe and Great Britain, the virus was initially highly lethal, killing in excess of 99% of infected rabbits. Development of resistance was encouraged by the emergence of attenuated virus strains which allowed the survival of moderately resistant rabbits. This may have occurred more rapidly in hot climates, as high ambient temperatures increase the survival rate of infected rabbits. Resistant rabbits are less effective transmitters of the virus and this may encourage the emergence of more virulent virus strains. Little is known of the mechanism of resistance. There have been suggestions of non-genetic resistance. However, these are yet to be confirmed experimentally.

"In a series of experiments, the envelope glycoprotein (G protein) of bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) induced immunity against challenge with virulent virus. Protection correlated with the level of specific serum antibodies to G protein measured by a blocking ELISA test and with the level of neutralizing antibody. The optimum vaccination regimen consisted of two injections given 21 days apart at a dose rate of 0.32 microgram per cow of purified G protein emulsified in the adjuvant Quil A. This schedule conferred immunity for the duration of the preliminary experiment (46 days). Immunity to severe disease, but not to infection, remained for at least 12 months after vaccination, although BEFV could not be reisolated from vaccinated cattle following challenge. Unvaccinated cattle used as controls exhibited typical signs of clinical ephemeral fever and BEFV was recovered from all control animals following challenge.

"The single glycoprotein (G) of vesiclar stomatitis virus (VSV) was isolated in nearly quantitative yield by extraction of the purified virions with 0.05 M octyl-beta-D- glucoside (OG) in 0.01 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The extract contained essentially all of the viral phospholipids and glycolipids, and was free of other essentially all of the viral phospholipids and glycolipids, and was free of other viral proteins. Dialysis to remove OG resulted in the formation of G protein-viral lipid vesicles having a lipid-G protein ratio similar to that of the intact virions. The vesicles were 250-1,000 A in diameter, with a ""fuzzy"" external layer also similar to that of intact virions. The vesicles were predominantly unilamellar and sealed, with both phosphatidyl ethanolamine and gangliosides symmetrically distributed in the bilayer. G protein was asymmetrically oriented, with about 80 percent accessible to exogenous protease. Addition of soybean phospholipid to the viral extract before dialysis resulted in vesicles that incorporated viral proteins and lipids quantitatively, but that were markedly decreased in buoyant density. The G neutralized protein-lipid vesicles were effective in eliciting specific anti-G antibodies that neutralized viral infectivity. Competitive radioimmunoassay showed that both reconstituted vesicles and a soluble form of G protein (Gs) were indistinguishable from purified VSV in their antibody binding properties. Addition of G protein-lipid vesicles of BHK-21 cells before, or simultaneously with, infection by VSV inhibited viral infectivity, as measured by two independent techniques (viral RNA production in the presence of actinomycin D and a neutral red assay of cell viability). The total inhibitory activity of G protein in the vesicular form was, however, less than 5 percent of that found for intact virus particles that have been inactivated by ultraviolet light irradiation. Gs was inactive as an inhibitor as determined by the RNA production assay.

"Transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes by DNA methylation plays an important role in tumorigenesis. These aberrant epigenetic modifications may be mediated in part by elevated DNA methyltransferase levels. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), in particular, is overexpressed in many tumor types. Recently, we showed that Dnmt1 is transcriptionally regulated by E2F transcription factors and that retinoblastoma protein (pRb) inactivation induces Dnmt1. Based on these observations, we investigated regulation of Dnmt1 by polyomavirus oncogenes, which potently inhibit the pRb pocket protein family. Infection of primary human prostate epithelial cells with BK polyomavirus dramatically induced Dnmt1 transcription following large T antigen (TAg) translation and E2F activation. For in vivo study of Dnmt1 regulation, we used the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, which expresses the SV40 polyomavirus early region, including TAg, under control of a prostate-specific promoter. Analysis of TRAMP prostate lesions revealed greatly elevated Dnmt1 mRNA and protein levels beginning in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and continuing through advanced prostate cancer and metastasis. Interestingly, when TRAMP mice were treated in a chemopreventive manner with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza), 0 of 14 mice developed prostate cancer at 24 weeks of age, whereas 7 of 13 (54%) control-treated mice developed poorly differentiated prostate cancer. Treatment with 5-aza also prevented the development of lymph node metastases and dramatically extended survival compared with control-treated mice. Taken together, these data suggest that Dnmt1 is rapidly activated by pRb pathway inactivation, and that DNA methyltransferase activity is required for malignant transformation and tumorigenesis.

"T cell/transmembrane, Ig, and mucin (TIM) proteins, identified using a congenic mouse model of asthma, critically regulate innate and adaptive immunity. TIM-1 and TIM-4 are receptors for phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), exposed on the surfaces of apoptotic cells. Herein, we show with structural and biological studies that TIM-3 is also a receptor for PtdSer that binds in a pocket on the N-terminal IgV domain in coordination with a calcium ion. The TIM-3/PtdSer structure is similar to that of TIM-4/PtdSer, reflecting a conserved PtdSer binding mode by TIM family members. Fibroblastic cells expressing mouse or human TIM-3 bound and phagocytosed apoptotic cells, with the BALB/c allelic variant of mouse TIM-3 showing a higher capacity than the congenic C.D2 Es-Hba-allelic variant. These functional differences were due to structural differences in the BC loop of the IgV domain of the TIM-3 polymorphic variants. In contrast to fibroblastic cells, T or B cells expressing TIM-3 formed conjugates with but failed to engulf apoptotic cells. Together these findings indicate that TIM-3-expressing cells can respond to apoptotic cells, but the consequence of TIM-3 engagement of PtdSer depends on the polymorphic variants of and type of cell expressing TIM-3. These findings establish a new paradigm for TIM proteins as PtdSer receptors and unify the function of the TIM gene family, which has been associated with asthma and autoimmunity and shown to modulate peripheral tolerance.

"Zucker (fa/fa) rats with defective leptin receptors are obese, hyperphagic, and hyperinsulinemic. For testing whether chronic activation of the central melanocortin pathway can bypass the defective leptin signaling and normalize altered energy homeostasis in these rats, recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding pro-opiomelanocortin (rAAV-POMC) or control vector was delivered bilaterally into the basal hypothalamus with coordinates targeting the arcuate nucleus. Thirty-eight days after POMC gene delivery, hypothalamic POMC expression increased fourfold and melanocortin signaling (indicated by phosphorylation of CREB) increased by 62% with respect to controls. There was a sustained reduction in food intake, a moderate but significant attenuation of weight gain, and a 24% decrease in visceral adiposity in rAAV-POMC rats. POMC gene delivery enhanced uncoupling protein 1 in brown adipose tissue (BAT) by more than fourfold. Fasting serum leptin, insulin, and cholesterol levels were also significantly reduced by rAAV-POMC treatment. This study demonstrates that targeted POMC gene delivery in the hypothalamus suppresses food intake and weight gain and reduces visceral adiposity and hyperinsulinemia in leptin-resistant obese Zucker rats. The mechanisms may involve the sustained hypophagia and the augmentation of thermogenesis in BAT.

"Understanding how host dynamics, including variations of population size and dispersal, may affect the epidemiology of infectious diseases through ecological and evolutionary processes is an active research area. Here we focus on a bank vole (Myodes glareolus) metapopulation surveyed in Finland between 2005 and 2009. Bank vole is the reservoir of Puumala hantavirus (PUUV), the agent of nephropathia epidemica (NE, a mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal symptom) in humans. M. glareolus populations experience multiannual density fluctuations that may influence the level of genetic diversity maintained in bank voles, PUUV prevalence and NE occurrence. We examine bank vole metapopulation genetics at presumably neutral markers and immune-related genes involved in susceptibility to PUUV (Tnf-promoter, Tlr4, Tlr7 and Mx2 gene) to investigate the links between population dynamics, microevolutionary processes and PUUV epidemiology. We show that genetic drift slightly and transiently affects neutral and adaptive genetic variability within the metapopulation. Gene flow seems to counterbalance its effects during the multiannual density fluctuations. The low abundance phase may therefore be too short to impact genetic variation in the host, and consequently viral genetic diversity. Environmental heterogeneity does not seem to affect vole gene flow, which might explain the absence of spatial structure previously detected in PUUV in this area. Besides, our results suggest the role of vole dispersal on PUUV circulation through sex-specific and density-dependent movements. We find little evidence of selection acting on immune-related genes within this metapopulation. Footprint of positive selection is detected at Tlr-4 gene in 2008 only. We observe marginally significant associations between Mx2 genotype and PUUV genogroups. These results show that neutral processes seem to be the main factors affecting the evolution of these immune-related genes at a contemporary scale, although the relative effects of neutral and adaptive forces could vary temporally with density fluctuations. Immune related gene polymorphism may in turn partly influence PUUV epidemiology in this metapopulation.

"A variant was selected from a clinical isolate of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) during a single passage in the presence of a helicase-primase inhibitor (HPI) at eight times the IC(50). The variant was approximately 40-fold resistant to the HPI BAY 57-1293 and it showed significantly reduced growth in tissue culture with a concomitant reduction in virulence in a murine infection model. The variant contained a single mutation (Asn342Lys) in the UL5 predicted functional helicase motif IV. The Asn342Lys mutation was transferred to a laboratory strain, PDK cl-1, and the recombinant acquired the expected resistance and reduced growth characteristics. Comparative modelling and docking studies predicted the Asn342 position to be physically distant from the HPI interaction pocket formed by UL5 and UL52 (primase). We suggest that this mutation results in steric/allosteric modification of the HPI-binding pocket, conferring an indirect resistance to the HPI. Slower growth and moderately reduced virulence suggest that this mutation might also interfere with the helicase-primase activity.

"A cDNA sequence which contains the entire coding region for human purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) was recombined for selection and expression in mammalian cells. Plasmids containing either the simian virus 40 early promoter or the mouse metallothionein promoter positioned just upstream of the PNP coding sequence were constructed. These plasmids also contained the gene for a methotrexate-resistant dihydrofolate reductase, allowing for selection and amplification of positive transferrents after transfection of cells by the DNA-calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique. Expression of human PNP activity was readily detected in both mouse (L) and CHO cells by isoelectric focusing of cell extracts followed by histochemical staining for PNP activity. The simian virus 40 early promoter directed considerable expression of human PNP activity in CHO cells but only scant activity in mouse cells. The mouse metallothionein promoter was not successful in effecting human PNP expression in CHO cells but provided substantial human PNP activity in mouse cells and was inducible by incubation with zinc. HeLa cell transferrents were isolated and screened for the presence of transferred PNP cDNA sequences by Southern hybridization analysis. RNA transcripts derived from the transferred PNP cDNA were identified in one of these cell lines.

"BI 224436 is an HIV-1 integrase inhibitor with effective antiviral activity that acts through a mechanism that is distinct from that of integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs). This 3-quinolineacetic acid derivative series was identified using an enzymatic integrase long terminal repeat (LTR) DNA 3'-processing assay. A combination of medicinal chemistry, parallel synthesis, and structure-guided drug design led to the identification of BI 224436 as a candidate for preclinical profiling. It has antiviral 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of <15 nM against different HIV-1 laboratory strains and cellular cytotoxicity of >90 μM. BI 224436 also has a low, ∼2.1-fold decrease in antiviral potency in the presence of 50% human serum and, by virtue of a steep dose-response curve slope, exhibits serum-shifted EC95 values ranging between 22 and 75 nM. Passage of virus in the presence of inhibitor selected for either A128T, A128N, or L102F primary resistance substitutions, all mapping to a conserved allosteric pocket on the catalytic core of integrase. BI 224436 also retains full antiviral activity against recombinant viruses encoding INSTI resistance substitutions N155S, Q148H, and E92Q. In drug combination studies performed in cellular antiviral assays, BI 224436 displays an additive effect in combination with most approved antiretrovirals, including INSTIs. BI 224436 has drug-like in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, including Caco-2 cell permeability, solubility, and low cytochrome P450 inhibition. It exhibited excellent pharmacokinetic profiles in rat (clearance as a percentage of hepatic flow [CL], 0.7%; bioavailability [F], 54%), monkey (CL, 23%; F, 82%), and dog (CL, 8%; F, 81%). Based on the excellent biological and pharmacokinetic profile, BI 224436 was advanced into phase 1 clinical trials.

"A mouse monoclonal hybridoma cell line producing IgG 1k to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) gp120 envelope protein was cultured in several systems. A small-scale flask culture was essential for characterizing the culture variables of the hybridoma. A dialysis tubing culture appeared to be an excellent alternative to in vivo cultures of ascitic fluid, and gave high mouse monoclonal antibody (Mab) concentrations. Two continuous culture systems were both very effective in producing large amounts of Mabs. The hollow fiber system has the advantage of giving a concentrated product in the harvest. The ceramic core system, on the other hand, allows excellent monitoring of the cellular growth and production phases and gave the highest HIV antigen reactivity/micrograms of the produced IgG. Twelve grams of HIV-1 neutralizing Mabs were produced. The Mab was purified with a yield of 61%. The neutralizing capacity of the Mab was studied in vitro and shown to be excellent with 50% neutralizing titers using 5 ng Mab. The biological half-life of the Mab given intravenously to an HIV-infected individual was shown to be around 30 h.

"Virus removal from groundwater by soil passage often appears to be much higher during the first few metres due to the presence of more favorable sites for attachment than thereafter. A model is presented which interprets virus removal as a function of collision efficiencies alpha(beta) and alpha(lambda), inactivation rate coefficient mu(t) and rate parameter gamma. Initial high removal is determined by ab, which decreases exponentially at a rate g to a constant base removal rate that is determined by alpha(lambda) and mu(t). A hypothetical worst case was simulated to calculate the travel distance and time required for 9 log10 protection against virus contamination of groundwater wells in anoxic sandy aquifers. Unfavorable conditions for attachment were assumed. Virus was constantly leaking from a sewage pipe lying at the groundwater table. Mixing reduced virus concentration by 3.1 to 4.0 log10. For an additional 5.0 to 5.9 l log10 protection against virus contamination by attachment and inactivation, residence times of about three to seven times longer than the current guideline of 60 days are needed, depending on abstraction rates, aquifer thickness and grain size of the sand.

"The molecular action of lithocholic acid (LCA), a selective inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerase beta (pol beta), was investigated. We found that LCA could also strongly inhibit the activity of human DNA topoisomerase II (topo II). No other DNA metabolic enzymes tested were affected by LCA. Therefore, LCA should be classified as an inhibitor of both pol beta and topo II. Here, we report the molecular interaction of LCA with pol beta and topo II. By three-dimensional structural model analysis and by comparison with the spatial positioning of specific amino acids binding to LCA on pol beta (Lys60, Leu77, and Thr79), we obtained supplementary information that allowed us to build a structural model of topo II. Modeling analysis revealed that the LCA-interaction interface in both enzymes has a pocket comprised of three amino acids in common, which binds to the LCA molecule. In topo II, the three amino acid residues were Lys720, Leu760, and Thr791. These results suggested that the LCA binding domains of pol beta and topo II are three-dimensionally very similar.

"Twenty-two new alkenyldiarylmethanes (ADAMs) were synthesized and evaluated for inhibition of HIV-1 replication. The most potent compound proved to be methyl 3',3""-dichloro-4',4""-dimethoxy-5', 5""-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-6,6-diphenyl-5-hexenoate (ADAM II), which displayed an EC50 of 13 nM for inhibition of the cytopathic effect of HIV-1RF in CEM-SS cells. ADAM II inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC50 of 0.3 microM but was inactive as an inhibitor of HIV-1 attachment/fusion to cells, protease, integrase, and the nucleocapsid protein. Molecular target-based and cell-based assays revealed that ADAM II acted biologically as a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). ADAM II inhibited replication of a wide variety of laboratory, clinical, and clade-representative isolates of HIV-1 in T cell lines and cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells or monocyte/macrophages. Mutations that conferred resistance to ADAM II clustered at residues 101, 103, 108, 139, 179, 181, and 188, which line the nonnucleoside binding pocket of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. However, HIV-1 NL4-3 strain expressing a mutation at residue 100 of reverse transcriptase, and an AZT-resistant virus, displayed increased sensitivity to ADAM II. Thus, ADAM II could serve as an adjunct therapy to AZT and NNRTIs that select for L100I resistance mutations.

"NK cell turnover and division during infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was examined. Treatments with hydroxyurea (HU), a drug specific for cells synthesizing DNA, had no effect on control spleen NK cells, but significantly reduced NK cell-mediated lysis in LCMV-infected mice. When HU was administered at 9 and 2 hr before spleen cell harvest, the augmented lysis mediated by NK cells isolated from LCMV-infected mice was only 40% of that mediated by NK cells isolated from LCMV-infected untreated mice. Spleen cells that had been pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine were used in a single cell assay with autoradiography to detect lysis mediated by blast cells. HU eliminated blast-NK cells; 34% of activated NK cell killing was mediated by blast cells, whereas less than 12% of the reduced NK cell activity after HU treatments was blast cell-mediated. The NK cells activated in vivo had lower densities than control NK cells. Although the total cell yields from control spleens and spleens on day 3 post-infection with LCMV were similar, low density Percoll gradient fractions from the day 3 spleen cell preparations contained three times as many cells as equivalent fractions from control populations. The same low density fractions were enriched in NK cell activity and in blast-NK cells. Activated spleen cell populations also contained increased numbers of large granular lymphocytes. These data indicate that NK cells have increased turnover rates during viral infection, that this increase in turnover is accompanied by NK cell division, and that this results in increases in the numbers of NK cells.

"Although low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) are detected in shorebirds at Delaware Bay annually, little is known about affected species habitat preferences or the movement patterns that might influence virus transmission and spread. During the 5-wk spring migration stopover period during 2007-2008, we conducted a radiotelemetry study of often-infected ruddy turnstones (Arenaria interpres morinella; n = 60) and rarely infected sanderlings (Calidris alba; n = 20) to identify locations and habitats important to these species (during daytime and nighttime), determine the extent of overlap with other AIV reservoir species or poultry production areas, reveal possible movements of AIV around the Bay, and assess whether long-distance movement of AIV is likely after shorebird departure. Ruddy turnstones and sanderlings both fed on Bay beaches during the daytime. However, sanderlings used remote sandy points and islands during the nighttime while ruddy turnstones primarily used salt marsh harboring waterfowl and gull breeding colonies, suggesting that this environment supports AIV circulation. Shorebird locations were farther from agricultural land and poultry operations than were random locations, suggesting selection away from poultry. Further, there was no areal overlap between shorebird home ranges and poultry production areas. Only 37% (22/60) of ruddy turnstones crossed into Delaware from capture sites in New Jersey, suggesting partial site fidelity and AIV gene pool separation between the states. Ruddy turnstones departed en masse around June 1 when AIV prevalence was low or declining, suggesting that a limited number of birds could disperse AIV onto the breeding grounds. This study provides needed insight into AIV and migratory host ecology, and results can inform both domestic animal AIV prevention and shorebird conservation efforts.

"The sandy beaches of the Brazilian Amazon coast have enormous touristic potential and attract thousands of visitors each year, principally in July, at the beginning of the summer vacation period. In 2020, beach going was affected worldwide by the Covid-19 pandemic, but how did the pandemic affect recreational beach use on the Amazon coast in the Brazilian state of Pará? Given this, the objective of this work is to identify public perception in compliance with health safety established by authorities due to COVID-19 pandemic in two popular beaches on the Brazilian Amazon. Recreational patterns on the beaches of this region were analyzed from the user's perspective in July, through semi-structured interviews and direct observations. Recreational activities were prohibited on the beaches located within protected areas. At other locations, however, including Ajuruteua and Atalaia, the beaches were reopened on July 1 st, and both sites received thousands of visitors in July, despite the fact that interviewees believed the pandemic to be dangerous, and considered the situation in Pará state to be at least as bad or worse than in previous months. Agglomerations were verified on both study beaches and social distancing and other protective measures were limited. The increase in the new cases recorded in August was due to the relaxation of restrictions on social, recreational, and economic activities by the local authorities in July 2020, including the reopening of public access to beaches. As Pará state has been hard-hit by the pandemic, prohibitions on recreational beach use should clearly not have been lifted during this period. A number of management measures were presented in this study. These measures should contribute to the prevention of the spread of the virus during the upcoming public holidays, as long as the pandemic continues.

"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the respiratory infection known as COVID-19. From an immunopathological standpoint, coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 induce increased levels of a variety of T-helper 1 (Th1) and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, CCL2 protein, and CXCL10 protein. In the absence of proven antiviral agents or an effective vaccine, substances with immunomodulatory activity may be able to inhibit inflammatory and Th1 cytokines and/or yield an anti-inflammatory and/or Th2 immune response to counteract COVID-19 symptoms and severity. This report briefly describes the following four unconventional but commercially accessible immunomodulatory agents that can be employed in clinical trials to evaluate their effectiveness at alleviating disease symptoms and severity: low-dose oral interferon alpha, microdose DNA, low-dose thimerosal, and phytocannabinoids.

"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRB) is a potent inhibitor of mammalian cell growth and the functional inactivation of pRB is widely presumed to be essential for progression of the cell cycle from G1 phase. In this work, the generality of pRB-based cell cycle control in mammalian cells was addressed by conditionally expressing pRB in cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells. We show herein that these cells are able to progress through the cell cycle in response to cytokine despite the continued presence of supraphysiological amounts of wild-type pRB or phosphorylation-resistant pRB mutants. However, their growth was strongly blocked by ectopic expression of the pRB-related pocket protein, p130. This growth inhibition required the E2F-binding pocket domain but not the cyclin-binding domain of p130. Furthermore, increased amounts of the p130-controlled E2F, termed E2F-4, potentiated the mitogenic response of the cells to cytokine and the constitutive overexpression of E2F-4 rendered the cells cytokine-independent. Our results indicate the existence of a non-pRB-based cell cycle whose operation depends primarily on the interplay between p130 and E2F-4 in certain hematopoietic cells.

"The woodchuck (Marmota monax) is an animal model that is used in the study of human hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection. A knowledge of woodchuck MHC class I (Mamo-I) genes and gene products is therefore essential for understanding the antigen-specific T-cell responses in this animal model. A number of Mamo-I genes have been identified by molecular cloning and sequencing. However, the allelic nature of these genes has not been proven by classical genetics like the segregation analysis in families. In this study, we analyzed the allelic diversity of Mamo-I in two three-generation woodchuck families including 15 members by sequencing of Mamo-I genes and immunoblotting of Mamo-I proteins after one-dimensional isoelectric focusing (1D-IEF). In addition to four published Mamo-I alleles, six new alleles that belonged to the same locus as the known Mamo-I alleles (Mamo-A) were found within the two woodchuck families. A typical Mendelian segregation of Mamo-I gene and antigens was observed in the families studied. For simple and rapid detection of allelic variability of Mamo-I gene, a typing method based on the detection of PCR products amplified by sequence specific primers (SSP) has been developed and tested in 41 unrelated animals. The most prevalent allele was Mamo-A*01 with a frequency of 21.9% followed by Mamo-A*07 (12.2%). Our study established Mamo-A as a classical MHC class I locus by the polymorphic and allelic nature of Mamo-I gene in the woodchuck.

"One of the most severe European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) pathogens is myxoma virus (MYXV), a rabbit-specific leporipoxvirus that causes the highly lethal disease myxomatosis. Other leporid genera, Sylvilagus and Lepus, encompass species with variable susceptibilities to MYXV, but these do not develop the lethal form of the disease. The protective role of the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I/DDX58) in sensing MYXV in nonpermissive human myeloid cells prompted the study of the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family evolution in the three leporid genera. This viral-sensor family also includes the melanoma differentiation-associated factor 5 (MDA5/IFIH1), and the laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2/DHX58). Considering specifically the MYXV susceptible host (European rabbit) and one of the virus natural long-term hosts (Sylvilagus bachmani, brush rabbit), the amino acid differences of positively selected sites in RIG-I between the two species were located in the protein region responsible for viral RNA recognition and binding, the repressor domain. Such differences might play a determinant role in how MYXV is sensed. When looking for episodic selection on MDA5 and LGP2 of the eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), we also uncovered evidence of selective pressures that might be exerted by a species-specific leporipoxvirus, the Shope fibroma virus. Finally, a putative alternative splicing case was identified in Oryctolagus and Lepus MDA5 isoforms, corresponding to the deletion of one specific exon. This study provided the first insights into the evolution of the leporid RLR gene family that helps illuminate the origins of the species-specific innate responses to pathogens and more specifically to MYXV.

"The sequence organisation of endogenous VL30 elements in the mouse genome was investigated by using a cloned representative of a retrovirus-transmissible VL30 cDNA. The majority of dispersed VL30 sequences could be assigned to a proviral-like structure 5.2-5.3 kbp long and bounded by long terminal repeats (LTRs). The existence of a hierarchy of evolutionarily conserved elements was rather limited and sequence heterogeneity between different elements was randomly distributed. However, the retrovirus-transmissible class of VL30 element was found to represent a distinct minority subgroup distinguishable by restriction sites and size (4.6-4.9 kbp long). Analysis of sequence conservation showed that VL30 elements display a more rapid turnover than endogenous murine leukaemia virus-related proviral sequences, and that VL30 LTRs show the most limited evolutionary distribution. Although discrete subsets of VL30 unique sequence were conserved in different rodents, the location of conserved regions was found to be variable, arguing against the presence of a functionally conserved protein coding region. These observations support the hypothesis that high frequency recombination, probably occurring during reverse transcription and the accompanying processes of duplicative transposition and amplification, have been a major determinant in the mode of evolution of the VL30 gene family.

"Historically, therapeutic benefit in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-1) infection has been best achieved by targeting viral proteins like HIV protease involved in viral replication rather than host cell proteins, like CD4, which facilitate the process of viral infection. Two discoveries in 1996 presented a novel opportunity to redress this issue: 1) the understanding that heptahelical G-protein coupled chemokine receptors on the surface of T cells and macrophages functioned together with CD4 to mediate viral entry, and 2) the observation that CD4 positive T cells from individuals homozygous for the CCR5 delta 32 null allele were resistant to infection by macrophage-tropic strains of the virus in vitro and in vivo. Since that time, data demonstrating that selective blockade of two chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, by small molecule chemokine receptor antagonists or receptor-directed biologics could robustly inhibit the infection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by macrophage-tropic and T-cell line tropic strains respectively in vitro has validated this potential approach to therapy. Early clinical trial data now also confirms that these types of agents will have anti-viral activity in some HIV-1 infected individuals; however to date, dose limiting off-target activities have prohibited a full test of their potential clinical value. It also remains to be seen how these types of agents will fare in synergy with existing HIV-1 targeted antivirals, or those currently in development.

"Stubby-root nematodes (family Trichoridae) are an economically important group of ectoparasites that feed on roots, vector tobraviruses, and cause substantial crop loss (1,2,3). In June 2013, 48 soil samples were submitted to the Nematology Laboratory at Ohio State University for nematode analysis from a field planted to corn in Wood County, Ohio. The soil texture was sandy and the field was previously planted to wheat and soybean in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Nematodes were extracted from 100 cm(3) soil by decanting and sieving followed by sucrose centrifugal flotation. Phytoparasitic nematodes were identified and counted based on morphological traits to genus at 40× to 63× magnification. Nematode genera parasitic to corn recovered from these samples included Helicotylenchus, Hoplolaimus, Paratrichodorus, Pratylenchus, and Tylenchorhynchus. Stubby-root nematodes (Paratrichodorus sp.) were detected in more than 60% of the samples with a maximum count of 52 per 100 cm(3) soil. Individual stubby-root nematodes were hand-picked and identified to species under a compound light microscope as Paratrichodorus allius (Jensen, 1963) Siddiqi, 1974 according to morphological and morphometric characteristics (1). Females (n = 14) were observed with the intestine not anteriorly overlapping the esophagus, posterior subventral esophageal glands overlapping the intestine, caudal pores, absence of spermatheca, and vaginal sclerotization reduced in lateral view. Body length ranged from 475.8 to 840.5 μm (mean = 652.2 μm), and onchiostylet length ranged from 37.7 to 47.4 μm (mean = 42.9 μm). DNA was extracted from single adult females (n = 4) and the 18S rRNA region was amplified with 18S (TTGATTACGTCCCTGCCCTTT) and 26S (TTTCACTCGCCGTTACTAAGG) primers (4). PCR products were purified and sequenced. The sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KF887974) and was compared with previously deposited sequences by means of BLAST search. The comparison revealed a sequence similarity of 98 to 99% with both P. allius and P. teres (AM269895, AM087124, AJ439572, FJ040484, AJ439575, and AM087125). P. allius and P. teres can be difficult to discriminate using both morphological characteristics and molecular sequencing (3). Therefore, a universal primer (BL18: 5' CCCGTCGMTACTACCGATT 3') and species-specific primers designed to produce PCR products of 432 bp (PAR2: 5'-CCGTTCAAACGCGTATATGATC-3') and 677 bp (PTR4: 5'-CCTGACAAGC'IWGCACTAGC-3') were used for P. allius and P. teres, respectively (3). DNA from individuals used for sequencing was used in PCR reactions with each species-specific primer. DNA samples yielded PCR products of 432 bp with the P. allius-specific primer set and had no reaction with the P. teres-specific primer set. Molecular results and morphological observations confirmed the presence of P. allius in the samples. P. allius is a polyphagous migratory ectoparasite and a vector for Tobacco rattle virus (TRV). The known distribution of P. allius has previously been limited to the Pacific Northwest, where it was originally described as an important pathogen in potato production (2,3). Corn and wheat have been reported as suitable hosts; although they are not susceptible to TRV, crop loss may result from direct damage to roots (2,3). Nematode management recommendations for corn and wheat will depend on the distribution of this nematode. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. allius in Ohio. References: (1) W. Decreamer.

"BACKGROUND: In the past, national emergencies in the United States have resulted in increased gun preparation (ie, purchasing new guns or removing guns from storage); in turn, these gun actions have effected increases in firearm injuries and deaths. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to assess the extent to which interest in gun preparation has increased amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic using data from Google searches related to purchasing and cleaning guns. METHODS: We fit an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model over Google search data from January 2004 up to the week that US President Donald Trump declared COVID-19 a national emergency. We used this model to forecast Google search volumes, creating a counterfactual of the number of gun preparation searches we would expect if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred, and reported observed deviations from this counterfactual. RESULTS: Google searches related to preparing guns have surged to unprecedented levels, approximately 40% higher than previously reported spikes following the Sandy Hook, CT and Parkland, FL shootings and 158% (95% CI 73-270) greater than would be expected if the COVID-19 pandemic had not occurred. In absolute terms, approximately 2.1 million searches related to gun preparation were performed over just 34 days. States severely affected by COVID-19 appear to have some of the greatest increases in the number of searches. CONCLUSIONS: Our results corroborate media reports that gun purchases are increasing amid the COVID-19 pandemic and provide more precise geographic and temporal trends. Policy makers should invest in disseminating evidence-based educational tools about gun risks and safety procedures to avert a collateral public health crisis.

"OBJECTIVE: To construct a eukaryotic expression vector to express the hepatitis E virus protein open reading frame 3 (ORF3) and investigate the intracellular location of the expressed protein using the baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) fibroblast cell line. METHODS: The ORF3 gene was amplified by RT-PCR, cloned into the HindIII and EcoRI sites in the multicloning site of the pDsRed-Monomer-N1mammalian expression vector that encodes a red fluorescent protein (DsRed), and confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. The recombinant plasmid was then transfected into BHK-21 cells via the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent; the subsequent ORF3 gene overexpression was confirmed by RT-PCR and the protein expression and location was detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence assay.Results TThe pDsRed-Monomer-N1-ORF3 recombinant plasmid was successfully constructed. After transfection into BHK-21 ceils, the ORF3 gene was transcribed and expressed, and the ORF3 protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm, where it could react with a specific antibody. CONCLUSION: The ORF3-DsRed fusion protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm of BHK-21 fibroblasts, and may represent a useful tool for research on the role of this protein in HEV infection.

"Using an appropriate animal model is crucial for mimicking human disease conditions, and various facets including genetics, anatomy, and pathophysiology should be considered before selecting a model. Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) are well known for their wide use in production of antibodies, eye research, atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases. However, a systematic description of the rabbit as primary experimental models for the study of various human infectious diseases is unavailable. This review focuses on the human infectious diseases for which rabbits are considered a classic or highly appropriate model, including AIDS (caused by HIV1), adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (human T-lymphotropic virus type 1), papilloma or carcinoma (human papillomavirus) , herpetic stromal keratitis (herpes simplex virus type 1), tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis), and syphilis (Treponema pallidum). In addition, particular aspects of the husbandry and care of rabbits used in studies of human infectious diseases are described.

"We have previously shown that interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 are constitutively produced by human oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and some derived cell lines but not by cultured normal oral keratinocytes. To elucidate possible cytokine regulatory pathways that may contribute to oral SCC growth and/or progression, we tested the hypotheses that exogenous and/or endogenous IL-1 regulates IL-6 production in vitro. We investigated the effects of exogenous IL-1 and IL-6 on secondary cytokine secretion. Our studies revealed that IL-1 strongly up-regulated IL-6 protein secretion in all three cell lines tested. This effect was completely abrogated by IL-1 receptor antagonist. IL-1 receptor antagonist also inhibited the secretion of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta in two of three cell lines. These data show for the first time that IL-1 strongly up-regulates IL-6 and support the notion of autocrine regulation of IL-1 in certain oral SCC cell lines. Additionally, because human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and p53 mutation have been implicated in the malignant transformation of SCC, we explored a second hypothesis, that HPV and/or p53 mutation contribute to cytokine dis-regulation. We investigated HPV DNA presence, transcriptional activation of HPV E6/E7 (in HPV DNA-positive cell lines), and p53 gene status in our cell lines. No association between HPV DNA and cytokine expression was found. However, the oral SCC cell lines secreting the most IL-6 had mutant rather than wild-type p53.

"Agoutis (Dasyprocta sp) are hystricomorph rodents belonging to the family Dasyproctidae. Utilization of agoutis in a research program of the National Institutes of Health necessitated the development of suitable methods for feeding, housing and collecting blood. The rodents were maintained successfully in conventional dog cages and kennels, and thrived on a diet of primate diet and apples. Physical examinations and periodic blood collections were best performed while agoutis were sedated with ketamine HCl (42-83 mg/kg, intramuscularly). Satisfactory sites for blood sampling were the cephalic, saphenous and jugular veins. Hematologic and serum chemical values established for the agouti were similar to those found in other rodents. Experimentally induced and naturally occurring diseases of agoutis were reviewed.

"During the past few years, CNO-sensitive designer G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) have emerged as powerful new tools for the study of GPCR physiology. In this chapter, we present protocols employing adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to express a Gq-coupled DREADD (Dq) in two metabolically important cell types, AgRP neurons of the hypothalamus and hepatocytes of the liver. We also provide examples dealing with the metabolic analysis of the Dq mutant mice after administration of CNO in vivo. The approaches described in this chapter can be applied to other members of the DREADD family and, of course, different cell types. It is likely that the use of DREADD technology will identify physiologically important signaling pathways that can be targeted for therapeutic purposes.

"The prevalent human hantavirus disease in Sweden is nephropathia epidemica, which is caused by Puumala virus and shed by infected bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus). To evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of this disease, we studied 2,468 reported cases from a highly disease-endemic region in northern Sweden. We found that, in particular, middle-aged men living in rural dwellings near coastal areas were overrepresented. The case-patients were most often infected in late autumn, when engaged in activities near or within manmade rodent refuges. Of 862 case-patients confident about the site of virus exposure, 50% were concentrated within 5% of the study area. The incidence of nephropathia epidemica was significantly correlated with bank vole numbers within monitored rodent populations in part of the region. Understanding this relationship may help forestall future human hantavirus outbreaks.

"The mouse mammary tumor virus (MuMTV) contains several low-molecular-weight proteins which, together with the genomic RNA, constitute the core structure of the virion. The most abundant protein in the core is the 27,000-dalton protein (p27), and, by analogy to the type C viruses, this protein probably forms the core shell. In mouse mammary tumor cell lines (GR and Mm5MT) producing MuMTV the major p57 antigenic specificity resides in a large protein, which migrates in polyacrylamide gels as a doublet of 77,000 and 75,000 daltons (p 77/75). A series of lower-molecular-weight proteins, p61, p48, p38, and p34, is also present in small amounts and is probably derived by proteolytic cleavage of the p 77/75. These proteins have been identified by immunoprecipitation with monospecific antiserum, and their sequence relatedness to p27 has been determined by an analysis of the peptides after trypsin digestion. After a 15-min pulse with [35S]-methionine, all of the p27-related proteins in these cell lines were labelled and, during a subsequent chase, progressively disappeared. The p27 was labeled poorly during the pulse, but the amount of label in this protein increased during the chase. A quantitation of these experiments suggested that the majority of the p27-related proteins were quite rapidly turned over in these cell lines. Hence, if p27 is derived by a progressive proteolytic cleavage mechanism, then the process is inefficient in the GR cells and only moderately efficient in the Mm5MT cells. When MuMTV was isolated from the culture medium of these cells harvested at 5-min intervals, the major p27-related protein was p34. The p27 accounted for only 29% of the anti-p27 serum immunoprecipitable proteins compared to 95% in virus isolated from an 18-h harvest. Incubation of the rapid-harvest virus at 37 degrees C for 2 h resulted in some conversion of p34 to p27. These results suggest that some of the p27 in MuMTV is formed in the virions by proteolytic cleavage of p34.

"Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the main causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease which seriously threatens young children's health and lives. However, there is no effective therapy currently available for treating these infections. Therefore, effective drugs to prevent and treat EV-A71 infections are urgently needed. Here, we identified Mulberroside C potently against the proliferation of EV-A71. The in-vitro anti-EV-A71 activity of Mulberroside C was assessed by cytopathic effect inhibition and viral plaque reduction assays, and the results showed that Mulberroside C significantly inhibited EV-A71 infection. The downstream assays affirmed that Mulberroside C inhibited viral protein and RNA synthesis. Furthermore, Mulberroside C effectively reduced clinical symptoms in EV-A71 infected mice and reduced mortality at higher concentrations. The mechanism study indicated that Mulberroside C bound to the hydrophobic pocket of viral capsid protein VP1, thereby preventing viral uncoating and genome release. Taken together, our study indicated that Mulberroside C could be a promising EV-A71 inhibitor and worth extensive preclinical investigation as a lead compound.

"During the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals, numerous adventitious agents have been detected in Master Cell Banks, end-of-production cells as well as bulk harvest fluid. Recently, a number of large-scale production bioreactors have become infected with Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) during cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) operations, and this has resulted in both the loss of product and the need for major cleaning validation procedures to be put in place. We have developed a simple DNA extraction/PCR assay to detect the presence of MVM in cell culture supernatant (conditioned cell fluids). This highly specific assay can detect 10 or fewer genome equivalents (copies) of MVM following PCR and gel electrophoresis visualization. For routine high-throughput detection, 300-100 copies could be consistently detected. The extraction procedure was shown to reliably detect MVM at a concentration of 1 TCID50/ml. The combination of the extraction/PCR procedure establishes a powerful, sensitive, specific assay that can detect the presence of MVM sequences with a 1-day turnaround time.

"Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection frequently present with extrahepatic manifestations covering a large spectrum, involving different organ systems leading to the concept of systemic HCV infection. These manifestations include autoimmune phenomena and frank autoimmune and/or rheumatic diseases and may dominate the course of chronic HCV infection. Chronic HCV infection causes liver inflammation affecting the development of hepatic diseases. HCV is also a lymphotropic virus that triggers B cells and promotes favorable conditions for B lymphocyte proliferation, including mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) and MC vasculitis, which is the most prominent extrahepatic manifestation of chronic HCV infection. HCV may also promote a low-grade chronic systemic inflammation that may affect the development of some extrahepatic manifestations, particularly cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases. Recognition of extrahepatic symptoms of HCV infection could facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. The development of direct-acting antiviral agents (DDAs) has revolutionized HCV treatment. DDAs, as well as new B-cell-depleting or B-cell-modulating monoclonal antibodies, will expand the panorama of treatment options for HCV-related extrahepatic manifestations including cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. In this context, a proactive, integrated approach to HCV therapy should maximize the benefits of HCV therapy, even when liver disease is mild.

"In this study, we review annual rabies data from Massachusetts from 1985 to 2006, spanning the introduction of raccoon strain rabies in 1992. Of 52,034 animals tested, 9.7% (5,049/52,034) were rabid, representing 26 of over 67 species submitted. Bats were the most common rabid animals prior to 1992 (50 of 52), but raccoons (Procyon lotor) became the most common rabies-positive species upon arrival of raccoon strain rabies virus (38.2%, 2,728 of 7,138 tested), followed by striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis, 34.4%, 1,489 of 4,332), bats (5.3%, 427 of 8,053), foxes (red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and gray fox, Urocyon cinereoargenteus, 16.3%, 135 of 827), cats (0.8%, 136 of 18,050), and woodchucks (Marmota monax, 5.7%, 82 of 1,446). Cats were the most frequently tested animal (34.7%). Raccoon strain rabies spread from two foci of introduction with an initial epizootic phase of 4 yr, by which time most of the state was affected. In 1992, there was a transition from enzootic bat rabies, with little spillover to other animals, to terrestrial rabies associated with raccoon strain virus. Although raccoons were most affected by the raccoon strain virus, there was spillover to other species, particularly to skunks. The eastern United States raccoon rabies epizootic led to a marked increase in submissions for rabies testing and the number of positive animals detected; however, bat rabies cases remained at their previous levels. Wild animal rabies presents a significant threat to humans and domestic/companion animals and increased costs related to increased demand for rabies testing, postexposure prophylaxis as well as euthanasia of valuable domestic animals.

"The tumor suppressor Rb is a nuclear phosphoprotein that controls cell growth and differentiation by modulating the activity of certain transcription factors. Transport of Rb to the nucleus is affected by both a bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the C-terminus of the protein and a central domain, termed A/B or pocket, through which Rb interacts with transcription factors and viral oncoproteins. Mutations in either the A or B subdomains of the pocket render a NLS-deficient Rb completely cytoplasmic. Fusing the A/B domain of Rb to the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase, to create betagal-A/B, confers nuclear localization upon this bacterial protein. Moreover, co-expression with the adenovirus oncoprotein, E1A, further augments nuclear localization of betagal-A/B. These findings provide direct evidence that the pocket domain of Rb is not only required but also sufficient to induce nuclear transport by a 'piggyback' mechanism. Thus, nuclear localization of Rb is dictated by two independent and autonomous domains: (i) the bipartite NLS and (ii) the pocket domain. We suggest that via these domains, Rb chaperons and co-compartmentalizes with its associated factors and preempts their activity prior to nuclear transport.

"Autologous stem cell transplantation combined with gene therapy can potentially be used to treat genetically inherited diseases. However, characterization of multipotential cells from a disease state remains extremely limited. We have characterized adult bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) derived from three retinal degenerative mouse models and compared them to marrow stromal cells derived from their normal strain counterparts. Despite similar profiles soon after harvest, at 30 days postisolation, marrow stromal cells derived from a disease origin were shown to contain a large pool (approximately 89-99%) of undifferentiated marrow stromal cells (CD90(+)/STRO-1(+)) as compared to their normal counterparts (approximately 19-43%). Fetal bovine serum appeared essential for marrow stromal cell proliferation and was not found to induce differentiation, although it could be substituted with other additives including epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). We also showed that resulting CD90(+)/STRO(+) cells derived from both states could be directed into desired lineages expressing at the same rate and that they could be transduced with the same efficiency using different viral vehicles. This investigation has shown the existence of a large pool of undifferentiated stem cells derived from the disease state that have the potential to form the desired cell types when appropriately cued.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of liver disease worldwide. The development of much needed specific antiviral therapies and an effective vaccine has been hampered by the lack of a convenient small animal model. The determinants restricting HCV tropism to human and chimpanzee hosts are unknown. Replication of the viral RNA has been demonstrated in mouse cells, but these cells are not infectable with either lentiviral particles bearing HCV glycoproteins (HCVpp) or HCV produced in cell culture (HCVcc) (A.P., M.E. and C.M.R., unpublished observations), suggesting that there is a block at the level of entry. Here we show, using an iterative complementary DNA library screening approach, that human occludin (OCLN) is an essential HCV cell entry factor that is able to render murine cells infectable with HCVpp. Similarly, OCLN is required for the HCV-susceptibility of human cells, because its overexpression in uninfectable cells specifically enhanced HCVpp uptake, whereas its silencing in permissive cells impaired both HCVpp and HCVcc infection. In addition to OCLN, HCVpp infection of murine cells required expression of the previously identified HCV entry factors CD81 (ref. 4), scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI, also known as SCARB1) and claudin-1 (CLDN1). Although the mouse versions of SR-BI and CLDN1 function at least as well as the human proteins in promoting HCV entry, both OCLN and CD81 must be of human origin to allow efficient infection. The species-specific determinants of OCLN were mapped to its second extracellular loop. The identification of OCLN as a new HCV entry factor further highlights the importance of the tight junction complex in the viral entry process, and provides an important advance towards efforts to develop small animal models for HCV.

"PURPOSE: Cancer metastases may have phenotypic and genetic differences from their primary cancers of origin. Engineered, replication-competent, attenuated viruses based on herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) have shown potent oncolytic effects in treating primary tumors in animal tumor models, but their efficacy in treating lymph node metastases is poorly understood. We compared the efficacy of an attenuated oncolytic HSV-1 (NV1023) in treating a series of murine squamous carcinoma cell lines derived from serial implantation and harvest from metastatic lymph nodes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULTS: The auricles of C3H/HeJ mice were implanted with SCCVII. Cervical nodal metastases were isolated, expanded in vitro, and reimplanted into new mice. A series of cell lines (LN1-LN7) were generated through seven serial passages. Cells from higher LN passages showed consistent trends toward increased migratory and invasive ability, increased cell surface nectin-1 (an HSV-1 receptor) expression, and increased glycoprotein D binding. Exposure to NV1023 showed increased viral entry, replication, and cytotoxicity with higher LN passages. Intratumoral injection of NV1023 in a murine flank tumor model caused significantly greater tumor regression and increased viral infection of LN7 compared with SCCVII. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that lymph node metastases may undergo selection for characteristics, including increased nectin-1 expression, that make them more sensitive targets for herpes oncolytic therapy. These findings support the clinical application of these agents for the treatment of lymph node metastases.

"PURPOSE: To study the effect of increasing the chain length over C-18 and varying the oxidation level in synthesized N4, N9-diacyl spermines on DNA and siRNA formulation, and then to compare their transfection efficiency in cell lines METHODS: The five novel very long chain N4, N9-diacyl polyamines: N4, N9-[diarachidoyl, diarachidonoyl, dieicosenoyl, dierucoyl and dinervonoyl]-1,12-diamino-4,9-diazadodecane were synthesized. The abilities of these novel compounds to condense DNA and to form nanoparticles were studied using ethidium bromide fluorescence quenching and nanoparticle characterization techniques. Transfection efficiency was studied in FEK4 primary skin cells and in an immortalized cancer cell line (HtTA), and compared with the non-liposomal transfection formulation Lipogen, N4, N9-dioleoyl-1,12-diamino-4,9-diazadodecane. Also, the abilities of these compounds to condense siRNA and to form nanoparticles were studied using a RiboGreen intercalation assay and their abilities to deliver siRNA into cells were studied in FEK4 and HtTA cells using fluorescein-labelled Label IT(R) RNAi Delivery Control, a sequenced 21-mer from Mirus. RESULTS: We show efficient pEGFP and siRNA formulation and delivery to primary skin and cancer cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: Adding two C20 or C22 chains, both mono-cis-unsaturated, N4, N9-dieicosenoyl spermine and N4, N9-dierucoyl spermine, gave efficient siRNA delivery vectors, even in the presence of serum, comparable to TransIT-TKO and with excellent cell viability.

"Eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) became an important animal model to study the immunological processes in hepatitis B virus infection. To facilitate further study of T-cell responses in this model, we cloned and sequenced the cDNAs of Woodchuck CD28 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which play important roles for the regulation of T-cell activation by delivering the costimulation signals. According to the deduced amino-acid sequences, Woodchuck CD28 showed a similarity of 70% to 80% to its mammalian homologues. Woodchuck CTLA-4 has a higher similarity of 74% to 85% to corresponding mammalian CTLA-4 molecules. The strict conservation of critical amino-acid residues like cystein and asparagine residues in Woodchuck CD28 and CTLA-4 suggests that both molecules may structurally resemble their human or mouse homologues. A hexapeptide motif, MYPPPY, which has been supposed to be essential for the interaction with CD80, is present in both Woodchuck CD28 and CTLA-4. The cloned cDNAs of Woodchuck CD28 and CTLA-4 were placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. Both proteins were expressed and detected by respective crossreactive antibodies in transiently transfected mammalian cells. By immunohistochemical staining with these antibodies, CD28 and CTLA-4 were also detected on cultured woodchuck peripheral blood lymphocytes. The molecular characterization of Woodchuck CD28 and CTLA-4 will facilitate studies on the T-cell response to hepadnavirus in the woodchuck model.

"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Despite advances in our knowledge of effective services for people who use drugs over the last decades globally, coverage remains poor in most countries, while quality is often unknown. This paper aims to discuss the historical development of successful epidemiological indicators and to present a framework for extending them with additional indicators of coverage and quality of harm reduction services, for monitoring and evaluation at international, national or subnational levels. The ultimate aim is to improve these services in order to reduce health and social problems among people who use drugs, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, crime and legal problems, overdose (death) and other morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: The framework was developed collaboratively using consensus methods involving nominal group meetings, review of existing quality standards, repeated email commenting rounds and qualitative analysis of opinions/experiences from a broad range of professionals/experts, including members of civil society and organisations representing people who use drugs. Twelve priority candidate indicators are proposed for opioid agonist therapy (OAT), needle and syringe programmes (NSP) and generic cross-cutting aspects of harm reduction (and potentially other drug) services. Under the specific OAT indicators, priority indicators included 'coverage', 'waiting list time', 'dosage' and 'availability in prisons'. For the specific NSP indicators, the priority indicators included 'coverage', 'number of needles/syringes distributed/collected', 'provision of other drug use paraphernalia' and 'availability in prisons'. Among the generic or cross-cutting indicators the priority indicators were 'infectious diseases counselling and care', 'take away naloxone', 'information on safe use/sex' and 'condoms'. We discuss conditions for the successful development of the suggested indicators and constraints (e.g. funding, ideology). We propose conducting a pilot study to test the feasibility and applicability of the proposed indicators before their scaling up and routine implementation, to evaluate their effectiveness in comparing service coverage and quality across countries. CONCLUSIONS: The establishment of an improved set of validated and internationally agreed upon best practice indicators for monitoring harm reduction service will provide a structural basis for public health and epidemiological studies and support evidence and human rights-based health policies, services and interventions.

"We previously described differences in the 50% protective dose and isotype-specific antibody secreting cell (ASC) responses to US and Russian influenza A cold-adapted (ca) donor strains in the lungs of BALB/c mice [Wareing MD, Watson JM, Brooks MJ, Tannock GA. Immunogenic and isotype-specific responses to Russian and US cold-adapted influenza A vaccine donor strains A/Leningrad/134/17/57, A/Leningrad/134/47/57, and A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) in mice. J Med Virol 2001;65(1):171-7]. A/Leningrad/134/17/57(Len/17-ca) was shown to be a superior immunogen to A/Leningrad/134/47/57-ca (Len/47-ca), which, in turn, was superior to A/Ann Arbor/6/60-ca (AA-ca) but no other comparative data exist. In order to extend our findings and determine a means for selecting the most immunogenic ca influenza A vaccine, the intracellular cytokine responses by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to AA-ca, Len/47-ca and Len/17-ca and their respective wild-type parental viruses were compared in mice. Day 5 after infection with Len/17-ca, when levels of IL-2, -4 and -10 were highest in the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) and lungs, was chosen as the optimum time to harvest lymphocytes and 72 h was determined to be the optimum re-stimulation period for lymphocytes by APCs. Under these conditions, the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing cytokines was highest in the lungs compared with the MLN. A dominant IL-6 response was induced, although all virus strains induced a Th1/Th2 cytokine profile. While the CD8+ cytokine response appeared non-specific, the cytokine response elicited in the lungs by CD4+ cells to Len/17-ca-inoculation was greater than that induced by Len/47-ca, or AA/ca. The CD4+ cytokine response in the lungs may be a useful measure of immunogenicity to determine the most effective influenza reassortant for inclusion in vaccines.

"The release of myxoma virus (MYXV) and Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) in Australia with the aim of controlling overabundant rabbits has provided a unique opportunity to study the initial spread and establishment of emerging pathogens, as well as their co-evolution with their mammalian hosts. In contrast to MYXV, which attenuated shortly after its introduction, rapid attenuation of RHDV has not been observed. By studying the change in virulence of recent field isolates at a single field site we show, for the first time, that RHDV virulence has increased through time, likely because of selection to overcome developing genetic resistance in Australian wild rabbits. High virulence also appears to be favoured as rabbit carcasses, rather than diseased animals, are the likely source of mechanical insect transmission. These findings not only help elucidate the co-evolutionary interaction between rabbits and RHDV, but reveal some of the key factors shaping virulence evolution.

"Members of the Flaviviridae encode a serine proteinase termed NS3 that is responsible for processing at several sites in the viral polyproteins. In this report, we show that the NS3 proteinase of the pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (NADL strain) is required for processing at nonstructural (NS) protein sites 3/4A, 4A/4B, 4B/5A, and 5A/5B but not for cleavage at the junction between NS2 and NS3. Cleavage sites of the proteinase were determined by amino-terminal sequence analysis of the NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B proteins. A conserved leucine residue is found at the P1 position of all four cleavage sites, followed by either serine (3/4A, 4B/5A, and 5A/5B sites) or alanine (4A/4B site) at the P1' position. Consistent with this cleavage site preference, a structural model of the pestivirus NS3 proteinase predicts a highly hydrophobic P1 specificity pocket. trans-Processing experiments implicate the 64-residue NS4A protein as an NS3 proteinase cofactor required for cleavage at the 4B/5A and 5A/5B sites. Finally, using a full-length functional BVDV cDNA clone, we demonstrate that a catalytically active NS3 serine proteinase is essential for pestivirus replication.

"Setting: A high tuberculosis (TB) incidence, resource-limited urban setting in Zimbabwe. Objectives: To compare treatment outcomes among people initiated on first-line anti-tuberculosis treatment in relation to age and other explanatory factors. Design: This was a retrospective record review of routine programme data. Results: Of 2209 patients included in the study, 133 (6%) were children (aged <10 years), 132 (6%) adolescents (10-19 years), 1782 (81%) adults (20-59 years) and 162 (7%) were aged ⩾60 years, defined as elderly. The highest proportion of smear-negative pulmonary TB cases was among the elderly (40%). Unfavourable outcomes, mainly deaths, increased proportionately with age, and were highest among the elderly (adjusted relative risk 3.8, 95%CI 1.3-10.7). Having previous TB, being human immunodeficiency virus positive and not on antiretroviral treatment or cotrimoxazole preventive therapy were associated with an increased risk of unfavourable outcomes. Conclusion: The elderly had the worst outcomes among all the age groups. This may be related to immunosuppressant comorbidities or other age-related diseases mis-classified as TB, as a significant proportion were smear-negative. Older persons need better adapted TB management and more sensitive diagnostic tools, such as Xpert(®) MTB/RIF.

"Sequence analysis predicts that herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) strain HG52 contains an open reading frame, RL1, encoding a polypeptide equivalent to ICP34.5 of HSV-1. Similarly to HSV-1, deletion of the region spanning RL1 abolishes the virulence of HSV-2 strain HG52 and its ability to grow in stationary 3T6 cells. In contrast to HSV-1, the HSV-2 strain HG52 RL1 gene is predicted to contain a 154 bp intron. Previously, we have demonstrated that this intron is spliced from RL1 poly(A)+ mRNA at the predicted splice donor/ acceptor sites. To determine if the intron affects the function of ICP34.5 of HSV-2 strain HG52, we have constructed a virus, 2624, in which the RL1 intron is deleted: 2624 retains wild-type growth both in vivo and in 3T6 cells, indicating that the presence of an intron does not affect the function of RL1 in HSV-2 strain HG52. 2624 has wild-type growth kinetics in BHK21/C13 cells.

"This study extends our previous observation that glycopeptides bind to class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and elicit carbohydrate-specific CTL responses. The Sendai virus nucleoprotein wild-type (WT) peptide (FAPGNYPAL) binds H-2Db using the P5-Asn as an anchor. The peptide K2 carrying a P5 serine substitution did not bind Db. Surprisingly, glycosylation of the serine (K2-O-GlcNAc) with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), a novel cytosolic O-linked glycosylation, partially restored peptide binding to Db. We argue that the N-acetyl group of GlcNAc may fulfil the hydrogen bonding requirements of the Db pocket which normally accomodates P5-Asn. Glycosylation of the P5-Asn residue itself abrogated binding similar to K2, probably for steric reasons. The peptide K2-O-GlcNAc readily elicited Db-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which did not cross-react with K2 or WT. However, all Db-restricted CTL raised against K2-O-GlcNAc cross-reacted strongly with another glycopeptide, K3-O-GlcNAc, where the GlcNAc substitution is on a neighboring P4-Ser. Furthermore, Db-restricted CTL clones raised against K2-O-GlcNAc or K3-O-GlcNAc displayed a striking TCR conservation. Our interpretation is that the carbohydrate of K2-O-GlcNAc not only mediates binding to Db, but also interacts with the TCR in such a way as to mimic K3-O-GlcNAc. This unusual example of molecular mimicry extends the known effects of peptide glycosylation from what we and others have previously reported: glycosylation may create a T cell neo-epitope, or, conversely, abrogate recognition. Alternatively, glycosylation may block peptide binding to MHC class I and finally, as reported here, restore binding, presumably through direct interaction of the carbohydrate with the MHC molecule.

"INTRODUCTION: The essential prerequisite for successful gene therapy in vivo is an effective and long-lasting transfer of the desired gene into the respective cell type or tissue. Over the last decades, many different methods have been developed for this purpose. The use of plasmid DNA seems to be a good alternative to the commonly used viral vectors because its large-scale production is simple, and side effects are low. Unfortunately, most reports describe only short-term expression in vivo, probably due to the lack of genomic integration in the target cell. This problem can possibly be addressed by the use of adeno-associated virus plasmids (AAV plasmids), where the coding sequences are cloned between the AAV-specific inverted terminal repeats. Here, we report our results after allogeneic heart transplantation, which followed AAV-plasmid-mediated gene transfer of the rat soluble major histocompatibility complex class I antigen RT1.A(a) and viral interleukin (vIL)-10 in the ""high""-responder Dark Agouti to Lewis rat strain combination. RESULTS: A high and stable long-term expression was achieved by in vivo transfection of the liver using AAV plasmids. Serum levels over 1,000 ng/ml of soluble RT1.A(a) and over 300 pg of vIL-10, respectively, were achieved. Expression levels remained high for up to several months. A mean prolongation of heart allograft survival of 1 to 2 days was demonstrated after transfection of either RT1.A(a) or vIL-10.

"A study has been made to clarify the importance of some carbohydrate components of goose red blood cell and BHK 21 cell membrane receptors for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Experiments have been carried out by inducing enzymatic modifications on the surface of intact cells and following the interaction between VSV and treated cells. Results obtained indicate that the removal of mannose, galactose and fucose from cell membranes reduces the attachment of the virus to cell receptors.

"Suppression of PKC activity can selectively induce apoptosis in cells expressing a constitutively activated p21Ras protein. We demonstrate that continued expression of p21Ras activity is required in PKC-mediated apoptosis because farnesyltransferase inhibitors abrogated the loss of viability in p21Ras-transformed cells occurring following PKC inhibition. Studies utilizing gene transfer or viral vectors demonstrate that transient expression of oncogenic p21Ras activity is sufficient for induction of apoptosis by PKC inhibition, whereas physiologic activation of p21Ras by growth factor is not sufficient to induce apoptosis. Mechanistically, the p21Ras-mediated apoptosis induced by PKC inhibition is dependent upon mitochondrial dysregulation, with a concurrent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (psim). Cyclosporine A, which prevented the loss of psim, also inhibited HMG-induced DNA fragmentation in cells expressing an activated p21Ras. Induction of apoptosis by PKC inhibition in human tumors with oncogenic p21Ras mutations was demonstrated. Inhibition of PKC caused increased apoptosis in MIA-PaCa-2, a human pancreatic tumor line containing a mutated Ki-ras allele, when compared to HS766T, a human pancreatic tumor line with normal Ki-ras alleles. Furthermore, PKC inhibition induced apoptosis in HCT116, a human colorectal tumor line containing an oncogenic Ki-ras allele but not in a subline (Hke3) in which the mutated Ki-ras allele had been disrupted. The PKC inhibitor 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycerol (HMG), significantly reduced p21Ras-mediated tumor growth in vivo in a nude mouse MIA-PaCa-2 xenograft model. Collectively these studies suggest the therapeutic feasibility of targeting PKC activity in tumors expressing an activated p21Ras oncoprotein.

"The World Health Organization estimates human mortality from endemic canine rabies to be 55,000 deaths/year. Limited supply hampers the accessibility of appropriate lifesaving treatment, particularly in areas where rabies is endemic. Anti-rabies antibodies are key to protection against lethal rabies. Currently, only human and equine polyclonal anti-rabies immune globulin (HRIG and ERIG) is available. Replacement of HRIG and ERIG with a safer and more widely available product is recommended. We have recently identified a combination of 2 human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), CR57 and CR4098, that has high potential. We here describe a head-to-head comparison between an CR57/CR4098 MAb cocktail and HRIG. The MAb cocktail neutralized all viruses from a panel of 26 representative street rabies virus isolates. In combination with vaccine, the MAb cocktail protected Syrian hamsters against lethal rabies when administered 24 h after exposure, comparable with the results obtained with HRIG. Furthermore, the MAb cocktail did not interfere with rabies vaccine differently from HRIG. These results demonstrate that the human MAb cocktail of CR57 and CR4098 is a safe and efficacious alternative to RIG in rabies postexposure prophylaxis.

"The dilute (d) coat color mutation on chromosome 9 is closely associated with an ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) genome [Jenkins, N.A., Copeland, N.G., Taylor, B.A. & Lee, B.K. (1981) Nature 293, 370-374]. DBA/2J mice homozygous for the reverse mutation to wild type at the dilute locus (d+2J) lack ecotropic virus-specific sequences, suggesting that the dilute mutation was caused by virus integration. In the experiments described here, we analyzed the ecotropic MuLV DNA content of mice that collectively carry 10 different alleles at the agouti coat color locus (of chromosome 2) to determine whether any of these alleles also are associated with ecotropic virus sequences. Of the 10 alleles analyzed, one allele, lethal yellow (Ay), which is carried congeneically and heterozygously on C57BL/6J, 129/Sv, and LT/Sv mice, was closely associated with an ecotropic MuLV provirus. The close association of this provirus with the Ay allele suggests that this mutation also may be caused by virus integration. Furthermore, this association may be useful for molecular cloning and characterizing the many alleles at this locus.

"In the early 1980s, a highly contagious viral hemorrhagic fever in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) emerged, causing a very high rate of mortality in these animals. Since the initial occurrence of the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), several hundred million rabbits have died after infection. The emergence of genetically-different virus variants (RHDV GI.1 and GI.2) indicated the very high variability of RHDV. Moreover, with these variants, the host range broadened to hare species (Lepus). The circulation of RHDV genotypes displays different virulences and a limited induction of cross-protective immunity. Interestingly, juvenile rabbits (<9 weeks of age) with an immature immune system display a general resistance to RHDV GI.1, and a limited resistance to RHDV GI.2 strains, whereas less than 3% of adult rabbits survive an infection by either RHDV GI.1. or GI.2. Several not-yet fully understood phenomena characterize the RHD. A very low infection dose followed by an extremely rapid viral replication could be simplified to the induction of a disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), a severe loss of lymphocytes-especially T-cells-and death within 36 to 72 h post infection. On the other hand, in animals surviving the infection or after vaccination, very high titers of RHDV-neutralizing antibodies were induced. Several studies have been conducted in order to deepen the knowledge about the virus' genetics, epidemiology, RHDV-induced pathology, and the anti-RHDV immune responses of rabbits in order to understand the phenomenon of the juvenile resistance to this virus. Moreover, several approaches have been used to produce efficient vaccines in order to prevent an infection with RHDV. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge about anti-RHDV resistance and immunity, RHDV vaccination, and the further need to establish rationally-based RHDV vaccines.

"The cyclic dinucleotide (CDN)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway plays an important role in the detection of viral and bacterial pathogens in animals. Previous studies have shown that the metazoan second messenger cyclic [G(2',5')pA(3',5')p] (2',3'-cGAMP) generated by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase cGAS binds STING with high affinity compared with bacterial CDNs such as c-di-GMP, c-di-AMP, and 3',3'-cGAMP. Despite recent progress indicating that the CDN-binding domain (CBD) of dimeric STING binds asymmetric 2',3'-cGAMP preferentially over symmetric 3',3'-CDNs, it remains an open question whether STING molecules, such as human STING, adopt a symmetric dimeric conformation to efficiently engage its asymmetric ligand. Here, structural studies of the CBD from porcine STING (STING(CBD)) in complex with CDNs at 1.76-2.6 Å resolution revealed that porcine STING(CBD), unlike its human and mouse counterparts, can adopt an asymmetric ligand-binding pocket to accommodate the CDNs. We observed that the extensive interactions and shape complementarity between asymmetric 2',3'-cGAMP and the ligand-binding pocket make it the most preferred ligand for porcine STING and that geometry constraints limit the binding between symmetric 3',3'-CDN and porcine STING. The ligand-discrimination mechanism of porcine STING observed here expands our understanding of how the CDN-STING pathway is activated and of its role in antiviral defense.

"Viral quasispecies may contain a subset of minority genomes that reflect those genomic sequences that were dominant at an early phase of quasispecies evolution. Such minority genomes are referred to as memory in viral quasispecies. A memory marker previously characterized in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is an internal oligoadenylate tract of variable length that became dominant upon serial plaque-to-plaque transfers of FMDV clones. During large population passages, genomes with internal oligoadenylate were outcompeted by wild-type revertants but remained in the mutant spectra as memory genomes. Here, we report a quantification of relative fitness of several FMDV clones, harboring internal oligoadenylate tracts of different length, and that were retrieved at early or late times (passage number) after implementation of memory. The results show that for any given length range of the oligoadenylate, maintenance in memory resulted in an increase in relative fitness, comparable to the increase undergone by the entire population. The fitness increase is in agreement with the Red Queen hypothesis, and implies a replicative memory mechanism. Thus, permanence of memory genomes may be a source of high fitness variants despite their initial low fitness, and despite having remained hidden in mutant spectra. This reinforces the interest of diagnosing minority genomes during chronic human and animal viral infections.

"Based on previous structural and functional studies, a potential receptor-binding site composed of residues that form a pocket at one end of the two long antiparallel helices in the receptor-binding domain of Friend 57 murine leukemia virus envelope protein (RBD) has been proposed. To test this hypothesis, directed substitutions for residues in the pocket were introduced and consequences for infection and for receptor binding were measured. Receptor binding was measured initially by a sensitive assay based on coexpression of receptor and RBD in Xenopus oocytes, and the findings were confirmed by using purified proteins. Three residues that are critical for both binding and infection (S84, D86, and W102), with side chains that extend into the pocket, were identified. Moreover, when mCAT-1 was overexpressed, the infectivity of Fr57-MLV carrying pocket substitutions was partially restored. Substitutions for 18 adjacent residues and 11 other previously unexamined surface-exposed residues outside of the RBD pocket had no detectable effect on function. Taken together, these findings support a model in which the RBD pocket interacts directly with mCAT-1 (likely residues, Y235 and E237) and multiple receptor-envelope complexes are required to form the fusion pore.

"The natural life cycle of alphaviruses, a group of plus-strand RNA viruses, involves transmission to vertebrate hosts via mosquitoes. Chronic infections are established in mosquitoes (and usually in mosquito cell cultures), but infection of susceptible vertebrate cells typically results in rapid shutoff of host mRNA translation and cell death. Using engineered Sindbis virus RNA replicons expressing puromycin acetyltransferase as a dominant selectable marker, we identified mutations allowing persistent, noncytopathic replication in BHK-21 cells. Two of these adaptive mutations involved single-amino-acid substitutions in the C-terminal portion of nsP2, the viral helicase-protease. At one of these loci, nsP2 position 726, numerous substitution mutations were created and characterized in the context of RNA replicons and infectious virus. Our results suggest a direct correlation between the level of viral RNA replication and cytopathogenicity. This work also provides a series of alphavirus replicons for noncytopathic gene expression studies (E. V. Agapov, I. Frolov, B. D. Lindenbach, B. M. Prágai, S. Schlesinger, and C. M. Rice, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:12989-12994, 1998) and a general strategy for selecting RNA viral mutants adapted to different cellular environments.

"Orthohantaviruses are negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses harbored by multiple small mammals. Dobrava-Belgrade virus (DOBV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Europe. In Poland, serological surveys have demonstrated antibodies against DOBV and PUUV in patients with HFRS. Molecular evidence of DOBV and PUUV has been found in Apodemus flavicollis and Myodes glareolus, respectively, in southeastern Poland, and Seewis virus (SWSV) has been reported in Sorex araneus in central Poland. However, data on the geographic distribution and phylogeny of orthohantaviruses are unavailable for other regions in Poland. To ascertain the prevalence and genetic diversity of orthohantaviruses in western and northern Poland, lung tissues from 106 small mammals were analyzed for the presence of orthohantavirus RNA. DOBV and SWSV were detected in two of 42 (4.8%) Apodemus agrarius and in three of 10 (30%) S. araneus, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of partial L- and S-segment sequences of DOBV indicated a shared genetic lineage with the Kurkino genotype from Slovakia, Russia, and Hungary, whereas the partial M segment of DOBV clustered with the Kurkino genotype from Germany. Phylogenetic relationships of the SWSV L and S segments showed a geographic lineage with SWSV strains from central Poland, Czech Republic, and Germany. In conclusion, the study provides insights into the molecular prevalence, phylogenetic diversity, and evolutionary relationship of DOBV in A. agrarius and SWSV in S. araneus. This report increases awareness among physicians for HFRS outbreaks in western Poland.

"Climate change threatens human health, but there remains a lack of evidence on the economic toll of climate-sensitive public health impacts. We characterize human mortality and morbidity costs associated with 10 climate-sensitive case study events spanning 11 US states in 2012: wildfires in Colorado and Washington, ozone air pollution in Nevada, extreme heat in Wisconsin, infectious disease outbreaks of tick-borne Lyme disease in Michigan and mosquito-borne West Nile virus in Texas, extreme weather in Ohio, impacts of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York, allergenic oak pollen in North Carolina, and harmful algal blooms on the Florida coast. Applying a consistent economic valuation approach to published studies and state estimates, we estimate total health-related costs from 917 deaths, 20,568 hospitalizations, and 17,857 emergency department visits of $10.0 billion in 2018 dollars, with a sensitivity range of $2.7-24.6 billion. Our estimates indicate that the financial burden of deaths, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and associated medical care is a key dimension of the overall economic impact of climate-sensitive events. We found that mortality costs (i.e., the value of a statistical life) of $8.4 billion exceeded morbidity costs and lost wages ($1.6 billion combined). By better characterizing health damages in economic terms, this work helps to shed light on the burden climate-sensitive events already place on U.S. public health each year. In doing so, we provide a conceptual framework for broader estimation of climate-sensitive health-related costs. The high health-related costs associated with climate-sensitive events highlight the importance of actions to mitigate climate change and adapt to its unavoidable impacts.

"To analyze the molecular basis of MHC class I allele-restricted peptide recognition, a set of eight Ld/Lq mutants was constructed and tested for peptide recognition by allele-restricted and peptide-specific CTL. The MHC molecules H-2Ld and H-2Lq differ at six amino acid positions (95, 97, 107, 116, 155, 157) located within the alpha 2 domain of the molecule. Both molecules present the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) nucleoprotein-derived peptide RPQASGVYM and the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) pp89-derived peptide YPHFMPTNL to the respective virus-specific CD8+ CTL is a strictly allele-restricted fashion. All mutated MHC class I molecules did still bind the LCMV peptide and seven of eight mutants retained MCMV peptide binding. The exchange Arg-->Trp at position 97 of Lq in pocket C of the peptide binding groove prevented binding of the MCMV ligand and this loss was compensated by the additional exchange of Ile-->Leu in position 95 (pocket F). Within the Lq molecule, single mutations at either position 97 on the floor of the groove or position 155 of the wall sufficed for a gain of LCMV peptide recognition by Ld-restricted CTL. Altogether, six of eight mutants resulted in a gain of recognition by CTL specific for the other allele. Thus, six of the eight mutants lost MHC-restricted recognition and were accepted by both Ld- as well as Lq-restricted CTL when presenting the LCMV peptide. Only one case of simultaneous recognition of the MCMV peptide by both Ld- as well as Lq-restricted CTL was noted. In other mutations, a gain of recognition by Ld-restricted CTL was associated with a loss of recognition of Lq-restricted CTL. Analysis of extracted MCMV peptide from mutant molecules excluded quantitative differences in presented MCMV peptide as a reason for the lack of CTL recognition. Altogether, the results show that, rather than aminoacids at certain residue positions, individual peptides govern MHC allele specificity of CTL recognition.

"Insulin-producing cells and fibroblasts were fused to produce hybrid lines. In hybrids derived from both hamster and rat insulinoma cells, no insulin mRNA could be detected in any of seven lines examined by Northern (RNA) analysis despite the presence in each line of the insulin genes of both parental cells. Hybrid cells were transfected with recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids containing defined segments of the rat insulin I gene 5' flank. We observed no transcriptional activity of the intact insulin enhancer or of IEB2, a critical cis-acting element of the insulin enhancer. IEB2 has previously been shown to interact in vitro with IEF1, a DNA-binding activity observed selectively in insulin-producing cells. Hybrid cells showed no detectable IEF1 activity. Furthermore, the insulin enhancer was unable to reduce transcription directed by the Moloney sarcoma virus enhancer in a double-enhancer construct. Thus, extinction of insulin gene expression in the hybrids apparently does not operate through a direct action of repressors on the insulin enhancer; rather, extinction is accompanied by, and may be caused by, reduced DNA-binding activity of the putative transcriptional activator IEF1.

"Sharp reductions in the wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus (L.)) population in the Mallee are associated with annual myxomatosis epizootics. The extent to which the population reductions are the direct result of the epizootics varies with time of epizootic occurrence. All grazing animals in the Mallee are under nutritional stress each summer and autumn. When the epizootic occurs during the early summer heavy losses occur in a previously healthy population. Similar losses which occur in the late summer and autumn are the result of a nutritional stress - epizootic complex. The end result in each case is a population reduction of about 80%. This reduction occurs in a population which is the most resistant to myxomatosis known in Victoria and in association with epizootics caused by field strains of myxoma virus of moderate virulence only. The earlier summer epizootics are of considerable economic importance because they sharply reduce the pressure on the limited food available for other grazing animals.
"
"The occurrence of antibody of myxoma virus in wild rabbits following epizootics is highest in the semi-arid north-west of Victoria and lowest in temperate southern Victoria. Occurrence ranges up to about 90% in the north-west and to about 70% in the south except on the Western Plains where epizootics are rare and antibody occurrence seldom exceeds 30%. The establishment of the European rabbit flea may be changing the pattern of occurrence of antibody in the north-west by causing spring outbreaks of myxomatosis. It is suggested that the effects of the replacement of a simple recurring system of epizootic and breeding season several months apart by the occurrence of myxomatosis twice in the same year, once coincident with the breeding season, will be complex. The occurrence of detectable antibody may be less dependent on the infection rate and may be dependent to some extent on the relative timing of spring myxomatosis and the breeding season.

"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was used as a model virus to study the processes involved in photoinactivation by aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (AlPcS4) or silicon phthalocyanine HOSiPcOSi(CH3)2(CH2)3N(CH3)2 (Pc4) and red light. Previously a very rapid decrease in the intracellular viral RNA synthesis after photodynamic treatment was observed. This decrease was correlated to different steps in the replication cycle. Binding of VSV to host cells and internalization were only slightly impaired and could be visualized by electron microscopy. The capability of the virus to fuse with membranes in an acidic endosomal environment was studied using both pyrene-labeled liposomes and a hemolysis assay as a model. These tests indicate a rapid decrease of fusion capacity after AlPcS4 treatment, which correlated with the decrease in RNA synthesis. For Pc4 treatment no such correlation was found. The fusion process is the first step in the replication cycle, affected by AlPcS4 treatment, but also in vitro RNA polymerase activity was previously shown to be inhibited. Inactivation of VSV by Pc4 treatment is apparently caused by damage to a variety of viral components. Photodynamic treatment of virus suspensions with both sensitizers causes formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine in viral RNA as measured by HPLC with electrochemical detection. This damage might be partly responsible for inhibition of the in vitro viral RNA polymerase activity by photodynamic treatment.

"BACKGROUND: Few data exist on the efficacy of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in semen of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected men who have sex with men (MSM) with sustained control of HIV replication in blood. METHODS: HIV-1 infected MSM on successful cART for >6 months were enrolled. HIV-RNA was quantified in seminal plasma (spVL) and in blood plasma (bpVL) from 2 paired samples collected 4 weeks apart. Relationship between spVL and bpVL (measured by an ultrasensitive assay, LOQ 10 copies/mL), total peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)-associated HIV-DNA, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and self-reported socio-behavioral characteristics was assessed using GEE logistic regression. RESULTS: In total, 157 patients were included. Median time with bpVL <50 copies/mL was 3.3 years. spVL was detectable in 23/304 samples (prevalence 7.6%). Median spVL was 145 cp/mL (100-1475). spVL was detectable on the first, on the second, and on both samples in 5, 14, and 2 men, respectively. In sum, 33 individuals (21%) had STIs (asymptomatic in 24/33). Residual bpVL was undetectable by ultrasensitive assay in 225/300 samples (75%). After multivariable adjustments, PBMC-associated HIV-DNA (OR 2.6[1.2; 6.0], for HIV-DNA > 2.5 log10 cp/10(6) PBMC, P = .02), and cannabis use during sexual intercourse (OR 2.8[1.2; 6.7], P = .02) were the only factors associated significantly with spVL. CONCLUSION: We show that HIV-RNA can be detected intermittently in semen of HIV-1 infected MSM despite successful cART. The size of blood HIV-1 reservoir predicted spVL detection. Our results indicated also that the possible effect of cannabis should be taken into account when developing prevention interventions targeted toward HIV-infected MSM on successful cART.

"Attachment proteins from the surface of eukaryotic cells, bacteria and viruses are critical receptors in cell adhesion or signaling and are primary targets for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. It is proposed that the ligand-binding pocket in receptor proteins can shift between inactive and active conformations with weak and strong ligand-binding capability, respectively. Here, using monoclonal antibodies against a vaccine target protein - fimbrial adhesin FimH of uropathogenic Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that unusually strong receptor inhibition can be achieved by antibody that binds within the binding pocket and displaces the ligand in a non-competitive way. The non-competitive antibody binds to a loop that interacts with the ligand in the active conformation of the pocket but is shifted away from ligand in the inactive conformation. We refer to this as a parasteric inhibition, where the inhibitor binds adjacent to the ligand in the binding pocket. We showed that the receptor-blocking mechanism of parasteric antibody differs from that of orthosteric inhibition, where the inhibitor replaces the ligand or allosteric inhibition where the inhibitor binds at a site distant from the ligand, and is very potent in blocking bacterial adhesion, dissolving surface-adherent biofilms and protecting mice from urinary bladder infection.

"In Western countries, tobacco smoking is highly prevalent among patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). In the era of antiretrovirals and HCV cure, smoking-related health damages contribute greatly to morbidity and mortality in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. We used longitudinal data from the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort to identify the correlates of tobacco smoking quit attempts (TSQA) in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. TSQA were modelled using a multivariable discrete-time Cox proportional hazards model in 695 HIV-HCV co-infected tobacco smokers. HCV cure was associated with a 76% higher chance of TSQA (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.76 [1.06-2.93], p = 0.029), and cannabis use with a 37% lower chance (0.63 [0.40-1.00], p = 0.049), independently of the mode of HIV transmission, other psychoactive substance use, and body mass index. Patients should be screened for tobacco and cannabis use at HCV treatment initiation and during follow-up. They should also be provided with comprehensive counselling and referral to addiction services. Non-smoking routes of cannabis administration should be promoted for cannabis users who wish to quit smoking tobacco.

"Strains of equine arteritis virus (EAV) differ in their virulence phenotypes, causing anywhere from subclinical infections to severe disease in horses. Here, we describe the in silico design and de novo synthesis of a full-length infectious cDNA clone of the horse-adapted virulent Bucyrus strain (VBS) of EAV encoding mCherry along with in vitro characterization of the progeny virions (EAV sVBSmCherry) in terms of host-cell tropism, replicative capacity and stability of the mCherry coding sequences following sequential passage in cell culture. The relative stability of the mCherry sequence during sequential cell culture passage coupled with a comparable host-cell range phenotype (equine endothelial cells, CD3(+) T cells and CD14(+) monocytes) to parental EAV VBS suggest that EAV-sVBSmCherry-derived virus could become a valuable research tool for identification of host-cell tropism determinants and for characterization of the viral proteins involved in virus attachment and entry into different subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that advances in nucleic acid synthesis technology permit synthesis of complex viral genomes with overlapping genes like those of arteriviruses, thereby circumventing the need for complicated molecular cloning techniques. In summary, de novo nucleic acid synthesis technology facilitates innovative viral vector design without the tedium and risks posed by more-conventional laboratory techniques.

"Genetic alteration of stem cells ex vivo followed by bone marrow transplantation could potentially be used in the treatment of numerous diseases and malignancies. However, there are many unanswered questions as to the best source of hematopoietic cells for long-term reengraftment and the most effective way to introduce foreign genes into this target cell. We have compared retroviral-mediated gene transfer into CD34+-enriched cells derived from peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), or fetal umbilical cord blood (CB). Cells from all three sources that had been expanded ex vivo in the presence of stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) showed transduction efficiencies ranging from 5-45%, as measured by acquisition of G418 resistance. The average efficiencies of gene transfer from multiple experiments for PB, BM, and CB were not statistically different. To determine the effect of ex vivo expansion on gene transfer into CB CD34+ cells, we compared the transduction efficiencies of cells exposed to virus immediately after harvest and CD34 selection or after 6 days of culture CD34+ CB cells were more effectively transduced after expansion in culture, showing gene transfer efficiencies 3- to 5-fold higher on day 6 compared with day 0. Last, we examined retroviral transduction via spinoculation of CB CD34+ cells and found it to be approximately as effective as our standard transduction with no significant loss of cell viability as measured by colony formation in semi-solid medium.

"Lentiviral replication mediated by reverse transcriptase is considered to be highly error prone, leading to a high intra-individual evolution rate that promotes evasion of neutralization and persistent infection. Understanding lentiviral intra-individual evolutionary dynamics on a comparative basis can therefore inform research strategies to aid in studies of pathogenesis, vaccine design, and therapeutic intervention. We conducted a systematic review of intra-individual evolution rates for three species groups of lentiviruses-feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, intra-individual rate estimates differed by virus but not by host, gene, or viral strain. Lentiviral infections in spillover (nonadapted) hosts approximated infections in primary (adapted) hosts. Our review consistently documents that FIV evolution rates within individuals are significantly lower than the rates recorded for HIV and SIV. FIV intra-individual evolution rates were noted to be equivalent to FIV interindividual rates. These findings document inherent differences in the evolution of FIV relative to that of primate lentiviruses, which may signal intrinsic difference of reverse transcriptase between these viral species or different host-viral interactions. Analysis of lentiviral evolutionary selection pressures at the individual versus population level is valuable for understanding transmission dynamics and the emergence of virulent and avirulent strains and provides novel insight for approaches to interrupt lentiviral infections.IMPORTANCE To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compares intra-individual evolution rates for FIV, SIV, and HIV following systematic review of the literature. Our findings have important implications for informing research strategies in the field of intra-individual virus dynamics for lentiviruses. We observed that FIV evolves more slowly than HIV and SIV at the intra-individual level and found that mutation rates may differ by gene sequence length but not by host, gene, strain, an experimental setting relative to a natural setting, or spillover host infection relative to primary host infection.

"Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis cremnobates), a domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were used as bait animals to collect blood-feeding flies in an area of active blue-tongue and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus transmission. Precipitin tests were used to confirm the blood source where feasible. Eight species of Culicoides, members of the Leptoconops kerteszi group, Simulium spp., Anopheles franciscanus, and Stomoxys calcitrans were collected from the bighorn sheep. Feeding on the bighorn sheep by Culicoides brookmani (n = 25), C. variipennis (n = 6), C. cacticola (n = 1), and Simulium spp. (n = 3) was confirmed by precipitin testing. Primary species attacking the rabbit were C. brookmani, C. variipennis, and the L. kerteszi group. The quail were attacked primarily by members of the C. copiosus group and the L. kerteszi group.

"INTRODUCTION: Despite the advent of HIV cure-related clinical trials (HCRCT) for people living with HIV (PLWH), the risks and uncertainty involved raise ethical issues. Although research has provided insights into the levers and barriers to PLWH and physicians' participation in these trials, no information exists about stakeholders' preferences for HCRCT attributes, about the different ways PLWH and physicians value future HCRCT, or about how personal characteristics affect these preferences. The results from the present study will inform researchers' decisions about the most suitable HCRCT strategies to implement, and help them ensure ethical recruitment and well-designed informed consent. METHODS: Between October 2016 and March 2017, a discrete choice experiment was conducted among 195 virally controlled PLWH and 160 physicians from 24 French HIV centres. Profiles within each group, based on individual characteristics, were obtained using hierarchical clustering. Trade-offs between five HCRCT attributes (trial duration, consultation frequency, moderate (digestive disorders, flu-type syndrome, fatigue) and severe (allergy, infections, risk of cancer) side effects (SE), outcomes) and utilities associated with four HCRCT candidates (latency reactivation, immunotherapy, gene therapy and a combination of latency reactivation and immunotherapy), were estimated using a mixed logit model. RESULTS: Apart from severe SE - the most decisive attribute in both groups - PLWH and physicians made different trade-offs between HCRCT attributes, the latter being more concerned about outcomes, the former about the burden of participation (consultation frequency and moderate SE). These different trades-offs resulted in differences in preferences regarding the four candidate HCRCT. PLWH significantly preferred immunotherapy, whereas physicians preferred immunotherapy and combined therapy. Despite the heterogeneity of characteristics within the PLWH and physician profiles, results show some homogeneity in trade-offs and utilities regarding HCRCT. CONCLUSIONS: Severe SE, not outcomes, was the most decisive attribute determining future HCRCT participation. Particular attention should be paid to providing clear information, in particular on severe SE, to potential participants. Immunotherapy would appear to be the best HCRCT candidate for both PLWH and physicians. However, if the risk of cancer could be avoided, gene therapy would become the preferred strategy for the latter and the second choice for the former.

"Brain samples were collected from 514 voles and wild mice in Estonia, and examined for rabies. The samples were tested with antigen ELISA, and 8.6% of them additionally by virus isolation assay. The results were negative. Our data show that in areas of north-eastern Europe, where rabies is endemic in raccoon dogs and red foxes, populations of smaller mammals may remain free of rabies.

"Although antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza infection, it is an urgent requirement to develop new antiviral drugs regarding the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. The nucleoprotein (NP) is conserved among all influenza A viruses (IAVs) and has no cellular equivalent. Therefore, NP is an ideal target for the development of new IAV inhibitors. In this study, we identified a novel anti-influenza compound, ZBMD-1, from a library of 20,000 compounds using cell-based influenza A infection assays. We found that ZBMD-1 inhibited the replication of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A virus strains in vitro, with an IC(50) ranging from 0.41-1.14 μM. Furthermore, ZBMD-1 inhibited the polymerase activity and specifically impaired the nuclear export of NP. Further investigation indicated that ZBMD-1 binds to the nuclear export signal 3 (NES3) domain and the dimer interface of the NP pocket. ZBMD-1 also protected mice that were challenged with lethal doses of A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, effectively relieving lung histopathology changes, as well as strongly inhibiting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, without inducing toxicity effects in mice. These results suggest that ZBMD-1 is a promising anti-influenza compound which can be further investigated as a useful strategy against IAVs in the future.

"Pima County, Ariz., is currently investigating the potential benefits of land application of sewage sludge. To assess risks associated with the presence of pathogenic enteric viruses present in the sludge, laboratory studies were conducted to measure the inactivation rate (k = log(10) reduction per day) of poliovirus type 1 and bacteriophages MS2 and PRD-1 in two sludge-amended desert agricultural soils (Brazito Sandy Loam and Pima Clay Loam). Under constant moisture (approximately -0.05 x 10 Pa for both soils) and temperatures of 15, 27, and 40 degrees C, the main factors controlling the inactivation of these viruses were soil temperature and texture. As the temperature increased from 15 to 40 degrees C, the inactivation rate increased significantly for poliovirus and MS2, whereas, for PRD-1, a significant increase in the inactivation rate was observed only at 40 degrees C. Clay loam soils afforded more protection to all three viruses than sandy soils. At 15 degrees C, the inactivation rate for MS2 ranged from 0.366 to 0.394 log(10) reduction per day in clay loam and sandy loam soils, respectively. At 27 degrees C, this rate increased to 0.629 log(10) reduction per day in clay loam soil and to 0.652 in sandy loam soil. A similar trend was observed for poliovirus at 15 degrees C (k = 0.064 log(10) reduction per day, clay loam; k = 0.095 log(10) reduction per day, sandy loam) and 27 degrees C (k = 0.133 log(10) reduction per day, clay loam; k = 0.154 log(10) reduction per day, sandy loam). Neither MS2 nor poliovirus was recovered after 24 h at 40 degrees C. No reduction of PRD-1 was observed after 28 days at 15 degrees C and after 16 days at 27 degrees C. At 40 degrees C, the inactivation rates were 0.208 log(10) reduction per day in amended clay loam soil and 0.282 log(10) reduction per day in sandy loam soil. Evaporation to less than 5% soil moisture completely inactivated all three viruses within 7 days at 15 degrees C, within 3 days at 27 degrees C, and within 2 days at 40 degrees C regardless of soil type. This suggests that a combination of high soil temperature and rapid loss of soil moisture will significantly reduce risks caused by viruses in sludge.

"OBJECTIVE: In order to better understand the epidemiological features of Hantviruses in Inner Mongolia. METHODS: Epidemiological surveillance data during the period of the past 52 years were analyzed. An epidemiological survey was carried out in the main epidemic areas in 2005. RESULTS: A total of 8310 hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) cases were reported in Inner Mongolia from 1955 to 2006, and distributed in 61 counties. HFRS cases were mainly distributed in the east part of Inner Mongolia before 1990. However, HFRS cases had occurred in the middle and western parts since 1990. Hulunbeier prefecture, from the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, had been the most severe area being hit by HERS since the first outbreak in 1955, with 7369 cases reported over the past 52 years, and accounted for 88.68% of the total cases in the whole autonomous region. Although no HFRS cases had been reported before 1999 in Bayannaoer which located in the western part of Inner Mongolia, a total of 95 cases were reported in 2005. Hantavirus antigens had been detected in 11 species of rodents so far,including Apodemus agrarius, Rattus norvegicus, Mus Musculus, Cricetulus barabensis, meriones meridianus, Microtus maximowiczii , Clethrionomys rutilus, Apodemus peninsulae, Phodopus roborvskii, Dipus sagitta and Allactaga sibirica. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that the epidemics might remain at a relatively high level in the years to come in Inner Mongolia. Furthermore, there might be other types of Hantaviruses in addition to the already identified Seoul viral type in this area.

"Retroviruses require a balance of spliced and unspliced RNA for efficient replication. Here, we examined the effect of mutations in a splicing suppressor sequence called the negative regulator of splicing (NRS), located within the gag gene of Rous sarcoma virus. While the NRS mutant viruses showed only small changes in the levels of spliced env mRNAs, they had significant increases in src mRNA levels and transformed cells more efficiently than wild-type virus. None of these mutations prevented viral replication; however, some of the mutant viruses replicated more slowly than wild-type virus. In addition, increased transcriptional readthrough of the poly(A) site in the 3' LTR was observed with the NRS mutant viruses, suggesting that the wild-type NRS sequence promotes polyadenylation.

"Nicotine, acting through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), increases the firing rate of both orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), yet nicotine and other nAChR agonists decrease food intake in mice. Viral-mediated knockdown of the β4 nAChR subunit in all neuronal cell types in the ARC prevents the nicotinic agonist cytisine from decreasing food intake, but it is not known whether the β4 subunit is selectively expressed in anorexigenic neurons or how other nAChR subtypes are distributed in this nucleus. Using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) on ARC tissue from mice with ribosomes tagged in either AgRP or POMC cells, we examined nAChR subunit mRNA levels using real-time PCR. Both AgRP and POMC cells express a comparable panel of nAChR subunits with differences in α7 mRNA levels and a trend for difference in α4 levels, but no differences in β4 expression. Immunoprecipitation of assembled nAChRs revealed that the β4 subunit forms assembled channels with α3, β2 and α4, but not other subunits found in the ARC. Finally, using cell type-selective, virally delivered small hairpin RNAs targeting either the β4 or α7 subunit, we examined the contribution of each subunit in either AgRP or POMC cells to the behavioural response to nicotine, refining the understanding of nicotinic regulation of this feeding circuit. These experiments identify a more complex set of nAChRs expressed in ARC than in other hypothalamic regions. Thus, the ARC appears to be a particular target of nicotinic modulation.

"Over the past several years, significant progress has been made in the development of non-viral methodologies that can effectively deliver genes to target tissues in vivo. One of the most surprising successes has been the discovery that naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) can be delivered into tissues such as liver and muscle with high efficiency using the vascular system. The key breakthrough involved the realization that pDNA could be injected rapidly into blood vessels (using increased volumes) in a manner that facilitates extravasation of the DNA solution outside the blood vessel wall. The extravasation process places the DNA in contact with the plasma membranes of the underlying parenchymal cells of the target organ. This intravascular delivery technique, termed 'hydrodynamic delivery', has become established as the primary non-viral methodology for delivering pDNA expression constructs to target tissues in vivo. This review highlights many of the most recent studies in which increased volume/rapid injection procedures have been used. These include studies in which the technology was used as a new and powerful tool to address in vivo gene expression questions, as well as numerous studies that were designed to better understand or improve the methodology. It is these scientific efforts that have served to fuel the development of this delivery technology from simply an interesting phenomenon to a highly useful and broadly used gene delivery methodology.

"BACKGROUND: To study the molecular epidemiology of the influenza outbreaks in nursing homes (NHs) to determine whether multiple influenza strains were involved. METHODS: From September to December 2014, NHs in Corsica were invited to participate in an ongoing daily epidemiological and microbiological surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) among residents and health care workers (HCWs). RESULTS: The study involved 12 NHs. Respiratory illness meeting the ILI case definition was observed among 44 residents from whom 22 specimens were collected. Of the 22 residents with a nasopharyngeal sample, 13 (59 %) were positive for at least one of the 11 pathogens analysed. Among these 13 patients, 11 (92 %) presented a confirmed influenza (A/H3N2) and two had another respiratory virus: one human metapneumovirus and one human coronavirus. Of patients with a confirmed influenza A(H3N2), 10 (91 %) were vaccinated against influenza during the 2014-2015 season. Two influenza outbreaks were reported in two NHs, caused by influenza A(H3N2) strains belonging to cluster 3C.3 and 3C.2a. Although antivirals were available, prophylaxis was not used. CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis seems to suggest no multiple introduction into the two NHs reporting the two influenza A(H3N2) outbreaks. A number of factors could have contributed to transmitting influenza in NHs including, the absence of administration of antiviral treatment for prophylaxis of all residents/staff regardless of immunization status because of the poor vaccine match during each outbreak, the intensive contacts with incompletely protected residents and HCWs, and the low adherence of NHs to notification of ILI outbreaks to the health authorities.

"In contrast with other macrophage (MO) populations, there is little information on the antiviral resistance in vitro of isolated liver MO (Kupffer cells, KC). We have demonstrated that the KC exhibits marked intrinsic resistance to infection in vitro with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Liver and peritoneal MO (PMO) were harvested from untreated mice (naive), from mice treated with drug vehicle, or from mice treated with either a synthetic nonspecific immunomodulator, maleic anhydride divinyl ether copolymer (MVE-2), or with MO colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1). The studies revealed that resident KC, isolated by two different methods, are equally as nonpermissive for infection with HSV-1 as are resident PMO. When infected with HSV-1, resident KC showed no cytopathic effect, and no infectious virus was produced. Intravenous (i.v.) treatment of mice with MVE-2 (50 mg/kg 3 days before cell harvest) increased the number of KC recovered. However, neither i.v. treatment with MVE-2 nor CSF-1 (20,000 U daily for 4 days) had any pronounced effect on the permissiveness of KC or PMO to infection with HSV-1. These data support a role for KC in host antiviral resistance, and indicate that KC intrinsic antiviral resistance is maintained during immunotherapy with MVE-2 or CSF-1.

"Bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against the two envelope glycoproteins (G 1 and G 2) of the Puumala (PUU) virus were generated and characterized. Analyses of the MAbs' antigen and epitope specificities showed non-overlapping reactivities of one anti-G 1 and two anti-G 2 MAbs. A significant neutralizing activity was shown by the anti-G 1 and one of the anti-G 2 MAbs, suggesting the existence of at least one neutralizing domain on each of the two glycoproteins. The two neutralizing MAbs reacted with eight PUU-related (serotype 3) virus strains, but did not react with Hantaan, Seoul, or Prospect Hill viruses in an immunofluorescence assay, indicating reactivity with epitopes unique for PUU virus. The non-neutralizing anti-G 2 MAb also reacted with Seoul virus, revealing the presence of a conserved G 2-epitope common for PUU and Seoul viruses, not involved in neutralization. Competitive binding of the MAbs and sera from nephropathia epidemica patients indicated that the defined neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes of the glycoproteins were immunodominant also in humans. In another experiment, magnetic beads coated with two MAbs were bound with the virus glycoproteins and used for selective enrichment of cells secreting anti-glycoprotein antibodies.

"Pim-1 is a putative oncogene activated in T-cell lymphomas induced by Moloney and AKR mink cell focus forming (MCF) viruses. We have determined the chromosomal localization of the Pim-1 gene in mice by Southern blot analysis of DNAs obtained from a panel of mouse-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. The Pim-1 gene was localized on chromosome 17, a chromosome frequently aberrant in T-cell lymphomas. Two chromosomal regions, containing sequences homologous to regions within the Pim-1 locus, were localized on chromosome 6 and 16.

"The column studies presented in this paper simulated the infiltrative surface of onsite wastewater systems where effluent is applied and where a biomat may form. Two bacteriophages, MS-2 and PRD-1, were used as surrogates for human pathogenic enteric viruses during two tracer tests. A vacuum manifold was used to simulate the drainage effects of an underlying unsaturated soil profile, allowing for the collection of percolate samples at 4 cm immediately below the infiltrative surface. The impact of effluent applied (septic tank effluent (STE) or a simulated ground water), soil type (medium sand or sandy loam), hydraulic loading rate (5 or 25 cm/day) and method of application (four equivalent daily doses or 24 equivalent micro-doses per day) on the removal of viruses were investigated. These unsaturated mini column experiments demonstrated that the removal of viruses within an infiltrative surface zone (of approximately 4 cm) generally improved over time under the conditions studied. An exception occurred in sand-filled columns dosed with STE where the removal of PRD-1 decreased after a period of effluent application. Statistical analysis conducted on the calculated percent removal demonstrated that the quality of the effluent applied to the infiltrative surface is important for removal of MS-2 and PRD-1. Hydraulic loading rate also proved important in the removal of viruses. At the time of tracer test 2, columns dosed at the higher HLR (25 cm/day) had higher percent removals for both MS-2 and PRD-1. Soil type altered the removal of PRD-1 at the time of the second tracer test, at which time sandy loam had higher removal rates for PRD-1. No significant differences were observed between columns dosed four times daily and those dosed 24 times daily for either bacteriophage at either of the tracer test time points. These data suggest that over a relatively short period of operation the infiltrative surface of soil based wastewater treatment systems can achieve much higher removal then initially measured shortly after startup.

"NS5A derived from a hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b isolate has previously been shown to undergo phosphorylation on serine residues (T. Kaneko, Y. Tanji, S. Satoh, M. Hijikata, S. Asabe, K. Kimura, and K. Shimotohno, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 205:320-326, 1994). In this report, phosphorylation of NS5A derived from HCV isolates of the 1a and distantly related 2a genotypes is demonstrated. Phosphoamino acid analysis of NS5A from the 1a isolate indicated that phosphorylation occurs predominantly on serine, with a minor fraction of threonine residues also being phosphorylated. NS5A phosphorylation was observed in diverse cell types, including COS-1, BHK-21, HeLa, and the hepatoma cell line HuH-7. Phosphorylation of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)/HCV-H NS5A fusion protein was also demonstrated in an in vitro kinase assay. This activity seemed to be highest when the pH of the reaction was neutral or slightly alkaline and displayed a preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+, with an optimum concentration of approximately 10 mM Mn2+. Somewhat surprisingly, in vitro phosphorylation of NS5A was inhibited by the addition of > or = 0.25 mM Ca2+ to reaction buffer containing Mn2+ and/or Mg2+. Comparison of phosphopeptide maps of NS5A phosphorylated in vitro and in cultured cells showed that most of the phosphopeptides comigrated, suggesting that one or more kinases involved in NS5A phosphorylation in vivo and in vitro are the same. The effects of various kinase inhibitors on NS5A phosphorylation were consistent with a kinase activity belonging to the CMGC group of serine-threonine kinases. The development of an in vitro kinase assay for NS5A phosphorylation should facilitate identification of kinase(s) responsible for its phosphorylation and of phosphorylation sites which may influence the function of NS5A in HCV propagation.

"Ljungan virus (LV) (family Picornaviridae, genus Parechovirus) is a suspected zoonotic pathogen with associations to human disease in Sweden. LV is a single-stranded RNA virus with a positive sense genome. There are five published Ljungan virus strains, three isolated from Sweden and two from America, and are classified into four genotypes. A further two strains described here were isolated from wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) caught in Västmanlands county, Sweden in 1994. These strains were sequenced using next generation pyrosequencing technology on the GS454flx platform. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of the obtained genomes confirms isolates LV340 and LV342 as two new putative members of genotype 2 along with LV145SL, with 92% and 99% nucleotide identities respectively. Only two codon sites throughout the entire genome were identified as undergoing positive selection, both situated within the VP3 structural region, in or near to major antigenic sites. Whilst these two strains do not constitute new genotypes they provide evidence, though weakly supported, which suggests the evolution of Ljungan viruses to be relatively slow, a characteristic unlike other picornaviruses. Additional genomic sequences are urgently required for Ljungan virus strains, particularly from different locations or hosts, to fully understand the evolutionary and epidemiological properties of this potentially zoonotic virus.

"Human retrovirus 5 (HRV-5) represented a fragment of a novel retrovirus sequence identified in human RNA and DNA preparations. In this study, the genome of HRV-5 was cloned and sequenced and integration sites were analyzed. Using PCR and Southern hybridization, we showed that HRV-5 is not integrated into human DNA. A survey of other species revealed that HRV-5 is present in the genomic DNA of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and belongs to an endogenous retrovirus family found in rabbits. The presence of rabbit sequences flanking HRV-5 proviruses in human DNA extracts suggested that rabbit DNA was present in our human extracts, and this was confirmed by PCR analysis that revealed the presence of rabbit mitochondrial DNA sequences in four of five human DNA preparations tested. The origin of the rabbit DNA and HRV-5 in human DNA preparations remains unclear, but laboratory contamination cannot explain the preferential detection of HRV-5 in inflammatory diseases and lymphomas reported previously. This is the first description of a retrovirus genome in rabbits, and sequence analysis shows that it is related to but distinct from A-type retroelements of mice and other rodents. The species distribution of HRV-5 is restricted to rabbits; other species, including other members of the order Lagomorpha, do not contain this sequence. Analysis of HRV-5 expression by Northern hybridization and reverse transcriptase PCR indicates that the virus is transcribed at a low level in many rabbit tissues. In light of these findings we propose that the sequence previously designated HRV-5 should now be denoted RERV-H (for rabbit endogenous retrovirus H).

"Cultivation of Pneumocystis carinii from rabbit onto cell monolayers was intended. Three cell types were used: rat lung derived cell line L2 and canine kidney derived cell line MDCK, and primary epithelial rabbit lung cells derived from 20 days old foetuses. These primary cells were also immortalized by transfection of the coding sequences for the large and small T antigens of the SV40 virus. P. carinii were extracted from lungs of corticoid treated young rabbits and were purified on Ficoll. In vitro development of P. carinii was assessed by counting the number of attached parasites on cells after staining. No development was observed on L2 nd MDCK cell lines. On the contrary, a development was observed on rabbit derived cells with a threefold increase of attached parasites on the third day of culture. Immortalized cells allowed also multiplication of attached P. carinii. These results are similar to those obtained with culture of rodent P. carinii onto cell monolayers.

"Swine have been used in biomedical research for many years, but have generally been limited to those locations with personnel familiar with this species and with specially designed facilities and equipment. There is currently a growing trend in the United States for more swine, both miniature and domestic to be used as research models. Commercial availability, education through workshops and symposia, and specific research applicability in the areas such as: organ transplantation, cardiovascular surgery, nutrition, diabetes, dermatology, and renal physiology have all contributed to the increased usage of swine. Additionally, increasing costs and public concern about the use of random source dogs and cats have also resulted in a refocus on swine as a laboratory animal model. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) has recently gained a role as a laboratory animal model when it was discovered that woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) is closely related to hepatitis B virus in humans (HBV). Chronic infections in woodchucks with WHV have shown protein particles in their blood which are similar to the Australian antigen found on the surface of HBV. There is also immunologic response similarities by the respective host to these viruses. These findings have resulted in a number of laboratories using the woodchuck in infectious disease comparative research studies. A euthymic hairless guinea pig has been described in Canada and recently been produced on a limited basis commercially in the United States. For dermatologic studies requiring an immunocompetent animal model the hairless guinea pig may prove useful. time to have the ability to add

"Several of the cleavages required to generate the mature nonstructural proteins from the flaviviral polyprotein are known to be mediated by a complex consisting of NS2B and a serine proteinase domain located in the N-terminal one-third of NS3. These cleavages typically occur after two basic residues followed by a short side chain residue. Cleavage at a similar dibasic site in the structural region is believed to produce the C terminus of the virion capsid protein. To study this cleavage, we developed a cell-free trans cleavage assay for yellow fever virus (YF)-specific proteolytic activity by using a substrate spanning the C protein dibasic site. Cleavage at the predicted site was observed when the substrate was incubated with detergent-solubilized lysates from YF-infected BHK cells. NS2B and the NS3 proteinase domain were the only YF-specific proteins required for this cleavage. Cell fractionation studies demonstrated that the YF-specific proteolytic activity was membrane associated and that activity could be detected only after detergent solubilization. Previous cell-free studies led to a hypothesis that processing in the C-prM region involves (i) translation of C followed by translocation and core glycosylation of prM by using an internal signal sequence, (ii) signalase cleavage to produce a membrane-anchored form of the C protein (anchC) and the N terminus of prM, and (iii) NS2B-3-mediated cleavage at the anchC dibasic site to produce the C terminus of the virion C protein. However, the results of in vivo transient-expression studies do not support this temporal cleavage order. Rather, expression of a YF polyprotein extending from C through the N-terminal one-third of NS3 revealed that C-prM processing, but not translocation, was dependent on an active NS2B-3 proteinase. This suggests that signalase-mediated cleavage in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum may be dependent on prior cleavage at the anchC dibasic site. Possible pathways for processing in the C-prM region are outlined and discussed.

"Homologs to genes residing on human chromosome 3 (HSA 3) map to four mouse chromosomes (MMU) 3, 6, 9, and 16. In the bovine, two syntenic groups that contain HSA 3 homologs, unassigned syntenic groups 10 (U10) and 12 (U12), have been defined. U10 also contains HSA 21 genes, which is similar to the situation seen on MMU 16, whereas U12 apparently contains only HSA 3 homologs. The syntenic arrangement of other HSA 3 homologs in the bovine was investigated by physically mapping five genes through segregation analysis of a bovine-hamster hybrid somatic cell panel. The genes mapped include Friend-murine leukemia virus integration site 3 homolog (FIM3; HSA 3/MMU 3), sucrase-isomaltase (SI) and glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1) (HSA 3/MMU ?), murine leukemia viral (v-raf-1) oncogene homolog 1 (RAF1; HSA 3/MMU 6), and ceruloplasmin (CP; HSA 3/MMU 9). FIM3, SI, and CP mapped to bovine syntenic group U10, while RAF1 and GPX1 mapped to U12.

"A critical step for liver-directed gene therapy is the selective targeting of nucleic acids to hepatocytes. We have previously discovered that the proximal half of the T7 phage tail fiber protein (p17) targeted intact T7 phage and recombinant proteins to hepatocytes in vivo. In the present study, we have localized the targeting activities to a 33 amino acid sequence within the p17 coiled-coil rod domain. Given that the tail fiber domain from which the peptide was derived may form alpha and triple helical structures, biophysical studies (CD spectra and analytical ultracentrifugation) were conducted to determine the secondary and tertiary structures of the peptide. This peptide is able to target proteins, polymers, and siRNA and also particles such as DNA polyplexes and liposomes to hepatocytes. A variety of coupling strategies and chemistries were employed, thus demonstrating that this peptide is a versatile system for delivering cargo. The ability of this hepatocyte-targeting peptide to target DNA-containing particles suggests that it should be useful in the development of both nonviral and viral vectors. However, biological function of delivered cargo has not been demonstrated. This was primarily due to failure of delivered cargo to escape the endosomes. Further studies are in progress to provide functional activity of delivered nucleic acids by enabling their endosomal escape.

"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In heroin dependent individuals, the HIV epidemic has been controlled in countries where access to opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) and needle exchange programs (NEP) have been implemented. However, despite similar routes of contamination for both viruses, the prevalence of hepatitis C (HCV) infection remains high in drug users. The objective of this analysis was to identify the prevalence of HCV and the correlates of being HCV-positive in a sample of out-of-treatment heroin-dependent individuals. METHODS: Data were collected from five inpatient studies (n = 120 participants) conducted at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. A logistic regression was used to identify correlates of being HCV-positive at baseline. RESULTS: Among the 120 heroin-dependent volunteers, 42 were HCV-positive. Participants who had heavier alcohol use, a longer duration of heroin use, or who reported using heroin by injection were more likely to be HCV-positive. Interestingly, participants who had injected cocaine during the previous month had a ninefold greater risk of being HCV-positive compared to non-cocaine users and those who used cocaine by a non-injecting route. CONCLUSIONS AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: These findings confirm the risk of being HCV-infected through intravenous drug use, especially with cocaine use. These results underscore the importance of rethinking interventions to prevent HCV infection with combined strategies using pharmacological approaches for cocaine dependence and tailored prevention for cocaine users.

"Alphavirus genome replication is a multistep asymmetric process. Several lines of evidence suggest that the template preference of the RNA replicase is regulated by proteolytic cleavage of the viral nonstructural polyprotein. Cis-acting RNA elements in the viral genome also play crucial roles in regulating genome replication and subgenomic RNA transcription. In this report, a series of RNA templates were analyzed in vitro and in vivo to define functional elements in the 5' end of the genome. The 5' UTR was shown to contain distinct core promoter elements for both minus- and plus-strand synthesis. In addition, two conserved stem-loop structures within the nsP1 coding sequence enhanced RNA replication but were not required. Studies with chimeric templates and trans-competition experiments suggest that the 5' determinant for minus-strand initiation can differ among alphaviruses and binds to one or more limiting replicase components. The results provide compelling evidence that the 5' and 3' ends of alphavirus genome RNAs must interact to initiate replication and we propose one model for how this interaction might occur. In addition to providing new insight into the initiation of alphavirus genome replication, these results have implications for the development of improved alphavirus vector systems with reduced recombination potential.

"Viruses in the genus Hantavirus can cause one of two serious illnesses when transmitted from rodents to humans: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) or hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). Of the two diseases, HPS is more severe with an approximate 40% mortality across the Americas. The high rate of mortality could be reduced if effective therapeutics could be discovered for treatment of this illness. Herein we review approaches being explored for the discovery of therapeutics for HPS and how they could be employed in treatment and prevention of disease.

"Significantly more occlusion bodies (OB) of DuPont viral construct HzSNPV-LqhIT2, expressing a scorpion toxin, were transported by artificial rainfall to cotton plants from sandy soil (70:15:15 sand-silt-clay) than from silt (15:70:15) and significantly more from silt than from clay (15:15:70). The amounts transported by 5 versus 50 mm of precipitation were the same, and transport was zero when there was no precipitation. In treatments that included precipitation, the mean number of viable OB transported to entire, 25- to 35-cm-tall cotton plants ranged from 56 (clay soil, 5 mm of rain) to 226 (sandy soil, 50 mm of rain) OB/plant. In a second experiment, viral transport increased with increasing wind velocity (0, 16, and 31 km/h) and was greater in dry (-1.0 bar of matric potential) than in moist (-0.5 bar) soil. Wind transport was greater for virus in a clay soil than in silt or sand. Only 3.3 x 10(-7) (clay soil, 5 mm rain) to 1.3 x 10(-6) (sandy soil, 50 mm rain) of the OB in surrounding soil in experiment 1 or 1.1 x 10(-7) (-0.5 bar sandy soil, 16-km/h wind) to 1.3 x 10(-6) (-1.0 bar clay soil, 31-km/h wind) in experiment 2 were transported by rainfall or wind to cotton plants. This reduces the risk of environmental release of a recombinant nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV), because only a very small proportion of recombinant virus in the soil reservoir is transported to vegetation, where it can be ingested by and replicate in new host insects.

"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of proteins involved in transmembrane signal transduction and are actively studied because of their suitability as therapeutic small-molecule drug targets. Agonist activation of GPCRs almost invariably results in the receptor being desensitized. One of the key events in receptor desensitization is the sequestration of the receptor from the cell surface into acidic intracellular endosomes. Therefore, a convenient, generic, and noninvasive monitor of this process is desirable. A novel, pH-sensitive, red-excited fluorescent dye, CypHer 5, was synthesized. This dye is non-fluorescent at neutral pH and is fluorescent at acidic pH. Anti-epitope antibodies labeled with this dye were internalized in an agonist concentration- and time-dependent manner, following binding on live cells to a range of GPCRs that had been modified to incorporate the epitope tags in their extracellular N-terminal domain. This resulted in a large signal increase over background. When protonated, the red fluorescence of CypHer 5 provides a generic reagent suitable for monitoring the internalization of GPCRs into acidic vesicles. This approach should be amenable to the study of many other classes of cell surface receptors that also internalize following stimulation.

"Natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with the renal syndrome (HFRS) have been found for the first time in the Komi ASSR. The main source of the causative agent in this territory was Clethrionomys glareolus the average infection rate of which was 4.4% and in some areas as high as 22.6%. For the first time in the republic the portion of human population naturally immune to HFRS was determined, comprising 5.2% of the population. The immune structure of the population did not differ from that in other focal territories of the European part of the USSR.

"There are genetically determined differences in susceptibility to arthritis among inbred rat strains. The aim of the present study was to elucidate phenotypical differences, by determining expression of TNF and IL-1beta, two pivotal mediators of arthritis, in the highly arthritis-prone Dark Agouti (DA) rat compared to that of two arthritis-resistant rat strains, the major histocompatibility complex-homologous Piebald-Viral-Glaxo (PVG.1AV1) rat and the Brown Norway (BN) rat, assessed by immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate a distinct difference in articular cartilage, with chondrocytes expressing IL-1beta, not TNF, in the highly arthritis-prone DA rat as opposed to the two arthritis-resistant BN or PVG.1AV1 rat strains, where no cytokine expression was documented. The results were otherwise congruent among the rat strains. We observed TNF- and IL-1beta-expressing cells within the synovial lining layer in all rat strains. Other tissues studied, auricular cartilage as well as muscle, lung, thyroid gland and kidney tissue, were devoid of cytokine expression. Constitutional expression of IL-1beta in chondrocytes might facilitate initiation and perpetuation of inflammation. This may offer one explanation of why erosive arthritides are so easily induced in the DA rat and also support the hypothesis that articular chondrocytes may themselves play a major role in cartilage matrix degradation.

"The European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a staple prey species in Mediterranean ecosystems. The arrival and subsequent spread of rabbit hemorrhagic disease throughout southwestern Europe, however has caused a decline in rabbit numbers, leading to considerable efforts to enhance wild rabbit populations, especially through habitat management. Because rabbit population dynamics depend on habitat suitability and changes in habitat structure and composition subsequent to habitat management, I evaluated the effects of population dynamics on the long-term impact of rabbit hemorrhagic disease on rabbit populations. I used an age-structured model with varying degrees of population productivity and turnover and different habitat carrying capacities, and I assumed the existence of a unique, highly pathogenic virus. My results suggest that disease impact may be highly dependent on habitat carrying capacity and rabbit population dynamics, and the model provided some insight into the current abundance of wild rabbits in different locations in southwestern Europe. The highest disease impact was estimated for populations located in habitats with low to medium carrying capacity In contrast, disease impact was lower in high-density populations in habitats with high carrying capacity, corresponding to a lower mean age of rabbit infection and a resulting lower mortality from rabbit hemorrhagic disease. The outcomes of the model suggest that management strategies to help rabbit populations recover should be based on improving habitats to their maximum carrying capacity and increasing rabbit population productivity. In contrast, the use of strategies based on temporary increases in rabbit density, including vaccination campaigns, translocations, and temporal habitat improvements at medium carrying capacities, may increase disease impact, resulting in short-term decreases in rabbit population density.

"A spatially well organized continuum of proliferation, differentiation, and death is displayed along crypt-villus units in the adult mouse small intestine. This continuum provides an opportunity to examine in vivo the mechanisms by which proliferative status changes as a function of cellular differentiation. Immunohistochemical studies of normal FVB/N mice revealed that as epithelial cells complete their terminal differentiation during a 48-72-h migration up villi, there is a marked and rapid fall in the levels of two important regulators of the G1/S transition, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2. However, cellular levels of their partners, cdk4 and cyclin E, remain unchanged as does the level of pRB. Adult FVB/N transgenic mice were studied that contained an intestinal fatty acid binding protein gene promoter (Fabpi) linked to wild type Simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 TAgWt) or a mutant TAg with Lys for Glu substitutions at residues 107 and 108 (SV40 TAgK107/8) that fails to bind pRB and related pocket proteins. Both transgenes are expressed only in villus enterocytes. SV40 TAgWt causes these terminally differentiated cells to re-enter the cycle. Re-entry is accompanied by a reduction in un/hypophosphorylated pRB, an induction of cyclin D1 and cdk2, but no change in cdk4, cyclin E, or E2F-1. In contrast, SV40 TAgK107/8 fails to induce re-entry and does not produce changes in un/hypophosphorylated pRB, cyclin D1, or cdk2 accumulation. These results suggest that un/hypophosphorylated pRB is an important mediator of the cell cycle arrest that normally occurs as enterocytes exit the crypt and complete their differentiation. Fabpi-directed expression of E2F-1 does not cause villus enterocytes to return to the cell cycle, alter their suppression of cyclin D1 or cdk2, or affect their state of differentiation, emphasizing the insensitivity of these cells to the effects of E2F-1. Analyses of p53(-/-) and p53(+/+) mice containing Fabpi-SV40 TAgWt and Fabpi-SV40 TAgK107/8 established that the proliferation induced by SV40 TAgWt does not require p53 and is associated with increased (p53-independent) apoptosis. The presence of cyclin E and cdk4 in differentiating villus enterocytes emphasizes that these cells retain part of their proliferative heritage expressed 24-72 h earlier in the crypt. The data suggest that down-regulation of cdk2 and/or cyclin D1 expression may be important for control of proliferative status and/or execution of terminal differentiation.

"Progesterone regulates multiple behavioral, physiological, and pathological aspects of female reproductive biology through its two progesterone receptors (PRs), PR-B and the truncated PR-A. PR-B is necessary for mammary gland development in mice and, compared with PR-A, is overall a stronger transactivator of target genes due to an additional activation function 3 (AF3) domain. In dogs, known for their high sensitivity to progesterone-induced mammary cancer, the PR-B function was studied. Canine PR (cPR)-B appeared to contain multiple mutations within AF3 core sequence motifs and lacks N-terminal ligand-independent posttranslational modifications. Consequently, cPR-B has a weak transactivation potential on progesterone-responsive mouse mammary tumor virus-luc and progesterone response element 2-luc reporters transiently transfected in hamster, human, or canine cells and also on known target genes FKBP5 and SGK in doxycycline-inducible, stable transfected cPR-B in canine mammary cells. The cPR-B function was restored to the level of human PR-B by the replacement of canine AF3 domain with the human one. The lack of AF3 domain-dependent transcriptional activity was unique for canids (gray wolf, red fox, and raccoon dog) and not present in closely related caniform species (brown bear, gray seal, and domestic ferret). Despite the limited transactivation potential, canids develop normal mammary glands and frequently mammary tumors. Therefore, these results question the role of PR-B in breast cancer development and may explain unique features of canid reproduction.

"The aromatic amines 2-aminofluorene (2AF), 2-acetylaminofluorene, and 2-aminoanthracene, and the heterocyclic amines 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,4-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, and 3-amino-1-methyl-SH-pyrido[4,3-b]indole (Trp-P-2) were activated by rat liver cytosolic fractions to form mutagenic metabolites in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA98NR, and TA98/1,8-DNP6. In the case of the Trp-P-2, the cytosolic activation was even more potent than the microsomal activation, which is classically ascribed to N-hydroxylation and subsequent esterification. The cytosolic activation was a) NADPH-dependent, b) induced by pretreatment of rats with 3-methylcholanthrene and especially Aroclor 1254 but not by phenobarbital, and c) inhibited by dicoumarol. The hypothesis is that, following a preliminary oxidative step in the cytosol (pure cytosolic activation) or in microsomes via prostaglandin H synthase (mixed microsomal-cytosolic activation), an oxidized intermediate of amino compounds may serve as substrate for DT diaphorase activity and bielectronically reduced to the corresponding N-hydroxyamino derivative. Purified DT diaphorase, in the presence of either NADPH or NADH as electron donor, produced mutagenic derivatives from IQ and Trp-P-2. An NADPH-dependent activation of Trp-P-2 also occurred in the liver cytosol of woodchucks (Marmota monax), but was not inhibited by dicoumarol. As previously demonstrated with liver S-12 fractions in both humans and woodchucks, the cytosolic activation of Trp-P-2 was enhanced in animals affected by hepatitis B virus infection. This enhanced metabolism, which persisted even after appearance of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in virus carriers, is likely to be ascribed to mechanisms other than DT diaphorase induction, such as glutathione depletion.

"The utility of adenovirus (Ad) vectors for gene transduction can be limited by receptor specificity. We developed a gene-delivery vehicle in which the potent Ad5 vector was genetically reengineered to display the mucosal-targeting sigma1 protein of reovirus type 3 Dearing (T3D). A sigma1 construct containing all but a small virion-anchoring domain was fused to the N-terminal 44 aa of Ad5 fiber. This chimeric attachment protein Fibtail-T3Dsigma1 forms trimers and assembles onto Ad virions. Fibtail-T3Dsigma1 was recombined into the Ad5 genome, replacing sequences encoding wild-type fiber. The resulting vector, Ad5-T3Dsigma1, expresses Fibtail-T3Dsigma1 and infects Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human or mouse homologs of the reovirus receptor, junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1), but not the coxsackievirus and Ad receptor. Treatment of Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells with either JAM1-specific antibody or neuraminidase reduced transduction by Ad5-T3Dsigma1, and their combined effect decreased transduction by 95%. Ad5-T3Dsigma1 transduces primary cultures of human dendritic cells substantially more efficiently than does Ad5, and this transduction depends on expression of JAM1. These data provide strong evidence that Ad5-T3Dsigma1 can be redirected to cells expressing JAM1 and sialic acid for application as a vaccine vector.

"The cytosolic helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) initiates immune responses to most RNA viruses by detecting viral 5'-triphosphorylated RNA (pppRNA). Although endogenous mRNA is also 5'-triphosphorylated, backbone modifications and the 5'-ppp-linked methylguanosine ((m7)G) cap prevent immunorecognition. Here we show that the methylation status of endogenous capped mRNA at the 5'-terminal nucleotide (N1) was crucial to prevent RIG-I activation. Moreover, we identified a single conserved amino acid (H830) in the RIG-I RNA binding pocket as the mediator of steric exclusion of N1-2'O-methylated RNA. H830A alteration (RIG-I(H830A)) restored binding of N1-2'O-methylated pppRNA. Consequently, endogenous mRNA activated the RIG-I(H830A) mutant but not wild-type RIG-I. Similarly, knockdown of the endogenous N1-2'O-methyltransferase led to considerable RIG-I stimulation in the absence of exogenous stimuli. Studies involving yellow-fever-virus-encoded 2'O-methyltransferase and RIG-I(H830A) revealed that viruses exploit this mechanism to escape RIG-I. Our data reveal a new role for cap N1-2'O-methylation in RIG-I tolerance of self-RNA.

"OBJECTIVES: To analyse a measles outbreak in a Roma community. METHODS: We describe a community-wide outbreak of genotype D8 measles that took place in southeastern France, between May and July 2017, along with the control measures adopted. RESULTS: We identified a total of eighteen cases, between six months and 24 years old. All cases were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated and belonged to a sedentary French Roma community. Most of them (67%) were hospitalised, with three cases (17%) of severe measles including one death of a 16-year-old girl who had previously received oral corticosteroids. The latter was the only lethal case notified in France during the year 2017. Control measures included intensification of surveillance, isolation of cases, and a large vaccination campaign in this Roma community. During the outbreak period, there was no case of healthcare-associated measles transmission. A broad adherence to vaccination through the mediating role of both the chief of the community and the pastor allowed reaching completed vaccination coverage of 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts should be concentrated to enhance access to health services for minorities such as the Roma community characterized by low vaccination coverage. A trustful relationship with leaders of the community is essential to ensure adherence to vaccination. In France, attributable mortality to measles is low and concerns mainly unvaccinated and immunodepressed patients.

"Multicistronic vectors can increase transgene expression and decrease the imbalance of gene expression in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell expression system. Small, self-cleaving 2A peptides have a high cleavage efficiency and are essential for constructing high-expression multicistronic vectors. In this study, we investigated the effects of two different 2A peptides on transgene expression in CHO cells via their mediating action on tricistronic vectors. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) and red fluorescent protein (RFP) genes were linked by the porcine teschovirus-1 (P2A) and Thosea asigna virus (T2A) peptides in a multicistronic vector. We transfected CHO cells with these vectors and screened for the presence of blasticidin-resistant colonies. Flow cytometry and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) were used to detect the expression levels of eGFP and RFP and the copy numbers of stably transfected cells. The results showed that P2A could enhance eGFP and RFP expression by 1.48- and 1.47-fold, respectively, compared to T2A. The expression levels of the genes were not proportional to their copy numbers. In conclusion, we found that P2A can effectively drive transgene expression in CHO cells and a potent 2A peptide can be used for recombinant protein production in the CHO cell system.

"Introduction: The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is the largest extant carnivorous marsupial. Since 1996, its population has declined by 77% primarily due to a clonal transmissible tumor, known as devil facial tumor (DFT1) disease. In 2014, a second transmissible devil facial tumor (DFT2) was discovered. DFT1 and DFT2 are nearly 100% fatal.Areas covered: We review DFT control approaches and propose a rabies-style oral bait vaccine (OBV) platform for DFTs. This approach has an extensive safety record and was a primary tool in large-scale rabies virus elimination from wild carnivores across diverse landscapes. Like rabies virus, DFTs are transmitted by oral contact, so immunizing the oral cavity and stimulating resident memory cells could be advantageous. Additionally, exposing infected devils that already have tumors to OBVs could serve as an oncolytic virus immunotherapy. The primary challenges may be identifying appropriate DFT-specific antigens and optimization of field delivery methods.Expert opinion: DFT2 is currently found on a peninsula in southern Tasmania, so an OBV that could eliminate DFT2 should be the priority for this vaccine approach. Translation of an OBV approach to control DFTs will be challenging, but the approach is feasible for combatting ongoing and future disease threats.

"Disruption of melanocortin (MC) signaling, such as by ectopic Agouti overexpression, leads to an obesity syndrome with hyperphagia, obesity, and accelerated body weight gain during high-fat diet. To investigate where in the brain disruption of MC signaling results in obesity, long-term Agouti expression was induced after local injections of recombinant adeno-associated viral particles in selected brain nuclei of adult rats. Agouti expression in the paraventricular nucleus, a hypothalamic region with a high density of MC receptors, induced acute onset hyperphagia and rapid weight gain that persisted for at least 6 weeks. In contrast, obesity and hyperphagia developed with a 3 week delay when Agouti was expressed in the dorsal medial hypothalamus. Agouti expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) did not affect food intake and body weight during regular diet, despite the presence of MC receptors in this region. However, during exposure to a high-fat diet, animals with Agouti expression in the LH exhibited a marked increase in body weight. Here we show that the LH is important for the protection against diet-induced obesity by controlling caloric intake during consumption of a high-fat diet. Together, this study provides evidence that different aspects of the Agouti-induced obesity syndrome, such as hyperphagia and diet responsiveness, are mediated by distinct brain regions and opens challenging opportunities for further understanding of pathophysiological processes in the development of the obesity syndrome.

"BACKGROUND: The impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related characteristics such as genotype, viral load or liver fibrosis on the chances of achieving sustained HIV suppression in coinfected patients is not fully documented. METHOD: We examined the relationship between both HIV/HCV-related and sociobehavioural characteristics and HIV sustained viral suppression (SVS) in 897 patients included in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort. RESULTS: The main outcome variable was HIV SVS, defined as at least two consecutive undetectable HIV viral loads. Among the 897 HIV/HCV-coinfected patients, 419 (47%) had received HCV therapy at least once, and 103 patients (25%) had experienced an HCV sustained virologic response (SVR). In multivariate analysis, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.23 for each period of 5 years of age, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.49; P = 0.03], a higher level of school education (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.04-3.56; P = 0.04), good adherence to HIV therapy (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.23-3.43; P = 0.006) and HCV SVR (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.01-3.26; P = 0.04) remained significantly associated with HIV SVS. In contrast, triple nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) regimens were associated with failure to achieve HIV SVS (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.27-0.94; P = 0.03). Our results show that HCV SVR is associated with a higher likelihood of achieving HIV SVS. CONCLUSION: With the advent of direct-acting anti-HCV drugs, a marked increase in the rate of virologic response is observed in coinfected patients. So, further research is needed to determine whether suppression of HCV replication could be associated with a higher efficacy of antiretroviral therapy.

"The presence of air-water interface in batch sorption experiments may result in inaccurate estimation of virus adsorption onto various soils. A batch sorption experiment was conducted to compare the adsorption results of MS2 in different soils under presence/absence of air-water interface. Soils with sterilization/nonterilization treatment were used. Virus recovery efficiency in a blank experiment (no soil) was also evaluated as affected by different amount of air-water interface. The presence of air-water interface altered the results of virus adsorption in different soils with different extent, with Sandy fluvo-aquic soil being the most considerably affected, followed by Red loam soil, and the least being Red clay soil, probably because of different soil properties associated with virus adsorption/inactivation. Soil sterilization resulted in more significant difference of virus adsorption onto the Sandy fluvo-aquic soil between the presence and absence of air-water interface, while a reduced difference was observed in the Red loam soil. The presence of air-water interface significantly decreased virus recovery efficiency, with the values being decreased with increase in the amount of air-water interface. Soil particles likely prohibit viruses from reaching the air-water interface or alter the forces at the solid-water-air interface so that the results from the blank experiment did not truly represent results from control blank, which probably resulted in adsorption difference between presence and absence of the air-water interface.

"Murine polyomavirus (Py) infection initiates by the recognition of cell membrane molecules containing terminal sialic acid (SA) residues through specific binding pockets formed at the major capsid protein VP1 surface. VP1 Pockets 1, 2, and 3 bind terminal SA, Gal, and second branched SA, respectively. The consequence of recognition on viral cell entry remains elusive. In this work, we show that preincubation of Py with soluble compounds within Pocket 1 (N-acetyl or N-glycolyl neuraminic acids) increases Py cell binding and infectivity in murine 3T6 fibroblasts. In contrast, Gal does not significantly alter Py binding nor infectivity, whereas sialyllactose, in Pockets 1 and 2, decreases cell binding and infectivity. Binding experiments with Py virus-like particles confirmed the direct involvement of VP1 in this effect. To determine whether such results could reflect VP1 conformational changes induced by SA binding, protease digestion assays were performed after pretreatment of Py or virus-like particles with soluble receptor fragments. Binding of SA with the VP1 Pocket 1, but not of compounds interacting with Pocket 2, was associated with a transition of this protein from a protease-sensitive to a protease-resistant state. This effect was transmitted to the minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 in virus particles. Attachment of Py to cell monolayers similarly led to a VP1 trypsin-resistant pattern. Taken together, these data present evidence that initial binding of Py to terminal SA induces conformational changes in the viral capsid, which may influence subsequent virus cell entry steps.

"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is an important cytokine with pleiotropic regulatory functions in the immune system and in the responses against viral infections. TGF-β acts on a variety of immune cells through the cell surface TGF-β receptor (University of Duisburg-EssenTGFBR). The woodchuck has been used as a biomedical model for studies of obesity and energy balance, endocrine and metabolic function, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and neoplastic disease. Woodchucks infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) represent an informative animal model to study hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this study, the cDNA sequences of woodchuck TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 were cloned, sequenced and characterized. The full-length TGFBR1 cDNA sequence consisted of 1305bp coding sequence (CDS) that encoded 434 amino acids with a molecular weight of 48.9kDa. The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that the woodchuck TGF-β family genes had a closer genetic relationship with Ictidomys tridecemlineatus. One antibody with cross-reactivity to woodchuck TGFBR1 was identified by flow cytometry. Moreover, the expression of these genes were analyzed at the transcriptional level. The quantitative PCR analysis showed that the TGF-β family transcripts were constitutively expressed in many tissues tested. Altered expression levels of the TGF-β family transcripts in the liver of WHV infected woodchucks were observed. These results serve as a foundation for further insight into the role of the TGF-β family in viral hepatitis in woodchuck model. Our work also possesses the potential value for characterizing the TGF-β family in other related diseases, such as obesity-related diseases, metabolic disorder, cardiovascular disease and cancer.

"An influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and an influenza B virus were passaged in 3-fluoro(eq)-4-guanidino difluoro sialic acid (3Feq4Gu DFSA), an inhibitor of the influenza neuraminidase (NA) to determine whether resistant variants could be selected. 3Feq4Gu DFSA is a mechanism-based inhibitor, forming a covalent link to Y406 in the NA active site. Given its similarity to the natural substrate, sialic acid, we predicted resistant variants would be difficult to select. Yields of both viruses decreased with passaging, so that after 12 passages both viruses were only growing to low titers. Drug concentrations were decreased for another three passages. There was no difference in NA sensitivity in the MUNANA fluorescence-based assay, nor in plaque assays for the passaged virus stocks. All influenza B plaques were still wild type in all assays. There were isolated small diffuse plaques in the P15 pdm09 stock, which after purification had barely detectable NA or hemagglutinin (HA) activity. These had a novel non-active site I106M substitution in the NA gene, but unexpectedly no HA changes. The I106M may impact NA function through steric effects on the movement of the 150 and 430-loops. The I106M viruses had similar replication kinetics in MDCK cells as wild type viruses, but their ability to bind to and infect CHO-K1 cells expressing high levels of cell-bound mucin was compromised. The I106M substitution was unstable, with progeny rapidly reverting to wild type by three different mechanisms. Some had reverted to I106, some had V106, both with wild type NA and HA properties. A third group retained the I106M, but had a compensating R363K substitution, which regained almost wild type NA properties. These viruses now agglutinated chicken red blood cells (CRBCs) but unlike the I/V106, they rebound after elution at 37 °C. There were no mutations in the HA, but each phenotype correlated with the NA sequence. We propose that the activity in the I106M mutant is insufficient to remove carbohydrates from the virion HA and NA, sterically limiting HA access to CRBC receptors, thus resulting in poor HA binding.

"The duration and fitness dependence of memory in viral quasispecies evolving in cell culture have been investigated using two genetic markers of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). In lineages of antigenic variant FMDV RED, which reverted to FMDV RGD, memory FMDV RED genomes were detected after 50 infectious cycles, and memory level was fitness dependent. In growth-competition experiments between a reference FMDV RGD and two different FMDV RED populations, a 7.6-fold higher fitness of the initial FMDV RED population resulted in 30 to 100-fold higher memory level. In lineages of low-fitness clones containing an elongated internal polyadenylate tract, revertants lacking excess adenylate residues became dominant by passage 20. However, genomes including a larger number of adenylate residues were detected as memory genomes after at least 150 infectious cycles. Thus, quasispecies memory can be durable and is fitness dependent, as predicted from the growth competition of two mutant forms of a genome. An understanding of factors influencing quasispecies memory levels and duration may have implications for the extended diagnosis of viruses based on the quantification of minority genomes.

"Since the identification of the first case of Hantavirus infection in Chile in 1995, a great advance in the knowledge of the disease natural history has occurred. There is evidence to suppose that the infection by Andes virus in suburban areas of Argentina and Chile, whose natural reservoir is Oligoryzomys longicaudatus, has been present but unidentified for a long time. We describe a serologically proven case occurred in 1975. The clinical presentation of the disease slightly differs from that described for Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), caused by Sin Nombre virus in the USA. There is a wider range of presentation forms including, besides HPS, mild and asymptomatic cases, a greater proportion of renal involvement and pediatric cases. Therefore the epidemiological scenario would be an endemic disease with fluctuations that follow changes in rodent population and their interactions with humans.

"The influence of transcription on homologous intrachromosomal recombination between direct and inverted repeats has been examined by using Chinese hamster ovary cells. Recombination was monitored between two integrated neomycin (neo) genes, including one silent allele and a second allele regulated by the inducible mouse mammary tumor virus promoter. Transcription of mouse mammary tumor virus neo alleles was regulated with the glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone. Alleles transcribed at high levels recombined about two- to sevenfold more frequently than identical alleles transcribed at low levels. Direct repeats recombined primarily by a gene conversion mechanism; inverted repeats produced a variety of rearranged products. These results are discussed in relation to recombinational processes that regulate gene expression, influence gene family structures, and mediate genomic instability associated with cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.

"Isolation of a gene based on its location, which depends on aligning physical landmarks with the genetic map, can yield basic information about genome structure and organization. As a first step toward isolating the mouse agouti (A) locus, we have begun to define the physical position of this gene relative to genetically linked DNA probes from the Psp, Emv-15, and Src loci. Using a combination of pulsed-field gel techniques that include partial digestion with rare-cutting restriction enzymes and analysis of polymorphic sites present in certain inbred strains, we have constructed long-range restriction maps for each of the probes that span a total of more than 3000 kb. The Src and Emv-15 probes are less than 600 kb apart, but are separated from the Psp probe by at least 1500 kb. By determining the position of a 75-kb deletion that inactivates agouti function, we have localized the A locus to within 500 kb of the Psp probe, but more than 600 kb away from the Emv-15 probe. These physical distances contrast with the known recombination frequencies, 3 +/- 3 cM for A-Psp and less than 0.3 cM for A-Emv-15, and suggest that recombination between A and Emv-15 may be suppressed.

"The ability of hamster SV40 tumor cells to concentrate Neutral Red into localized intracytoplasmic vacuoles and granules has been correlated with the ability of those cells to adhere and to replicate in tissue culture. Cells damaged by complement-fixing anti-tumor antibody and metabolic inhibitors first undergo delocalization of the dye, which appears as a diffuse stain throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm. More severely damaged cells lose the stain entirely, at a stage of progressive cell damage correlated with Trypan Blue uptake. A rapid and sensitive cytotoxic assay procedure has been based upon Neutral Red staining behavior, and the assay has been used to study antibody-dependent, complement-mediated cytotoxic anti-SV40 tumor activity in the sera of normal hamsters.

"Murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) causes tumors of various origins in newborn mice and hamsters. Infection is initiated by attachment of the virus to ganglioside receptors at the cell surface. Single amino acid exchanges in the receptor-binding pocket of the major capsid protein VP1 are known to drastically alter tumorigenicity and spread in closely related MuPyV strains. The virus represents a rare example of differential receptor recognition directly influencing viral pathogenicity, although the factors underlying these differences remain unclear. We performed structural and functional analyses of three MuPyV strains with strikingly different pathogenicities: the low-tumorigenicity strain RA, the high-pathogenicity strain PTA, and the rapidly growing, lethal laboratory isolate strain LID. Using ganglioside deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts, we show that addition of specific gangliosides restores infectability for all strains, and we uncover a complex relationship between virus attachment and infection. We identify a new infectious ganglioside receptor that carries an additional linear [α-2,8]-linked sialic acid. Crystal structures of all three strains complexed with representative oligosaccharides from the three main pathways of ganglioside biosynthesis provide the molecular basis of receptor recognition. All strains bind to a range of sialylated glycans featuring the central [α-2,3]-linked sialic acid present in the established receptors GD1a and GT1b, but the presence of additional sialic acids modulates binding. An extra [α-2,8]-linked sialic acid engages a protein pocket that is conserved among the three strains, while another, [α-2,6]-linked branching sialic acid lies near the strain-defining amino acids but can be accommodated by all strains. By comparing electron density of the oligosaccharides within the binding pockets at various concentrations, we show that the [α-2,8]-linked sialic acid increases the strength of binding. Moreover, the amino acid exchanges have subtle effects on their affinity for the validated receptor GD1a. Our results indicate that both receptor specificity and affinity influence MuPyV pathogenesis.

"BACKGROUND: General practitioners' (GPs) recommendations to their patients regarding influenza vaccination is a key determinant of patient uptake of influenza vaccination. OBJECTIVES: To study factors associated with GPs' recommendations regarding pandemic vaccination (pvaccination) to adults ≤65 years of age (hereafter referred to as adults) at risk and not at risk of severe complications of the 2009-2010 A/H1N1 influenza. PATIENTS/METHODS: National cross-sectional survey of 1431 French GPs. Pvaccination recommendations by GPs to adults were studied according to three categories: recommended pvaccination to at-risk adults only; recommended pvaccination to all adults; recommended against pvaccination or did not provide any advice to any adult. RESULTS: GPs were more likely to recommend pvaccination to at-risk than not-at-risk adults (73.4% vs 40.1%, p<0.01). GPs who consulted official sources of information rather than news media during the pandemic were more likely to recommend pvaccination to at-risk adults only (OR=1.78; CI 95%=1.27-2.48) and to all adults (OR=2.03; CI 95%=1.42-2.92) than other GPs. GPs' unfavorable perceptions of the risk/efficacy balance of the pandemic vaccine (pvaccine) together with their perceptions of the low severity of the disease were negatively associated with recommending pvaccination. Hospitalization of GPs' patients because of the influenza was specifically associated with pvaccine recommendation to all adults (OR=2.81; CI 95%=1.98-3.99) but not with pvaccine recommendation to at-risk adults only. CONCLUSION: In the pandemic context, GPs' perceptions of disease severity and the risk/efficacy balance of the pvaccine were the major determinants of French GPs recommending pvaccination or not. To increase the general public's acceptability of vaccination policies, GPs should be adequately informed about the course of the epidemics and the safety of the vaccine.

"Transfection is a powerful non-viral technology used to deliver foreign nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells, and is the method of choice for a variety of applications including studying the functional role of particular genes and the proteins they code for. By over-expressing genes to produce protein of interest and also by knocking down specific genes, researchers are able to accurately define the role of genes and the protein they encode in various cellular processes. Therefore, this powerful technology is a very vital component of the array of scientific research tools. However, the exact mechanism of action of transfection and also the numerous factors that influence the success of DNA or RNA delivery processes are not clearly understood. Hence, this chapter attempts to explain some of the popular cationic lipid/polymer-based transfection reagents for in vitro DNA/small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) delivery, mainly focusing on the protocols and critical factors to keep in mind to ensure successful delivery of nucleic acids into eukaryotic cells using these methods.

"OBJECTIVES: Cardiac vascular endothelial growth factor-B transgene limits myocardial damage in rat infarction models. We investigated whether heart transplant vascular endothelial growth factor-B overexpression protected against ischemia-reperfusion injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We transplanted hearts heterotopically from Dark Agouti to Wistar Furth rats. To characterize the role of vascular endothelial growth factor-B in ischemia-reperfusion injury, we transplanted either long-term human vascular endothelial growth factor-B transgene overexpressing hearts from Wistar Furth rats or short-term adeno-associated virus 9-human vascular endothelial growth factor-B-transduced hearts from Dark Agouti rats into Wistar Furth rats. Heart transplants were subjected to 2 hours of cold and 1 hour of warm ex vivo ischemia. Samples were collected 6 hours after reperfusion. RESULTS: Two hours of cold and 1 hour of warm ischemia increased vascular endothelial growth factor-B mRNA levels 2-fold before transplant and 6 hours after reperfusion. Transgenic vascular endothelial growth factor-B overexpression caused mild cardiac hypertrophy and elevated cardiac troponin T levels 6 hours after reperfusion. Laser Doppler measurements indicated impaired epicardial tissue perfusion in these transgenic transplants. Recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor-B increased mRNA levels of cytochrome c oxidase and extracellular ATPase CD39, suggesting active oxidative phosphorylation and high ATP production. Adeno-associated virus 9-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor-B overexpression in transplanted hearts increased intragraft macrophages 1.5-fold and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 12 p35 mRNA 1.6-fold, without affecting recipient serum cardiac troponin T concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Vascular endothelial growth factor-B expression in transplanted hearts is linked to ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Cardiac transgenic vascular endothelial growth factor-B overexpression failed to protect heart transplants from ischemia-reperfusion injury.

"The aim of the current study was to calculate the size of protection zones around (sub)oxic and anoxic sandy aquifers without confining layers using a virus infection and transport model. The maximum allowable virus infection risk was 10(-4)/person/year at the 95% confidence level. Model results demonstrated that phreatic (sub)oxic sandy aquifers in The Netherlands required protection areas with a residence time of 43-117 d to ensure that the maximum virus infection risk would not be exceeded. This was 0.7-2 x the current guideline of 60d. In contrast, phreatic anoxic sandy aquifers without confining layers needed protection zones of 555-898d to stay below the maximum virus infection risk, 9.5-15 x the current guideline. A sensitivity analysis of the model demonstrated that the calculated protection zone was most sensitive for virus inactivation rate and collision efficiency. Values of both parameters were predicted from values obtained from previously published field and laboratory studies. At present, as it is unknown if these values can also be used at other locations, model results should be interpreted with care.

"We have successfully limited the level of hepatitis delta viraemia occurring after superinfection of hepadna-virus infected woodchucks by prior immunisation with the short form of the hepatitis delta virus antigen expressed by a recombinant baculovirus or vaccinia virus. This phenomenon occurred in the absence of detectable circulating antibody to hepatitis delta virus antigen and in the absence of evidence of priming of the humoral immune response and may reflect the induction of a cytotoxic T-cell response. The latter would control viraemia by rapid lysis of delta antigen expressing hepatocytes. It is suggested that the T-cell epitopes involved may be located on the carboxyl end of the delta protein (amino acids 77-195).

"The adsorption of viruses in untreated flushed dairy manure wastewater (FDMW), anaerobically digested flushed dairy manure wastewater (ADFDMW) and groundwater to sandy soil was investigated. Batch adsorption studies showed differential adsorption of viruses in groundwater to soil. Less than 75% of PRD1 and MS2 added to groundwater adsorbed after 1 h, but greater than 95% of phiX174 and poliovirus 1 adsorbed to the soil. Adsorption differences in groundwater were related to the isoelectric points of the viruses. Suspending phages in untreated and treated wastewater reduced adsorption compared with groundwater. For MS2, more phages were adsorbed using ADFDMW than with FDMW. Adsorption of poliovirus 1 was not affected by FDMW and ADFDMW. Small column studies (6 x 2.5 cm) produced a similar trend in that adsorption was observed with groundwater and both FDMW and ADFDMW reduced virus adsorption. Groundwater, FDMW or ADFDMW did not affect the adsorption of poliovirus 1 in column studies. The major difference between FDMW and ADFDMW was in mobilisation of adsorbed viruses. The application of FDMW to soil columns with adsorbed viruses caused significantly more viruses to be mobilised than did the application of rainwater or ADFDMW. These results showed that treating FDMW by anaerobic digestion increased the adsorption of viruses to soil and decreased detachment of adsorbed viruses. As the potential for new zoonotic pathogens becomes known, the treatment of animal wastes may become mandatory. The assessment and management of viruses in manure for addressing possible risk to animal and human health is of interest.

"The ecology of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus transmission was compared at three enzootic foci: two forest sites in the Catatumbo region of western Venezuela that have yielded small numbers of virus isolates since the 1970s, and another focus in the middle Magdalena Valley of Colombia that has consistently yielded many VEE virus isolates. Our results demonstrated dramatic differences in VEE virus isolation rates from sentinel hamsters, as well as differences in mosquito species composition and captured mammals with antibodies to VEE virus, between the Colombian and Venezuelan study sites. The higher isolation rate of enzootic VEE virus in the Colombian site was associated with a more abundant fauna of spiny rats (Proechimys spp.), known reservoir hosts of enzootic VEE virus. Mosquito collections demonstrated that the Colombian forest had a higher mosquito diversity and species evenness than either of the Venezuelan forests. The Colombian focus was especially richer in its Culex (Melanoconion) spp. fauna, a subgenus that includes all proven enzootic vectors for VEE virus. Our results suggest that the greater abundance, diversity, and stability of enzootic vector populations, combined with the greater density of rodent reservoir hosts, explains the higher levels of VEE virus circulation in the Colombian focus compared with the Venezuelan forests.

"The European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus is a keystone species from the Iberian Peninsula where viral diseases have played a prominent role in regulating their populations. Coccidiosis, a parasitic disease caused primarily by Eimeria spp., is also thought to have important negative effects. However, few studies have investigated the impact of coccidia on wild European rabbit populations on the Iberian Peninsula. Here we estimate coccidian prevalence in rabbit faecal samples collected along transects established in two ecological regions. Six Eimeria species, with different pathogenicity, were identified (E. coecicola, E. perforans, E media, E. magna, E. irresidua and E. flavescens). Species diversity varied significantly between regions although mean oocyst excretion levels were generally low in both areas (57.61 s.d.±78.07 and 17.03 s.d.±27.72, oocyst per gram of rabbit faeces). This study is the first to describe the composition of the Eimeria spp. assemblage for wild rabbit populations on the Iberian Peninsula and provides fundamental information for future studies on the potential interaction of viral and parasitic diseases.

"We have examined the dose-dependent effects and central action of intraventricular administration of a recombinant adeno-associated virus encoding rat leptin (rAAV-leptin) in suppressing body weight (BW) gain in adult female rats. A low dose of rAAV-leptin (5x10(10) particles) suppressed weight gain (15%) without changing daily food intake (FI), but a twofold higher dose decreased BW by 30% along with a reduction in daily FI. Reduced BW was due to a loss in body adiposity because serum leptin was reduced. Serum insulin levels were decreased (96%) by only the high dose along with a slight reduction in glucose. Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT), reflecting energy expenditure through thermogenesis, was upregulated to the same magnitude by the two rAAV-leptin doses. We analyzed by in situ hybridization the expression in the hypothalamus of genes encoding the appetite-regulating neuropeptides. Only the high dose decreased expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY), the orexigenic peptide, and increased proopiomelanocortin (POMC), precursor of the an orexigenic peptide, alpha-MSH. Our studies show for the first time that increased availability of leptin within the hypothalamus through central leptin gene therapy dose-dependently decreases weight gain, adiposity, and serum insulin by increasing energy expenditure and decreasing FI. The decrease in FI occurs only when NPY is reduced and alpha-MSH is increased in the hypothalamus by the high dose of rAAV-leptin. Delivery of the leptin gene centrally through rAAV vectors is a viable therapeutic modality for long-term control of weight and metabolic hormones.

"Myxoma virus causes the systemic disease myxomatosis in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Originating in the South American rabbit Sylvilagus brasiliensis, where it causes a relatively localized fibroma, myxoma virus is a classic example of a virus that has jumped species to produce an exotic disease and then coevolved with its new host. Like other poxviruses, myxoma virus encodes multiple proteins capable of downregulating the host innate and acquired immune responses. Other virus-encoded proteins enable replication in host lymphocytes and monocytes, for example, by inhibiting apoptosis. Detailed studies on these proteins have demonstrated novel methods of interactions with the host immune system and added substantially to the understanding of the interaction of large DNA viruses with their hosts. Despite the increasingly detailed molecular knowledge of myxoma virus, relatively little is known about the dynamics of the interaction of the virus with the integrated host-immune system during infection and, in particular, about the evolution of resistance to the virus in wild rabbits or the species barrier. This review will focus on the detailed molecular studies that have been done with myxoma virus and discuss the more limited knowledge of the pathogenesis of myxoma virus in rabbits and the ways that the consolidated immune responses may determine genetic resistance to myxomatosis.

"A non-tissue-specific enhancer derived from the promoter of the rat 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78)-coding gene was tested for its ability to stimulate the activity of its homologous promoter and two heterologous promoters (simian virus 40 and mouse mammary tumor virus). Single and double copies of the enhancer were inserted at positions 5' and 3' of the cat-expression vectors under the direction of the above promoters. The recombinant plasmids were transfected into hamster fibroblast K12 cells and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity under induced and non-induced conditions. We report that the GRP78 enhancer (i) exhibits strong cooperative interactions with its homologous promoter; (ii) can activate and confer a calcium ionophore (A23187) inducibility to heterologous promoters in an orientation-independent manner; (iii) prefers the 5' over the 3' location and; (iv) is dosage dependent in that two copies are twice as active as a single unit.

"IMPORTANCE: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are life-threatening when metastatic or not amenable to surgical removal. In a few patients with advanced GISTs refractory to imatinib mesylate, treatment with sunitinib malate followed by regorafenib provides tumor control; however, additional active treatments are needed for most patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), tumor objective response, and overall survival rates in patients with GISTs treated with dasatinib. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-arm clinical trial used a Bayesian design to enroll patients 13 years or older with measurable imatinib-refractory metastatic GISTs treated at 14 sarcoma referral centers from June 1, 2008, through December 31, 2009. A control group was not included. Patients were followed up for survival for a minimum of 5 years from date of enrollment. Tumor imaging using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was performed every 8 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. Tumor response was assessed by local site using the Choi criteria. Treatment was continued until tumor progression, unacceptable toxic effects after reduction in drug dose, or patient or physician decision. Archival tumor tissue was evaluated for expression of the proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (SRC), phosphorylated SRC (pSRC), and succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B (SDHB) proteins and for mutation in the V-Kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) genes. Data analysis was performed from May 19, 2017, through December 20, 2017. INTERVENTIONS: Dasatinib, 70 mg orally twice daily. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was the 6-month PFS estimate using greater than 30% as evidence of an active drug and less than 10% as evidence of inactive treatment. RESULTS: In this study, 50 patients were enrolled (median age, 60 years; age range, 19-78 years; 31 [62%] male and 19 [38%] female; 41 [82%] white), and 48 were evaluable for response. The estimated 6-month PFS rate was 29% in the overall population and 50% in a subset of 14 patients with pSRC in GISTs. Objective tumor response was observed in 25%, including 1 patient with an imatinib-resistant mutation in PDGFRA exon 18. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Dasatinib may have activity in a subset of patients with imatinib-resistant GISTs. Further study is needed to determine whether pSRC is a prognostic biomarker.

"The Chinese hamster ovary adenine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (aprt) was reengineered to be flanked by sequences from the thymidine kinase (tk) gene of herpes simplex virus. This construct was cotransfected with DNA from herpes simplex virus type 1, and after 3 days, virus was harvested and Tk- plaques were selected after the virus was plated on Tk- cells in the presence of bromodeoxycytosine. Recombinant viruses were identified by dot-blot hybridization, and the arrangement of aprt and tk sequences were determined by Southern blot hybridization. Analysis of the recombinants revealed that acquisition of aprt sequences resulted from insertional inactivation of the tk locus as a consequence of homology-based recombination. Recombination was precise, as evidenced by the failure to detect plasmid sequences or the synthetic restriction endonuclease sites that bounded the mutant tk gene in the aprt-tk construct. Infection of Aprt- mouse or Chinese hamster ovary cells with UV-irradiated virus and selection in medium containing azaserine and adenine resulted in the survival of numerous colonies that stably express the aprt gene. Transformed cells synthesized an aprt mRNA that is identical to wild-type mRNA as determined by Northern blot and S1 nuclease analyses. Cells lytically infected with the recombinant virus do not appear to transcribe the aprt gene. Thus, infected cells differentiate between virus and foreign promoters even when a cellular gene is cis to the virus chromosome.

"Hantaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses each carried by a specific rodent species. Three hantaviruses, Puumala, Dobrava, and Saaremaa viruses, are known to cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. In Europe. Puumala causes a generally mild disease, nephropathia epidemica, which presents most commonly with fever, headache, gastrointestinal symptoms, impaired renal function, and blurred vision, whereas Dobrava infections often also have haemorrhagic complications. There are few available data about the clinical picture of confirmed Saaremaa infections, but epidemiological evidence suggests that it is less pathogenic than Dobrava, and that Saaremaa infections are more similar to nephropathia epidemica caused by Puumala. Along with its rodent host, the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), Puumala is reported throughout most of Europe (excluding the Mediterranean region), whereas Dobrava, carried by the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis), and Saaremaa, carried by the striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), are reported mainly in eastern and central Europe. The diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection is based on the detection of virus-specific IgM. Whereas Puumala is distinct, Dobrava and Saaremaa are genetically and antigenically very closely related and were previously thought to be variants of the same virus. Typing of a specific hantavirus infection requires neutralisation antibody assays or reverse transcriptase PCR and sequencing.

"The genome of Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) consists of sequences derived from both BALB/c mouse deoxyribonucleic acid and the genome of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Using deoxyribonucleic acid linear intermediates as a source of retroviral deoxyribonucleic acid, we isolated a recombinant plasmid which contained 1.9 kilobases of the 3.5-kilobase mouse-derived sequences found in A-MuLV (A-MuLV-specific sequences). We used this clone, designated pSA-17, as a probe restriction enzyme and Southern blot analyses to examine the arrangement of homologous sequences in BALB/c deoxyribonucleic acid (endogenous Abelson sequences). The endogenous Abelson sequences within the mouse genome were interrupted by noncoding regions, suggesting that a rearrangement of the cell sequences was required to produce the sequence found in the virus. Endogenous Abelson sequences were arranged similarly in mice that were susceptible to A-MuLV tumors and in mice that were resistant to A-MuLV tumors. An examination of three BALB/c plasmacytomas and a BALB/c early B-cell tumor likewise revealed no alteration in the arrangement of the endogenous Abelson sequences. Homology to pSA-17 was also observed in deoxyribonucleic acids prepared from rat, hamster, chicken, and human cells. An isolate of A-MuLV which encoded a 160,000-dalton transforming protein (P160) contained 700 more base pairs of mouse sequences than the standard A-MuLV isolate, which encoded a 120,000-dalton transforming protein (P120).

"The Long Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat, which has been established as a strain showing hereditary hepatitis and hepatic carcinoma, was found to possess autoimmune antibodies to liver microsomal proteins, particularly to a protein with the molecular weight of 56kD. The antibodies also recognized a protein(s) in liver microsomes from Long Evans Agouti and Sprague-Dawley rats. About 42 and 15 percent of respective female and male LEC rats died within a week after acute hepatitis; sera from all of the animals contained the antibodies. About 43 and 0 percent of the surviving female and male LEC rats possessed the antibodies, respectively. These results suggest that the autoantibodies occur in association with acute lethal hepatitis in the LEC rats.

"We have developed a new expression vector which allows efficient selection for transfectants that express foreign genes at high levels. The vector is composed of a ubiquitously strong promoter based on the beta-actin promoter, a 69% subregion of the bovine papilloma virus genome, and a mutant neomycin phosphotransferase II-encoding gene driven by a weak promoter, which confers only marginal resistance to G418. Thus, high concentrations of G418 (approx. 800 micrograms/ml) effectively select for transfectants containing a high vector copy number (greater than 300). We tested this system by producing human interleukin-2 (IL-2) in L cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and the results showed that high concentrations of G418 efficiently yielded L cell and CHO cell transfectants stably producing IL-2 at levels comparable with those previously attained using gene amplification. The vector sequences were found to have integrated into the host chromosome, and were stably maintained in the transfectants for several months.

"The outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the Republic of Bashkortostan, resulting in 10,057 registered cases of the disease (287 cases per 100,000 of the population), was analyzed. HFRS cases among the population were registered in 52 out of 54 regions of Bashkortostan. 31% of the total number of patients were the inhabitants of rural regions (170 cases per 100,000) and 69% were urban dwellers (295 cases per 100,000), mainly in Ufa (512 cases per 100,000). HFRS morbidity among males was fourfold higher than among females. In 70% of cases persons aged 20-49 years were affected. 5% of the total number of patients were children aged up to 14 years. In 34 cases (0.4%) the severe clinical course of the disease had a fatal outcome. Cases of HFRS were registered from April 1997 till March 1998 with the highest morbidity rate observed during the period of August-December. In most cases (46.8%) both urban and rural dwellers contacted infection during a short-term stay in the forest. As the result of the serological examination of the patients, all HFRS cases were etiologically attributed to hantavirus, serotype Puumala. The main natural reservoir of this virus and the source of human infection in Bashkortostan were bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), the domination species among small mammals in this region.

"The six coxsackievirus B serotypes (CVB1-6) use the coxsackie- and adenovirus receptor (CAR) for host cell entry. Four of these serotypes, CVB1, 3, 5 and 6, have also shown the capacity to replicate and cause cytolysis in rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, a CAR-deficient cell line. This extended tropism has been associated with an acquired ability to bind decay accelerating factor (DAF). In this study, we have adapted the CVB2 prototype strain Ohio-1 (CVB2/O) to replicate in RD cells. Two types of infection were identified: (I) an enterovirus-typical, lytic infection, and (II) a non-lytic infection. Both CVB2/O-RD variants retained the prototype-ability to cause cytopathic effect in HeLa cells using CAR as receptor. Phenotypic and genotypic changes in the CVB2/O-RD-variants were determined and compared to the prototype cultured in HeLa cells. Inhibition studies using antibodies against CAR and DAF revealed a maintained ability of the CVB2/O-RD-variants to bind CAR, but no binding to DAF was observed. In addition, neither the prototype nor the CVB2/O-RD-variants were able to cause hemagglutination in human red blood cells, an enterovirus feature associated with affinity for DAF. Sequence analysis of the CVB2/O-RD-variants showed acquired mutations in the capsid region, suggesting extended receptor usage towards an alternative, yet unidentified, receptor for CVB2.

"CONTEXT: Despite huge advances in the fight against HIV concerning diagnosis, clinical efficacy of antiretroviral treatments (ART), patient survival and quality of life, there is still no cure. Recent developments in HIV cure research have opened the way for clinical trials which could lead to a temporary or definitive end to ART. However, ethical questions exist about related trial-participation risks. The main goal of the ANRS-APSEC survey was, using Q-methodology, to investigate the viewpoints of people living with HIV (PLWH) and HIV healthcare providers (HHP) regarding motivations for and barriers to participation in HIV Cure-related clinical trials (HCRCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three statements were defined encompassing seven dimensions: treatment and follow-up; risks; benefits; patient-physician relationship; beliefs and attitudes; information; target population. Forty-one PLWH and 41 HHP from five French HIV services were asked to rank-order the statements. RESULTS: Five main viewpoints were elicited from ""the most motivated"" to ""the most reluctant"" vis-à-vis HCRCT participation. All placed importance on the wish to participate in HIV research. This result is in line with the HIV-specific culture of joint mobilization. For some viewpoints, the motivation to participate in/propose HCRCT was primarily conditioned by side-effects and/or by constraints, which overall were more accepted by PLWH than HHP. Some viewpoints placed particular importance on HCRCT recruitment strategies. Finally, some expressed a high acceptance of risks and constraints but emphasized the need for information. CONCLUSION: HIV cure research clinical trials (HCRCT) constitute a risky yet unavoidable step towards the goal of finding a cure. To improve future HCRCT and informed consent designs, based on PLWH and HHP preferences and expectations, we need greater knowledge about how these populations perceive the risks and the benefits of HCRCT. Our results confirmed the importance of careful, studied HCRCT design, management and communication, to ensure PLWH and HHP acceptability and convergence of their expectations.

"While genetic modification of adenoviral vectors can produce vectors with modified tropism, incorporation of targeting peptides/proteins into the structural context of the virion can also result in destruction of ligand targeting or virion integrity. To combat this problem, we have developed a versatile targeting system using metabolically biotinylated adenoviral vectors bearing biotinylated fiber proteins. These vectors have been demonstrated to be useful as a platform for avidin-based ligand screening and vector targeting by conjugating biotinylated ligands to the virus using high-affinity tetrameric avidin (K(d) = 10(-15) M). The biotinylated vector could also be purified by biotin-reversible binding on monomeric avidin (K(d) = 10(-7) M). In this report, a second metabolically biotinylated adenovirus vector, Ad-IX-BAP, has been engineered by fusing a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) to the C-terminus of the adenovirus pIX protein. This biotinylated vector displays twice as many biotins and was markedly superior for single-step affinity purification on monomeric avidin resin. However, unlike the fiber-biotinylated vector, Ad-IX-BAP failed to retarget to cells with biotinylated antibodies including anti-CD71 against the transferrin receptor. In contrast, Ad-IX-BAP was retargeted if transferrin, the cognate ligand for CD71, was used as a ligand rather than the anti-CD71. This work demonstrates the utility of metabolic biotinylation as a molecular screening tool to assess the utility of different viral capsid proteins for ligand display and the biology and compatibility of different ligands and receptors for vector targeting applications. These results also demonstrate the utility of the pIX-biotinylated vector as a platform for gentle single-step affinity purification of adenoviral vectors.

"Temperature of culture can be used to modulate cellular metabolism for improving small intestinal cell culture and cryopreservation. An hypothermia pretreatment (2 days at 25 degrees C and 3 hours recovery at 37 degrees C) improved hamster cell survival to freeze-thaw damage (p < 0.01) but decreased the survival of 2 immortal pig ileal cell lines even though epithelioid IPI-2I cells were more tolerant to hypothermia than IPI-1 fibroblasts. Epithelioid cells survived 3 days at 25 degrees C with unaltered expression of cytokeratin-18 whereas colonies of fibroblasts did not survive more than a day at 25 degrees C (p < 0.001). These results suggest that hypothermia-tolerance of pig ileal cell lines might differ according to cell lineage calling for further experiments on small intestinal primary cell culture.

"BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induces angiogenesis and osteogenesis in bone allotransplants. We aim to determine whether bone remodeling in VEGF-treated bone allotransplants results from repopulation with circulation-derived autogenous cells or survival of allogenic transplant-derived cells. METHODS: Vascularized femoral bone transplants were transplanted from female Dark Agouti rats (DA;RT1(a) ) to male Piebald Viral Glaxo (PVG;RT1(c) ). Arteriovenous bundle implantation and short-term immunosuppression were used to maintain cellular viability. VEGF was encapsulated in biodegradable microspheres and delivered intramedullary in the experimental group (n = 22). In the control group (n = 22), no VEGF was delivered. Rats were sacrificed at 4 or 18 weeks. Laser capture microdissection of bone remodeling areas was performed at the inner and outer cortex. Sex-mismatched genes were quantified with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to determine the amount of male cells to total cells, defined as the relative expression ratio (rER). RESULTS: At 4 weeks, rER was significantly higher at the inner cortex in VEGF-treated transplants as compared to untreated transplants (0.622 ± 0.225 vs. 0.362 ± 0.081, P = 0.043). At 4 weeks, the outer cortex in the control group had a significantly higher rER (P = 0.038), whereas in the VEGF group, the inner cortex had a higher rER (P = 0.015). Over time, in the outer cortex the rER significantly increased to 0.634 ± 0.106 at 18 weeks in VEGF-treated rats (P = 0.049). At 18 weeks, the rER was >0.5 at all cortical areas in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These in vivo findings suggest a chemotactic effect of intramedullary applied VEGF on recipient-derived bone and could imply that more rapid angiogenesis of vascularized allotransplants can be established with microencapsulated VEGF.

"The capsid protein (CA) of HIV-1 plays essential roles in multiple steps of the viral replication cycle by assembling into functional capsid core, controlling the kinetics of uncoating and nuclear entry, and interacting with various host factors. Targeting CA represents an attractive yet underexplored antiviral approach. Of all known CA-targeting small molecule chemotypes, the peptidomimetic PF74 is particularly interesting because it binds to the same pocket used by a few important host factors, resulting in highly desirable antiviral phenotypes. However, further development of PF74 entails understanding its pharmacophore and mitigating its poor metabolic stability. We report herein the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a large number of PF74 analogs aiming to provide a comprehensive chemical profiling of PF74 and advance the understanding on its detailed binding mechanism and pharmacophore. The analogs, containing structural variations mainly in the aniline domain and/or the indole domain, were assayed for their effect on stability of CA hexamers, antiviral activity, and cytotoxicity. Selected analogs were also tested for metabolic stability in liver microsomes, alone or in the presence of a CYP3A inhibitor. Collectively, our studies identified important pharmacophore elements and revealed additional binding features of PF74, which could aid in future design of improved ligands to better probe the molecular basis of CA-host factor interactions, design strategies to disrupt them, and ultimately identify viable CA-targeting antiviral leads.

"The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is one of the most devastating invasive species in Australia. Since the 1950s, myxoma virus (MYXV) and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) have been used to manage overabundant rabbit populations. Resistance to MYXV was observed within a few years of the release. More recently, resistance to lethal RHDV infection has also been reported, undermining the efficiency of landscape-scale rabbit control. Previous studies suggest that genetic resistance to lethal RHDV infection may differ locally between populations, yet the mechanisms of genetic resistance remain poorly understood. Here, we used genotyping by sequencing (GBS) data representing a reduced representation of the genome, to investigate Australian rabbit populations. Our aims were to understand the relationship between populations and identify possible genomic signatures of selection for RHDV resistance. One population we investigated had previously been reported to show levels of resistance to lethal RHDV infection. This population was compared to three other populations with lower or no previously reported RHDV resistance. We identified a set of novel candidate genes that could be involved in host-pathogen interactions such as virus binding and infection processes. These genes did not overlap with previous studies on RHDV resistance carried out in different rabbit populations, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are feasible. These findings provide useful insights into the different potential mechanisms of genetic resistance to RHDV virus which will inform future functional studies in this area.

"We have previously reported that actin filaments are involved in protein transport from the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum. Herein, we examined whether myosin motors or actin comets mediate this transport. To address this issue we have used, on one hand, a combination of specific inhibitors such as 2,3-butanedione monoxime (BDM) and 1-[5-isoquinoline sulfonyl]-2-methyl piperazine (ML7), which inhibit myosin and the phosphorylation of myosin II by the myosin light chain kinase, respectively; and a mutant of the nonmuscle myosin II regulatory light chain, which cannot be phosphorylated (MRLC2(AA)). On the other hand, actin comet tails were induced by the overexpression of phosphatidylinositol phosphate 5-kinase. Cells treated with BDM/ML7 or those that express the MRLC2(AA) mutant revealed a significant reduction in the brefeldin A (BFA)-induced fusion of Golgi enzymes with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This delay was not caused by an alteration in the formation of the BFA-induced tubules from the Golgi complex. In addition, the Shiga toxin fragment B transport from the Golgi complex to the ER was also altered. This impairment in the retrograde protein transport was not due to depletion of intracellular calcium stores or to the activation of Rho kinase. Neither the reassembly of the Golgi complex after BFA removal nor VSV-G transport from ER to the Golgi was altered in cells treated with BDM/ML7 or expressing MRLC2(AA). Finally, transport carriers containing Shiga toxin did not move into the cytosol at the tips of comet tails of polymerizing actin. Collectively, the results indicate that 1) myosin motors move to transport carriers from the Golgi complex to the ER along actin filaments; 2) nonmuscle myosin II mediates in this process; and 3) actin comets are not involved in retrograde transport.

"The modular concept of cerebellar connections has been advocated in the lifetime work of Jan Voogd. In this concept, a cerebellar module is defined as the conglomerate of one or multiple and non-adjacent, parasagittally arranged zones of Purkinje cells, their specific projection to a well-defined region of the cerebellar nuclei, and the climbing fiber input to these zones by a well-defined region of the inferior olivary complex. The modular organization of these olivo-cortico-nuclear connections is further exemplified by matching reciprocal connections between inferior olive and cerebellar nuclei. Because the different regions of the cerebellar nuclei show highly specific output patterns, cerebellar modules have been suggested to constitute functional entities. This idea is strengthened by the observation that anatomically defined modules adhere to the distribution of chemical markers in the cerebellar cortex suggesting that modules not only differ in their input and output relations but also may differ in operational capabilities. Here, I will briefly review some recent data on the establishment of cerebellar modules in rats. Furthermore, some evidence will be shown suggesting that the other main afferent system (i.e., mossy fibers), at least to some extent, also adheres to the modular organization. Finally, using retrograde transneuronal tracing with rabies virus, some evidence will be provided that several cerebellar modules may be involved in the control of individual muscles.

"PURPOSE: We decided to construct a novel oncolytic adenovirus whose replication was driven by the CDC25B promoter for its use in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We placed the essential E1A gene under control of the CDC25B promoter. Based on preliminary data, we pseudotyped the adenovirus with a chimeric fiber of serotypes 5/3. We investigated the in vitro lytic effect and the in vivo therapeutic efficacy in combination with gemcitabine on human pancreatic tumor xenografts orthotopically growing in nude mice and in tumors growing in Syrian hamsters. We also assessed biochemical markers of hepatic toxicity and CA19.9 levels. RESULTS: AV25CDC exhibited a strong in vitro lytic effect on pancreatic cancer cells. In vivo administration of AV25CDC combined with gemcitabine in mice harboring subcutaneously growing SW1990 pancreatic tumors almost abrogated tumor growth. Nude mice harboring 15-day-old orthotopic tumors, treated intratumorally or systemically with AV25CDC combined with gemcitabine, exhibited 70% to 80% reduction in tumor size compared with control mice that lasted for at least 60 days. Chemovirotherapy treatment induced a return to normal levels of biochemical parameters of hepatic toxicity; these mice exhibited more than 90% reduction in CA19.9 serum levels compared with control. Chemovirotherapy efficacy was confirmed in mice harboring Mia PaCa-2 tumors and in Syrian hamster harboring HaP-T1 tumors. We observed that viral treatment disrupted tumor architecture and induced an increase in MMP-9 activity that might facilitate gemcitabine penetrability. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that AV25CDC is an effective oncolytic agent candidate for pancreatic cancer chemovirotherapy combination.

"Expression of chimeras, composed of portions of two different glucose transporter isoforms (GLUT-1 and GLUT-4), in CHO cells had indicated that the cytoplasmic NH2 terminus of GLUT-4 contains important targeting information that mediates intracellular sequestration of this isoform (Piper, R. C., C. Tai, J. W. Slot, C. S. Hahn, C. M. Rice, H. Huang, D. E. James. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 117:729-743). In the present studies, the amino acid constituents of the GLUT-4 NH2-terminal targeting domain have been identified. GLUT-4 constructs containing NH2-terminal deletions or alanine substitutions within the NH2 terminus were expressed in CHO cells using a Sindbis virus expression system. Deletion of eight amino acids from the GLUT-4 NH2 terminus or substituting alanine for phenylalanine at position 5 in GLUT-4 resulted in a marked accumulation of the transporter at the plasma membrane. Mutations at other amino acids surrounding Phe5 also caused increased cell surface expression of GLUT-4 but not to the same extent as the Phe5 mutation. GLUT-4 was also localized to clathrin lattices and this colocalization was abolished when either the first 13 amino acids were deleted or when Phe5 was changed to alanine. To ascertain whether the targeting information within the GLUT-4 NH2-terminal targeting domain could function independently of the glucose transporter structure this domain was inserted into the cytoplasmic tail of the H1 subunit of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. H1 with the GLUT-4 NH2 terminus was predominantly localized to an intracellular compartment similar to GLUT-4 and was sequestered more from the cell surface than was the wild-type H1 protein. It is concluded that the NH2 terminus of GLUT-4 contains a phenylalanine-based targeting motif that mediates intracellular sequestration at least in part by facilitating interaction of the transporter with endocytic machinery located at the cell surface.

"BACKGROUND: Almost 1% of Canadians are hepatitis C (HCV)-infected. The liver-specific complications of HCV are established but the extra-hepatic comorbidity, multimorbidity, and its relationship with HCV treatment, is less well known. We describe the morbidity burden for people with HCV and the relationship between multimorbidity and HCV treatment uptake and cure in the pre- and post-direct acting antiviral (DAA) era. METHODS: We linked adults with HCV at The Ottawa Hospital Viral Hepatitis Program as of April 1, 2017 to provincial health administrative data and matched on age and sex to 5 Ottawa-area residents for comparison. We used validated algorithms to identify the prevalence of mental and physical health comorbidities, as well as multimorbidity (2+ comorbidities). We calculated direct age- and sex-standardized rates of comorbidity and comparisons were made by interferon-based and interferon-free, DAA HCV treatments. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 54.5 years (SD 11.4), 65% were male. Among those with HCV, 4% were HIV co-infected, 26% had liver cirrhosis, 47% received DAA treatment, and 57% were cured of HCV. After accounting for age and sex differences, the HCV group had greater multimorbidity (prevalence ratio (PR) 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 1.58) and physical-mental health multimorbidity (PR 2.71, 95% CI 2.29-3.20) compared to the general population. Specifically, prevalence ratios for people with HCV were significantly higher for diabetes, renal failure, cancer, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, substance use disorder, mood and anxiety disorders and liver failure. HCV treatment and cure were not associated with multimorbidity, but treatment prevalence was significantly lower among middle-aged individuals with substance use disorders despite no differences in prevalence of cure among those treated. CONCLUSION: People with HCV have a higher prevalence of comorbidity and multimorbidity compared to the general population. While HCV treatment was not associated with multimorbidity, people with substance use disorder were less likely to be treated. Our results point to the need for integrated, comprehensive models of care delivery for people with HCV.

"Woodchuck (Marmota monax) hepatic cells, which were immortalized by the simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 Tag) produced nitric oxide (NO; measured as nitrite) in vitro from L-arginine (L-Arg) after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment. NO synthesis was related to L-Arg and LPS concentration and plateaued at 1.0 mM L-Arg and 1.0 microgram/ml LPS. LPS-stimulated cells nitrosated morpholine to form N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) in the presence of L-Arg at pH 7.4. NMOR production increased 7-fold in LPS stimulated cells compared to unstimulated hepatocytes. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) was detected in the cell culture medium in the presence of LPS and L-Arg but without added dimethylamine. NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, a selective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, inhibited formation of NO and NMOR, indicating that NO and nitrosating agents were formed via the L-Arg-nitric oxide pathway. These data are the first to report NO and N-nitrosamine production by immortalized hepatocytes and confirm earlier work showing that primary hepatocytes form NO in culture. This suggests that hepatic formation of N-nitroso compounds and/or NO could be an etiologic factor in hepatocellular carcinoma. Immortalized woodchuck hepatic cells may be useful as in vitro models to study the L-Arg-nitric oxide pathway and its possible role in liver carcinogenesis.

"Hantavirus disease is a recently recognised zoonosis. The main vectors are infected but healthy wild rodents or laboratory rats. Transmission to man occurs via contact with, or inhalation of aerosolised excretions. The target organs in man are the kidney (Old World) or the lung (New World), probably via a local hyperproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To date, more than 33 different hantaviruses have been characterised, at least 14 of them being of clinical importance. Each serotype has its own rodent vector and its own geographical spread. In Europe, the red bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) is the main rodent vector, carrying the Puumala (PUU) serotype, which is the etiologic agent of a viral affection known as Nephropathia epidemica (NE). PUU infection has been recognised for the first time in Belgium in 1983. From this date on, approximately 500 cases have been diagnosed. In our regions, a diagnosis of hantavirus disease is mandatory when a febrile patient presents with lumbaches, headache, and an acute renal failure with proteinuria, and particularly with thrombocytopenia.

"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have concluded that the development of polydipsia (PD, a daily water intake ≥ 21 ml) among captive Danish bank voles, is associated with the development of a type 1 diabetes (T1D), based on findings of hyperglycaemia, glucosuria, ketonuria/-emia, lipemia, destroyed beta cells, and presence of autoantibodies against GAD65, IA-2, and insulin. AIM AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed data from two separate colonies of Danish bank voles in order to 1) estimate survivorship after onset of PD, 2) evaluate whether the weight of PD voles differed from non-PD voles, and, 3), evaluate a state of PD as a practical and non-invasive tool to screen for voles with a high probability of hypeglycaemia. In addition, we discuss regional differences related to the development of diabetes in Scandinavian bank voles and the relevance of the Ljungan virus as proposed etiological agent. RESULTS: We found that median survival after onset of PD is at least 91 days (lower/upper quartiles = 57/134 days) with a maximum recording of at least 404 days survivorship. The development of PD did not influence the weight of Danish bank voles. The measures of accuracy when using PD as predictor of hyperglycaemia, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, equalled 69%, 97%, 89%, and 89%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The relatively long survival of Danish PD bank voles suggests potentials for this model in future studies of the long-term complications of diabetes, of which some observations are mentioned. Data also indicates that diabetes in Danish bank is not associated with a higher body weight. Finally, the method of using measurements of daily water intake to screen for voles with a high probability of hyperglycaemia constitutes a considerable refinement when compared to the usual, invasive, methods.

"Riverbank filtration is an effective process for removing pathogenic viruses from river water. Despite indications that changing hydraulic conditions during floods can affect the efficacy of riverbank filtration to remove viruses, the impact on advection and dispersion of viruses in the riverbank is not well understood. We investigated the effects of fluctuations in river water level on virus transport during riverbank filtration, considering 3-D transient groundwater flow and virus transport. Using constant removal rates from published field experiments with bacteriophages, removal of viruses with distance from the riverbank was simulated for coarse gravel, fine gravel and fine sandy gravel. Our simulations showed that, in comparison with steady flow conditions, fluctuations in river water level cause viruses to be transported further at higher concentrations into the riverbank. A 1-5 m increase in river water levels led to a 2- to 4-log (log10 reduction in concentration relative to the initial concentration in the river) increase in virus concentration and to up to 30% shorter travel times. For particular cases during the receding flood, changing groundwater flow conditions caused that pristine groundwater was carried from further inland and that simulated virus concentrations were more diluted in groundwater. Our study suggests that the adverse effect of water level fluctuations on virus transport should be considered in the simulation of safe setback distances for drinking water supplies.

"A prospective and multi-centre study has allowed us to analyse antibody responses and Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolate genotypes on 24 consecutive HIV-TB co-infected patients treated with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) who either went on to develop a TB Immune Restoration Syndrome (TB-IRS), or not. Circulating free and immune-complexed antibodies against ManLAM, ESAT-6/CFP10 and PGL-Tb1 in HIV-TB co-infected patients were measured by ELISA at the initiation of anti-TB treatment, at the date of HAART initiation and thereafter. Presence of circulating B cells was also monitored by in vitro antibody production (IVAP) against ESAT-6/CFP10 and PGL-Tb1. Finally, 16 out of 24M. tuberculosis clinical isolates from patients with TB-IRS were genotyped using spoligotyping and MIRUs-VNTR typing. Eleven patients (45.8%) experienced TB-IRS (TB-IRS+). Significantly, lower anti-PGL-Tb1 antibody levels were identified in TB-IRS+ compared to TB-IRS-negative patients prior to TB-IRS development. These very low levels were neither related to CD4 counts nor with complexed antibodies. No difference in antibody levels was observed with the other tested antigens. In addition, no specific strain genotype was associated with TB-IRS. The presence of specific anti-PGL-Tb1 antibodies only in TB-IRS-negative patients represents for the first time an indicator of a potential protective response or a diagnostic biomarker for the detection of non-progression to TB-IRS in HIV-TB co-infected patients starting HAART.

"BACKGROUND: Suicide is a critical issue among opioid users. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between HCV status and suicidal risk in patients receiving methadone treatment. METHODS: We used data from Methaville, a multicenter, pragmatic randomized trial designed to evaluate the feasibility of methadone induction in primary care compared with induction in specialized centers. Suicidal risk was assessed at enrollment and after one year of methadone treatment using the suicidality module in the MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Socio-demographic characteristics, drug and alcohol consumption, behavioral and personality factors, history of drug use and health indicators were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 195 individuals were enrolled from January 2009 to December 2010. Suicidal risk assessment was available at month 0 (M0) and M12 for 159 (72%) and 118 (73%) individuals, respectively. Forty-four (28%) were at risk of suicide at M0 and 17 (14%) at M12 (p=0.004). One patient attempted suicide by overdose during the one-year follow-up. The following three factors were associated with suicidal risk: hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive status (OR [95%CI]=17.25 [1.14-161.07]; p=0.04), receiving food assistance (OR [95%CI]=0.05 [0.00-1.05]; p=0.05) and a higher number of health problems (OR [95%CI]=1.24 [1.08-1.44]; p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Special attention should be given to HCV-positive patients through suicidal risk prevention strategies and routine suicide assessment as part of a comprehensive approach to prevention and care for opioid users. Our results represent a new and powerful argument for the expansion of access to HCV treatment to drug users with chronic infection.

"The three-dimensional structure of a specific antibody (Fab 17/9) to a peptide immunogen from influenza virus hemagglutinin [HA1(75-110)] and two independent crystal complexes of this antibody with bound peptide (TyrP100-LeuP108) have been determined by x-ray crystallographic techniques at 2.0 A, 2.9 A, and 3.1 A resolution, respectively. The nonapeptide antigen assumes a type I beta turn in the antibody combining site and interacts primarily with the Fab hypervariable loops L3, H2, and H3. Comparison of the bound and unbound Fab structures shows that a major rearrangement in the H3 loop accompanies antigen binding. This conformational change results in the creation of a binding pocket for the beta turn of the peptide, allowing TyrP105 to be accommodated. The conformation of the peptide bound to the antibody shows similarity to its cognate sequence in the HA1, suggesting a possible mechanism for the cross-reactivity of this Fab with monomeric hemagglutinin. The structures of the free and antigen bound antibodies demonstrate the flexibility of the antibody combining site and provide an example of induced fit as a mechanism for antibody-antigen recognition.

"Climbing fiber (CF) input to the cerebellum is thought to instruct associative motor memory formation through its effects on multiple sites within the cerebellar circuit. We used adeno-associated viral delivery of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to inferior olivary neurons to selectively express ChR2 in CFs, achieving nearly complete transfection of CFs in the caudal cerebellar lobules of rats. As expected, optical stimulation of ChR2-expressing CFs generates complex spike responses in individual Purkinje neurons (PNs); in addition we found that such stimulation recruits a network of inhibitory interneurons in the molecular layer. This CF-driven disynaptic inhibition prolongs the postcomplex spike pause observed when spontaneously firing PNs receive direct CF input; such inhibition also elicits pauses in spontaneously firing PNs not receiving direct CF input. Baseline firing rates of PNs are strongly suppressed by low-frequency (2 Hz) stimulation of CFs, and this suppression is partly relieved by blocking synaptic inhibition. We conclude that CF-driven, disynaptic inhibition has a major influence on PN excitability and contributes to the widely observed negative correlation between complex and simple spike rates. Because they receive input from many CFs, molecular layer interneurons are well positioned to detect the spatiotemporal patterns of CF activity believed to encode error signals. Together, our findings suggest that such inhibition may bind together groups of Purkinje neurons to provide instructive signals to downstream sites in the cerebellar circuit.

"Hantavirus disease is a recently recognized zoonosis. The main vectors are infected but healthy wild rodents or laboratory rats. Transmission to man occurs via inhalation of aerosolised excretions. Kidneys or lungs are the target organs during the disease, but a systemic affection with multi-organ involvement is possible, and can be fatal. To date, at least 16 different serotypes of hantavirus have been characterized, 8 of them being of clinical importance. Each serotype has its own rodent vector and its own geographical spread. In Europe, the red bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) is the main rodent vector carrying the Puumala serotype which is the etiologic agent of a viral affection known as nephropathia epidemica (NE). Belgium witnessed in 1993 its most important NE outbreak with more than 60 cases in the southern part of the region between Sambre and Meuse, Chimay being the main focus.

"BACKGROUND: Recombinant adeno-associated virus vector (rAAV) is a promising vehicle for gene delivery, but few reports have documented its application in solid organ transplantation. In a rat orthotopic liver transplantation model, we investigated the efficacy of rAAV-mediated human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and immunoglobulin G (hCTLA4Ig) gene transfer to induce long-term allograft survival. METHODS: Dark Agouti and Lewis rats were used as donors and recipients, respectively, in six experimental groups: (a) syngeneic control, (b) no treatment, (c) rAAV-green fluorescent protein, (d) rAAV-hCTLA4Ig, (e) low-dose FK506 for 7 days, and (f) rAAV-hCTLA4Ig and low-dose FK506 for 7 days. RESULTS: The liver allografts were rejected within 10 days when no treatment was given or rAAV-green fluorescent protein was delivered. rAAV-hCTLA4Ig transduction slightly prolonged the survival time to 11 days. Long-term survival was achieved using the combined treatment of rAAV-hCTLA4Ig and low-dose FK506, whereas grafts were rejected on day 33 in the low-dose FK506 group. A sustained hCTLA4 level in plasma was detected in the combined treatment group from day 5 to day 180. On postoperative day 5, combined treatment significantly decreased the interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma protein levels in the grafts and the number of infiltrating B, T, CD25+, CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that rAAV-hCTLA4Ig gene transfer combined with low-dose FK506 can achieve long-term liver allograft survival.

"Sindbis virus, an enveloped virus with a single-stranded RNA genome, was engineered to express a bacterial protein, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), in cultured insect, avian, and mammalian cells. The vectors were self-replicating and gene expression was efficient and rapid; up to 10(8) CAT polypeptides were produced per infected cell in 16 to 20 hours. CAT expression could be made temperature-sensitive by means of a derivative that incorporated a temperature-sensitive mutation in viral RNA synthesis. Vector genomic RNAs were packaged into infectious particles when Sindbis helper virus was used to supply virion structural proteins. The vector RNAs were stable to at least seven cycles of infection. The expression of CAT increased about 10(3)-fold, despite a 10(15)-fold dilution during the passaging. Sindbis virus vectors should prove useful for expressing large quantities of gene products in a variety of animal cells.

"A survey of rabbit populations in the southern tablelands of New South Wales, Australia, was carried out to establish the pattern of occurrence of myxomatosis in preparation for a deliberate release of myxoma virus. Myxomatosis was first detected in December and cases were found on most sites through to May. The serological profiles of rabbit populations suggested that their susceptibility to myxoma virus was generally low in winter and highest in spring and summer reflecting the presence of increasing numbers of susceptible young rabbits. This was consistent with the pattern of rabbit breeding, as determined from the distribution of births and reproductive activity in females and males, which occurred maximally in spring and early summer. The serology and age structure of rabbit populations on sites suggested that some rabbit populations can escape an annual myxomatosis epizootic. Although fleas were present on rabbits throughout the year and therefore not considered to be a limiting factor in the spread of myxomatosis, their numbers peaked at times coincident with peak rabbit breeding. It was concluded that mid to late spring was an optimal time for a deliberate release.

"In natural infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (HBc) accumulates frequent mutations. The most frequent HBc variant in chronic hepatitis B patients is mutant 97L, changing from an isoleucine or phenylalanine to a leucine (L) at HBc amino acid 97. One dogma in the HBV research field is that wild type HBV secretes predominantly virions containing mature double-stranded DNA genomes. Immature genomes, containing single-stranded RNA or DNA, do not get efficiently secreted until reaching genome maturity. Interestingly, HBc variant 97L does not follow this dogma in virion secretion. Instead, it exhibits an immature secretion phenotype, which preferentially secretes virions containing immature genomes. Other aberrant behaviors in virion secretion were also observed in different naturally occurring HBc variants. A hydrophobic pocket around amino acid 97 was identified by bioinformatics, genetic analysis, and cryo-EM. We postulated that this hydrophobic pocket could mediate the transduction of the genome maturation signal for envelopment from the capsid interior to its surface. Virion morphogenesis must involve interactions between HBc, envelope proteins (HBsAg) and host factors, such as components of ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport). Immature secretion can be offset by compensatory mutations, occurring at other positions in HBc or HBsAg. Recently, we demonstrated in mice that the persistence of intrahepatic HBV DNA is related to virion secretion regulated by HBV genome maturity. HBV virion secretion could be an antiviral drug target.

"Retroviral vectors have been constructed for gene transfer in mammalian and avian cells, however most retroviral vector systems are complicated by the spread of a replication-competent helper virus. This problem has been circumvented by segregating the viral genome into cis- and trans-acting components. By establishing helper cell lines that produce the trans-acting viral gene products, one can propagate the cis-acting component in them and harvest defective viral particles that contain only the cis-acting component. The cis-acting component can provide a useful vehicle for the highly efficient transfer of genes into target cells. The defective vector systems described to date, however, are restricted in host range to murine, avian, rat, and dog cells. We describe a helper-free vector system based entirely on an amphotropic murine virus with a wide mammalian host range, including the ability to carry out efficient gene transfer into human cells. We also describe a double mutation constructed in the trans-acting genome which reduces the frequency of replication-competent recombinant viruses to undetectable levels.

"Brefeldin A (BFA) was shown in earlier studies of numerous cell types to inhibit secretion, induce enzymes of the Golgi stacks to redistribute into the ER, and to cause the Golgi cisternae to disappear. Here, we demonstrate that the PtK1 line of rat kangaroo kidney cells is resistant to BFA. The drug did not disrupt the morphology of the Golgi complex in PtK1 cells, as judged by immunofluorescence using antibodies to 58- (58K) and 110-kD (beta-COP) Golgi proteins, and by fluorescence microscopy of live cells labeled with C6-NBD-ceramide. In addition, BFA did not inhibit protein secretion, not alter the kinetics or extent of glycosylation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein (G-protein) in VSV-infected PtK1 cells. To explore the mechanism of resistance to BFA, PtK1 cells were fused with BFA-sensitive CV-1 cells that had been infected with a recombinant SV-40 strain containing the gene for VSV G-protein and, at various times following fusion, the cultures were exposed to BFA. Shortly after cell fusion, heterokaryons contained one Golgi complex associated with each nucleus. Golgi membranes derived from CV-1 cells were sensitive to BFA, whereas those of PtK1 origin were BFA resistant. A few hours after fusion, most heterokaryons contained a single, large Golgi apparatus that was resistant to BFA and contained CV-1 galactosyltransferase. In unfused cells that had been perforated using nitrocellulose filters, retention of beta-COP on the Golgi was optimal in the presence of cytosol, ATP, and GTP. In perforated cell models of the BFA-sensitive MA104 line, BFA caused beta-COP to be released from the Golgi complex in the presence of nucleotides, and either MA104 or PtK1 cytosol. In contrast, when perforated PtK1 cells were incubated with BFA, nucleotides, and cytosol from either cell type, beta-COP remained bound to the Golgi complex. We conclude that PtK1 cells contain a nondiffusible factor, which is located on or very close to the Golgi complex, and confers a dominant resistance to BFA. It is possible that this factor is homologous to the target of BFA in cells that are sensitive to the drug.

"To examine the role of the brain stem melanocortin system in long-term energy regulation, we assessed the effects of overproduction of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the caudal brain stem of F344xBN rats with adult-onset obesity. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vector encoding POMC gene was delivered to the nucleus of solitary tract (NTS) in the hindbrain, and food intake, body weight, glucose and fat metabolism, brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, and mRNA levels of neuropeptides and melanocortin receptors were assessed. POMC delivery resulted in sustained reduction in food intake and body weight over 42 days and improved insulin sensitivity. At death, in recombinant adeno-associated viral vector-POMC-treated rats vs. control rats, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in NTS increased nearly 21-fold, whereas hypothalamic alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone remained unchanged. Visceral adiposity decreased by 37%; tissue triglyceride content diminished by 26% and 47% in liver and muscle, respectively; serum triglyceride and nonesterified fatty acids were reduced by 35% and 34%, respectively; phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase was elevated by 63% in soleus muscle; brown adipose tissue uncoupling protein 1 increased by 30%; and melanocortin 3 receptor expression declined by 60%, whereas neuropeptide Y, agouti-related protein, and MC4 receptor mRNA levels were unchanged in the NTS. In conclusion, POMC overexpression in the NTS produces a characteristic unabated hypophagia that is uniquely different from the anorexic tachyphylaxis following POMC overexpression in the hypothalamus. The sustained anorectic response may result from absence of compensatory elements in the NTS, such as increased agouti-related protein expression, suggesting melanocortin activation of the brain stem may be a viable strategy to alleviate obesity.

"A retrospective review of 130 patients with peripheral-type cholangiocarcinomas (PTCC), hilar-type cholangiocarcinomas (HTCC), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (EHCC), gallbladder cancers (GBCA), and periampullary cancers (PACA), seen at National Cheng Kung University Hospital and Tainan Municipal Hospital from June 1987 to July 1993 was performed. There were 47 (36%) HTCC, 32 (25%) PACA, 24 (19%) PTCC, 17 (13%) GBCA, and 10 (8%) EHCC patients. The distribution is completely different from that reported in western countries. These cancers mainly occur in elderly patients. HTCC and GBCA were predominantly noted in female patients. Biliary cancers in Taiwan were not related to liver fluke infestation, inflammatory bowel disease or hepatitis B virus infection. However, a close association with biliary lithiasis was found. The incidence of gallstones was 67, 39, 20, 29 and 19% for PTCC, HTCC, EHCC, GBCA and PACA, respectively. The most common presentation for PTCC and GBCA was abdominal pain, or jaundice for HTCC, EHCC and PACA. These symptoms correlate well with the location of the tumors. Among serum tumor markers, the elevation of CA19-9 was most frequent, occurring in 86% of the patients while CA125 and CEA occurred in 47% and 30% of the patients, respectively. During the course of disease, infection developed in 61% of the patients and was the main cause of death in 25%. Biliary tract infection and sepsis were the two leading manifestations and occurred in 49% and 32% of the patients, respectively. Overall survival was poor except in patients whose tumor could be completely resected.

"Baculovirus vectors show promise as a novel tool for gene delivery into mammalian cells and gene transfer with wild-type baculovirus has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. To study expression and intracellular trafficking of foreign viral membrane proteins in baculovirus-transduced mammalian cells, the envelope proteins, E1 and E2, of rubella virus (RV) were chosen as a model. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and a red fluorescent protein (RFP) were fused to the C-terminus of E1 and E2, respectively. The proteins were cloned under a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and expressed as fluorescent fusion proteins in baculovirus-transduced baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. Expression of the chimeric proteins in these cells showed that E1 was retained within the ER and cis-Golgi when expressed alone. In contrast, E2 was efficiently transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). However, when expressed together, E1 co-localized with E2 in TGN and to some extent in the lysosomes. The recombinant baculovirus vectors were able to transduce the BHK cells efficiently and the fluorescent fusion constructs allowed easy detection of the trafficking events in the transduced mammalian cells. Consequently, this technique should have wide applications when intracellular analysis of protein synthesis and maturation is under study.

"Sigmodontine rodents are poorly studied and have not received much attention as a reproductive model. Renewed interest in the South American rodents has been stimulated by their link to endemic diseases that are transmitted to man. Calomys laucha acts as a reservoir of two dangerous viruses: an arenavirus named 'Junin virus', the aetiological agent of Argentinian haemorrhagic fever, and the hantavirus, both of which constitute serious sanitary problems. The aim of this study was to establish suitable conditions to superovulate the vesper mouse, Calomys laucha. We examined the hormonal doses, the time interval between hormones, the time-course of ovulation, and the effect of female age on the response to exogenous hormone administration. Female mice were injected with 5-5, 8-8 or 12-15 IU of PMSG/hCG, 48 h apart, at different age intervals (from 30 to > 120 days old). The best superovulation rate was obtained with 8-8 IU PMSG/hCG. Ovulation started about 10 h post-hCG and was completed during the next 4-5 h, and was achieved irrespectively from the oestrus cycle stage. The number of oocytes was influenced by the age of the females. The youngest females had only a superovulatory response. Females older than 61 days showed both ovulatory and superovulatory responses, although 91-120-day-old females had a high ovulatory response. Most of the oocytes (96.5%) recovered were morphologically normal. The genus Calomys constitutes a reproductive model completely different from conventional laboratory rodents.

"A woodchuck-derived hepatitis delta virus (HDV) inoculum was created by transfection of a genotype I HDV cDNA clone directly into the liver of a woodchuck that was chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus. All woodchucks receiving this inoculum became positive for HDV RNA in serum, and 67% became chronically infected, similar to the rate of chronic HDV infection in humans. Analysis of HDV sequences obtained at 73 weeks postinfection indicated that changes had occurred at a rate of 0.5% per year; many of these modifications were consistent with editing by host RNA adenosine deaminase. The appearance of sequence changes, which were not evenly distributed on the genome, was correlated with the course of HDV infection. A limited number of modifications occurred in the consensus sequence of the viral genome that altered the sequence of the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg). All chronically infected animals examined exhibited these changes 73 weeks following infection, but at earlier times, only one of the HDV carriers exhibited consensus sequence substitutions. On the other hand, sequence modifications in animals that eventually recovered from HDV infection were apparent after 27 weeks. The data are consistent with a model in which HDV sequence changes are selected by host immune responses. Chronic HDV infection in woodchucks may result from a delayed and weak immune response that is limited to a small number of epitopes on HDAg.

"The New Zealand white rabbit model (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is widely used to test whether HIV vaccine candidates elicit systemic antibody responses; however, its use in mucosal immunology has not been fully exploited due to the difficulty in collecting mucosal specimens longitudinally and reproducibly. Here we describe feasible and non-feasible methods to collect vaginal and nasal specimens from nulliparous rabbits. Non-feasible methods were those resulting in poor reproducibility and considerable animal twitching during sampling, whereas feasible methods resulted in no animal twitching and potential for sampling reproducibility. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were implemented to collect vaginal swabs yielding total IgA titres ranging from 12,500 to 312,500. Intranasal immunisation with a naked DNA vaccine encoding HIV gp140 elicited HIV envelope-specific IgA detectable in nasal but not in vaginal secretions. Our methods provide an alternative to reliably assess pre- and post-vaccination mucosal antibody titres longitudinally in rabbits as part of mucosal HIV vaccine immunogenicity studies.

"BACKGROUND: Recent studies in human have highlighted the importance of the monocyte chemotactic proteins (MCP) in leukocyte trafficking and their effects in inflammatory processes, tumor progression, and HIV-1 infection. In European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) one of the prime MCP targets, the chemokine receptor CCR5 underwent a unique structural alteration. Until now, no homologue of MCP-2/CCL8a, MCP-3/CCL7 or MCP-4/CCL13 genes have been reported for this species. This is interesting, because at least the first two genes are expressed in most, if not all, mammals studied, and appear to be implicated in a variety of important chemokine ligand-receptor interactions. By assessing the Rabbit Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) data we have searched for orthologs of the mammalian genes of the MCP-Eotaxin cluster. RESULTS: We have localized the orthologs of these chemokine genes in the genome of European rabbit and compared them to those of leporid genera which do (i.e. Oryctolagus and Bunolagus) or do not share the CCR5 alteration with European rabbit (i.e. Lepus and Sylvilagus). Of the Rabbit orthologs of the CCL8, CCL7, and CCL13 genes only the last two were potentially functional, although showing some structural anomalies at the protein level. The ortholog of MCP-2/CCL8 appeared to be pseudogenized by deleterious nucleotide substitutions affecting exon1 and exon2. By analyzing both genomic and cDNA products, these studies were extended to wild specimens of four genera of the Leporidae family: Oryctolagus, Bunolagus, Lepus, and Sylvilagus. It appeared that the anomalies of the MCP-3/CCL7 and MCP-4/CCL13 proteins are shared among the different species of leporids. In contrast, whereas MCP-2/CCL8 was pseudogenized in every studied specimen of the Oryctolagus - Bunolagus lineage, this gene was intact in species of the Lepus - Sylvilagus lineage, and was, at least in Lepus, correctly transcribed. CONCLUSION: The biological function of a gene was often revealed in situations of dysfunction or gene loss. Infections with Myxoma virus (MYXV) tend to be fatal in European rabbit (genus Oryctolagus), while being harmless in Hares (genus Lepus) and benign in Cottontail rabbit (genus Sylvilagus), the natural hosts of the virus. This communication should stimulate research on a possible role of MCP-2/CCL8 in poxvirus related pathogenicity.

"We investigated the long-term effects of physiological levels of leptin produced by gene therapy on body weight (BW) and expression of genes that encode orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides in the hypothalamus. Recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV), a non-pathogenic and non-immunogenic vector, encoding leptin (betaOb) was generated and administered iv to ob/ob mice lacking endogenous leptin. Whereas the lowest dose of rAAV-betaOb (6x10(9) particles) was ineffective, the middle dose (6x10(10) particles) curbed BW gain without affecting food consumption for 75 days of observation. A ten-fold higher dose (6x10(11) particles) resulted in increased blood leptin levels and suppressed both BW gain and food consumption throughout the duration of the experiment. rAAV-betaOb doses that either curbed BW without affecting food consumption or evoked BW loss and reduced food intake, decreased the expression of genes encoding the orexigenic peptides, neuropeptide Y and agouti-related peptide in the ARC, and the two doses were equally effective. Concomitantly, the expression of genes encoding the anorexigenic peptide, alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and cocaine-and-amphetamine regulatory transcript, was augmented with the latter gene displaying a dose-dependant response. These results document the efficacy of delivering biologically active leptin for extended periods by an iv injection of rAAV-betaOb and show that physiological leptin concentrations simultaneously exert a tonic inhibitory effect on orexigenic and a stimulatory effect on anorexigenic signaling in the hypothalamus. This intricate dynamic interplay induced by leptin regulates BW with or without an effect on food intake in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Further, these results suggest that gene therapy is an effective mode of delivery to the hypothalamus of those therapeutic proteins that cross the blood-brain barrier to ameliorate neuroendocrine disorders.

"Cell proliferation and terminal differentiation are mutually exclusive in most cell lineages. The b-zip transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) induces proliferation arrest and differentiation in many cell types, suggesting that both activities are linked. Here we show that C/EBPalpha-mediated proliferation arrest and differentiation pathways can be separated by the E7 oncoprotein of the ""high-risk"" human papilloma virus 16. The E7 oncoprotein overrides C/EBPalpha-mediated cell cycle withdrawal without compromising the transactivation activity of C/EBPalpha or its ability to participate in differentiation. Uncoupling of both pathways depends on the casein kinase II site of the oncoprotein but not on its ability to neutralize pocket proteins or the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21. Our results suggest a bifurcation of C/EBPalpha-mediated proliferation arrest and differentiation pathways.

"Photoinactivation was employed to eliminate EHDV-2 from in vitro produced bovine embryos experimentally exposed to this virus. Immature oocytes were matured, fertilized, and cultured in chemically defined conditions. All treatments were performed on zygotes. Developmental potential of zygotes and cell numbers of resulting hatched blastocysts were assessed after exposure to a 1 mW helium neon laser (633 nm, red) for 1, 5, 10, and 15 min; the photosensitive chemicals hematoporphyrin (15 microM) and hypericin (1 and 10 microM) for 15 min; a combination of 10 microM hypericin and laser light for 1, 3, or 5 min; and a combination of 15 microM hematoporphyrin and laser light for 1, 2, or 3 min. There were no significant differences among proportions of embryos developing or cell numbers after treatment with or without exposure to laser light alone for up to 10 min. No differences were observed after exposure of zygotes to photosensitive chemicals alone. Exposure to 10 microM hypericin and 5 min of laser light or 15 microM hematoporphyrin and 2 min of laser light compromised zygote developmental potential. After exposure to 10(6) TCID50/mL EHDV-2 for 90 min groups of 10 zygotes were exposed to 10 microM hypericin or 15 microM hematoporphyrin and laser light to inactivate the virus. Hematoporphyrin was effective with 3 min light exposure at reducing the percentage of EHDV-2 contaminated zygote pools (16.7%) as compared to EHDV-2 exposed pools without treatment (88.9%) but hematoporphyrin + 1 min light was ineffective. Hypericin + 3 min light provided an intermediate effect (55.6%).

"The present study has investigated the use of gene trap retroviruses as insertional mutagens. A gene trap vector (U3Hygro) was used to target single-copy thymidine kinase (tk) genes, present at different sites in the genome. Cell populations isolated by gene trap selection contained a higher proportion of insertional mutants as compared with nonselected cells containing randomly integrated viruses. The number of integration events required to observe loss of gene function was reduced from 8-40 x 10(6) to 2-10 x 10(4), an overall enrichment of 100- to 1000-fold. The feasibility of targeting normally diploid genes was also demonstrated in hypodiploid Chinese hamster ovary cells. The cellular gene encoding GlcNAc transferase I was disrupted in one wheat germ agglutinin resistant clone selected from a total of 5 x 10(4) gene trap events. The clone was nullizygous for GlcNAc transferase I, indicating that the allele opposite the provirus was lost as a result of preexisting hemizygosity or by loss of heterozygosity. Finally, the total number of genes in the genome that could activate the expression of retrovirus gene traps was estimated at between 2 x 10(4) and 10(5), suggesting that most expressed genes can be mutagenized by gene trap selection.

"Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder likely caused by environmental and genetic risk factors but functional interactions between the risk factors are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that dysbindin-1 (Dtnbp1) gene mutation combined with postnatal exposure to viral mimetic polyI:C results in schizophrenia-related behavioural changes in adulthood, and mediates polyI:C-induced inflammation in the subventricular zone (SVZ). Adult Sandy (Sdy, Dtnbp1 mutant) mice given early postnatal polyI:C injections displayed reduced prepulse inhibition of startle, reduced locomotion and deficits in novel object recognition. PolyI:C induced a canonical immune response in the SVZ; it increased mRNA expression of its toll-like receptor 3 (Tlr3) and downstream transcription factors RelA and Sp1. PolyI:C also increased SVZ Dtnbp1 mRNA expression, suggesting dysbindin-1 regulates immune responses. Dysbindin-1 loss in Sdy mice blocked the polyI:C-induced increases in mRNA expression of Tlr3, RelA and Sp1 in the SVZ. Dtnbp1 overexpression in SVZ-derived Sdy neurospheres rescued Tlr3, RelA and Sp1 mRNA expression supporting a functional interaction between dysbindin-1 and polyI:C-induced inflammation. Immunohistochemistry showed higher Iba1+ immune cell density in the SVZ of Sdy mice than in WT postnatally. PolyI:C did not alter SVZ Iba1+ cell density but increased CD45+/Iba1- cell numbers in the SVZ of Sdy mice. Finally, polyI:C injections in Sdy, but not WT mice reduced postnatal and adult SVZ proliferation. Together, we show novel functional interactions between the schizophrenia-relevant dysbindin-1 gene and the immune response to polyI:C. This work sheds light on the molecular basis for amplified abnormalities due to combined genetic predisposition and exposure to environmental schizophrenia risk factors.

"During development and subsequent field evaluation of an oral vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine, 53 adult porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum; 38 females and 15 males) were examined. Microscopic examinations revealed the presence of giant epitheloid cells in various tissues (adrenal glands, spleen, liver, and lungs) of 4 (11%) female animals. These giant cells were approximately 20 times the size of the surrounding cells of the parenchyma. The cells were found singly and were not associated with any inflammatory cellular infiltrate and appeared to be located within vascular lumina. Morphologically these cells were typical of uterine epitheloid trophoblasts. This is the first record of the presence of trophoblast-like cells in nongenital tissues of porcupines.

"Transformation of normal melanocytes to metastatic melanoma cells is characterized by loss of dependency on external growth factors required for the viability and proliferation of normal melanocytes. The molecular events that lead to melanoma cell autonomous growth are not well defined, but are likely to include sustained activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6) as a result of loss of CDK inhibitors (such as p16INK4a and possibly p27KIP1), and persistent upregulation of several cyclins (cyclin D1, cyclin A and cyclin E), the positive regulators of CDKs. CDKs phosphorylate, and consequently, inactivate the retinoblastoma family of tumor suppressor proteins (pRb, p107 and p130), termed pocket proteins. The inactivation of pocket proteins liberates E2F transcription factors from suppressive complexes ('free' E2F) that, in turn, induces the continuous expression of target genes whose products promote cell cycle progression. In normal melanocytes, external growth factors suppress the activity of all three pocket proteins, allowing E2F activity to accumulate and sustain transcription of target genes required for cell proliferation. In contrast, in melanoma cells from advanced lesions, all three pocket proteins are highly phosphorylated and inactive, even in the absence of environmental mitogens, and free E2F activity is constitutively high. Manipulations of normal mouse melanocytes in vitro, and in vivo in transgenic mouse expressing ectopic genes, further support the notion that growth rate, and release from dependency on external mitogens, positively correlate with inactivation of pocket proteins. The latter has been accomplished by sustained cell surface receptor stimulation, such as constitutive high expression of a growth factor, or by sequestration with dominantly acting viral proteins. Taken together, chronic hyperphosphorlyation/inactivation of pRb, p107 and p130 is probably one of the key events in converting growth-factor dependent normal melanocytes, to autonomously growing melanoma cells. Since all pocket proteins are regulated by CDKs activity, it is likely that agents that inhibit this class of enzymes will be effective in treating melanoma patients.

"Since the recovery of infectious RNA transcripts from full-length cDNA clones, alphavirus genome RNAs have been engineered to allow expression of heterologous RNAs and proteins. The highest levels of expression of heterologous products are achieved when the viral structural genes are replaced by the heterologous coding sequences. Such recombinant RNAs are self-replicating (replicons) and can be introduced into cells as naked RNA, but they require trans complementation to be packaged and released from cells as infectious virion particles. In this report, we describe a series of defective Sindbis virus helper RNAs which can be used for packaging Sindbis virus RNA replicons. The defective helper RNAs contain the cis-acting sequences required for replication as well as the subgenomic RNA promoter which drives expression of the structural protein genes. In cells cotransfected with both the replicon and defective helper RNAs, viral nonstructural proteins translated from the replicon RNA allow replication and transcription of the defective helper RNA to produce the virion structural proteins. A series of defective helper RNAs were compared for the ability to package the replicon RNA as well as for the ability to be replicated and packaged. One defective helper RNA not only packaged the replicon but also was itself encapsidated and would be useful under conditions in which extensive amplification is advantageous. Other defective helper RNAs were able to package the replicon efficiently but were packaged very poorly themselves. These helpers should be useful for applications in which expression of the viral structural proteins or virus spread is not desired.

"The identification of an effective and tolerable delivery method is a necessity for the success of DNA vaccines in the clinic. This manuscript describes the development and validation of a multi-headed intradermal electroporation device which would be applicable for delivering multiple DNA vaccine plasmids simultaneously but spatially separated. Reporter gene plasmids expressing green and red fluorescent proteins were used to demonstrate the impact of spatial separation on DNA delivery to increase the number of transfected cells and avoid interference through visible expression patterns. To investigate the impact of plasmid interference on immunogenicity, a disease target was investigated where issues with multi-valent vaccines had been previously described. DNA-based Hantaan and Puumala virus vaccines were delivered separately or as a combination and the effect of multi-valence was determined by appropriate assays. While a negative impact was observed for both antigenic vaccines when delivered together, these effects were mitigated when the vaccine was delivered using the multi-head device. We also demonstrate how the multi-head device facilitates higher dose delivery to the skin resulting in improved immune responses. This new multi-head platform device is an efficient, tolerable and non-invasive method to deliver multiple plasmid DNA constructs simultaneously allowing the tailoring of delivery sites for combination vaccines. Additionally, this device would allow the delivery of multi-plasmid vaccine formulations without risk of impacted immune responses through interference. Such a low-cost, easy to use device platform for the delivery of multi-agent DNA vaccines would have direct applications by the military and healthcare sectors for mass vaccination purposes.

"The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system is involved in the regulation of multiple behaviors, including feeding, and evidence demonstrates that the melanocortin system can act on the mesolimbic DA system to control feeding and other behaviors. The melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is an important component of the melanocortin system, but its overall role is poorly understood. Because MC3Rs are highly expressed in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and are likely to be the key interaction point between the melanocortin and mesolimbic DA systems, we set out to identify both the efferent projection patterns of VTA MC3R neurons and the location of the neurons providing afferent input to them. VTA MC3R neurons were broadly connected to neurons across the brain but were strongly connected to a discrete set of brain regions involved in the regulation of feeding, reward, and aversion. Surprisingly, experiments using monosynaptic rabies virus showed that proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus made few direct synapses onto VTA MC3R neurons or any of the other major neuronal subtypes in the VTA, despite being extensively labeled by general retrograde tracers injected into the VTA. These results greatly contribute to our understanding of the anatomical interactions between the melanocortin and mesolimbic systems and provide a foundation for future studies of VTA MC3R neurons and the circuits containing them in the control of feeding and other behaviors.

"Invasive, non-native species are one of the major causes of global biodiversity loss. Although they are, by definition, successful in their non-native range, their populations generally show major reductions in their genetic diversity during the demographic bottleneck they experience during colonization. By investigating the mitochondrial genetic diversity of an invasive non-native species, the stoat Mustela erminea, in New Zealand and comparing it to diversity in the species' native range in Great Britain, we reveal the opposite effect. We demonstrate that the New Zealand stoat population contains four mitochondrial haplotypes that have not been found in the native range. Stoats in Britain rely heavily on introduced rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus as their primary prey and were introduced to New Zealand in a misguided attempt at biological control of rabbits, which had also been introduced there. While invasive stoats have since decimated the New Zealand avifauna, native stoat populations were themselves decimated by the introduction to Britain of Myxoma virus as a control measure for rabbits. We highlight the irony that while introduced species (rabbits) and subsequent biocontrol (myxomatosis) have caused population crashes of native stoats, invasive stoats in New Zealand, which were also introduced for biological control, now contain more genetic haplotypes than their most likely native source.

"The E2 envelope glycoprotein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) binds to the host entry factor CD81 and is the principal target for neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Most NAbs recognize hypervariable region 1 on E2, which undergoes frequent mutation, thereby allowing the virus to evade neutralization. Consequently, there is great interest in NAbs that target conserved epitopes. One such NAb is AP33, a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes a conserved, linear epitope on E2 and potently neutralizes a broad range of HCV genotypes. In this study, the X-ray structure of AP33 Fab in complex with an epitope peptide spanning residues 412 to 423 of HCV E2 was determined to 1.8 Å. In the complex, the peptide adopts a β-hairpin conformation and docks into a deep binding pocket on the antibody. The major determinants of antibody recognition are E2 residues L413, N415, G418, and W420. The structure is compared to the recently described HCV1 Fab in complex with the same epitope. Interestingly, the antigen-binding sites of HCV1 and AP33 are completely different, whereas the peptide conformation is very similar in the two structures. Mutagenesis of the peptide-binding residues on AP33 confirmed that these residues are also critical for AP33 recognition of whole E2, confirming that the peptide-bound structure truly represents AP33 interaction with the intact glycoprotein. The slightly conformation-sensitive character of the AP33-E2 interaction was explored by cross-competition analysis and alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The structural details of this neutralizing epitope provide a starting point for the design of an immunogen capable of eliciting AP33-like antibodies.

"The incidence and antibody prevalence of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Bashkirtostan (European part of Russia) and northern Sweden was compared with the abundance of Clethrionomys glareolus (bank voles) in the two areas. In Bashkirtostan, 10% of the women and 15% of the men were found to be antibody positive. The corresponding figures for Sweden were 8% and 16% for women and men, respectively. The annual incidence of HFRS in Bashkirtostan was 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with a male:female ratio of 4.6:1. The incidence in the endemic area of Sweden was seven cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with a male:female ratio of 1.8:1. A similar age distribution of cases, with a peak in the middle age groups, especially in men, was found in both Bashkirtostan and Sweden. The incidence of HFRS in humans and the abundance of bank voles varied with time in both Bashkirtostan and Sweden, but the study failed to find any significant correlation between the two variables. The study showed that HFRS causes significant human morbidity in the areas studied but that both incidence and possibly bank vole abundance was higher in Bashkirtostan than in northern Sweden.

"In the 8;21 translocation, the AML1 gene, located at chromosome band 21q22, is translocated to chromosome 8 (q22), where it is fused to the ETO gene and transcribed as a chimeric gene. AML1 is the human homolog of the recently cloned mouse gene pebp2 alpha B, homologous to the DNA binding alpha subunit of the polyoma enhancer factor pebp2. AML1 is also involved in a translocation with chromosome 3 that is seen in patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and in chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. We have isolated a fusion cDNA clone from a t(3;21) library derived from a patient with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome; this clone contains sequences from AML1 and from EAP, which we have now localized to band 3q26. EAP has previously been characterized as a highly expressed small nuclear protein of 128 residues (EBER 1) associated with Epstein-Barr virus small RNA. The fusion clone contains the DNA binding 5' part of AML1 that is fused to ETO in the t(8;21) and, in addition, at least one other exon. The translocation replaces the last nine codons of AML1 with the last 96 codons of EAP. The fusion does not maintain the correct reading frame of EAP and may not lead to a functional chimeric protein.

"Disordered growth and glucose metabolism secondary to growth hormone deficiency is associated with persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. C3H/St, BALB/WEHI, and SWR/J mice infected at birth with LCMV:ARM carried virus in their blood and organs throughout life but only C3H/St mice developed growth hormone insufficiency. BALB/WEHI and SWR/J infected mice contained normal amounts of growth hormone in their pituitaries and a relatively small proportion of the cells containing growth hormone replicated the virus. In susceptible C3H/St mice, the disease-causing viral strains (LCMV:ARM, E-350, and Pasteur) replicated to higher titers and infected the vast majority of cells producing growth hormone in the anterior lobe of the pituitary. In contrast, LCMV strains Traub and WE replicated in far fewer growth hormone-producing cells and failed to disorder growth hormone synthesis. In another paper (Y. Riviere, R. Ahmed, P. Southern, and M. B. A. Oldstone (1985), Virology 142, 175-182) these findings are used to make reassortants between LCMV:ARM (disease positive) and LCMV:WE (disease nil) and the pathogenic effect is mapped to the small RNA segment of LCMV:ARM. Peptides cleaved by trypsin and chymotrypsin from growth hormone molecules isolated from infected cells or control cells were equivalent when examined by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Further, transfer of antibody to interferon failed to alter the growth hormone insufficiency in these mice, although it corrected LCMV-induced liver disease of BALB mice, suggesting that interferon did not play a dominant role in this disease. The selective tropism of LCMV:ARM for cells containing growth hormone over cells that contain prolactin was observed in both infected animals and in cultured GH-3 cells.

"OBJECTIVES: To identify a simplified factor structure for the PROQOL-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) questionnaire to improve the measurement of the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of HIV-positive patients in clinical care and research settings. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: HRQL data were collected using the eight-dimension PROQOL-HIV questionnaire from 2,537 patients (VESPA2 study). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) validated a simpler four-factor structure and assessed measurement invariance (MI). Multigroup analysis assessed the effect of sex, age, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the resulting factor scores. Correlations with symptom and Short Form (SF)-12 self-reports assessed convergent validity. RESULTS: Item analysis, EFA, and CFAs confirmed the validity [comparative fit index (CFI), 0.948; root mean square error of approximation, 0.064] and reliability (α's ≥ 0.8) of four dimensions: physical health and symptoms, health concerns and mental distress, social and intimate relationships, and treatment-related impact. Strong MI was demonstrated across sex and age (decrease in CFI <0.01). A multiple-cause multiple-indicator model indicated that HRQL correlated as expected with sex, age, and the ART status. Correlations of HRQL, symptom reports, and SF-12 scores evidenced convergent validity criterion. CONCLUSION: The simplified factor structure and scoring scheme for PROQOL-HIV will allow clinicians to monitor with greater reliability the HRQL of patients in clinical care and research settings.

"BACKGROUND: Harm reduction is a central tenet of Housing First. As the intervention has been shown to stably house people experiencing chronic homelessness across the lifespan with complex behavioural health needs, it is critical to understand the harm reduction outcomes and practices in Housing First. METHODS: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted of five databases: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. Harm reduction outcomes and practices in Housing First were examined in four domains: substance-related harms, viral health, sexual health, and harm reduction service use. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles were included in the review, 23 of which examined harm reduction outcomes and 12 of which investigated harm reduction practices in Housing First. Harm reduction outcome studies focused mostly on nonspecific substance use problems, with Housing First being found to have minimal effects in this domain. More severe harms, such as delirium tremens and substance use-related deaths, have been minimally explored, though preliminary evidence is promising. Viral health, sexual health, and harm reduction service use outcomes were the focus of few studies. Research on harm reduction practices highlighted that Housing First providers experience both flexibility and ambiguity in their work using a harm reduction approach, and the importance of empathetic working relationships for engagement in harm reduction work. CONCLUSIONS: Harm reduction outcomes in Housing First remain underexamined and any conclusions of the intervention's impacts in this domain would be premature. Effective harm reduction practices in Housing First require strong working relationships between staff and tenants.

"The removal of seeded coliphage f2 and indigenous enteroviruses from primary and secondary wastewaters applied by spray irrigation to sandy loam and silt loam soils in field test cells was examined. The amount of f2 recovered from 170-cm-deep soil percolate samples taken over a 53-day period never exceeded 0.1% of applied virus levels and was usually below detection limits. Indigenous enterovirus levels in percolate waters also constituted only a small portion of those found in the wastewaters. At 10 days after seeding, f2 virus was present throughout the soil column but tended to accumulate around the soil core middepths. Coliphage f2 disappeared from the soil surface regions at a high rate, and by 53 days very little virus could be detected within the length of the soil columns. Sterilized soil core segments from different depths were studied to determine their virus adsorption capabilities when suspended in either wastewater, test cell percolate water, or distilled water containing divalent cations. The adsorptive capacity of Windsor and Charlton soils for poliovirus 1 and coliphage f2 increased greatly with the soil sample depth until leveling off at the midcore depths. Soil suspended in wastewater had the least virus adsorption capability for all depths studied.

"Hantaviruses are distributed worldwide and are transmitted by rodents. In Europe, the infection usually manifests as a mild form of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) known as nephropathia epidemica (NE), which is triggered by the virus species Puumala. Its host is the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). In the context of climate change, interest in the role of climatic factors for the disease has increased. A systematic review was conducted to investigate the association between climate variability and the occurrence of human Puumala hantavirus infections in Europe. We performed a literature search in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science. Studies that investigated Puumala virus infection and climatic factors in any European country with a minimum collection period of 2 years were included. The selection of abstracts and the evaluation of included studies were performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 434 titles were identified in the databases, of which nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The majority of studies were conducted in central Europe (Belgium, France and Germany), while only two came from the north (Sweden) and one from the south (Bosnia). Strong evidence was found for a positive association between temperature and NE incidence in central Europe, while the evidence for northern Europe so far appears insufficient. Results regarding precipitation were contradictory. Overall, the complex relationships between climate and hantavirus infections need further exploration to identify specific health risks and initiate appropriate intervention measures in the context of climate change.

"The packaging of bacteriophage P1 DNA is initiated by cleavage of the viral DNA at a specific site, designated pac. The proteins necessary for that cleavage, and the genes that encode those proteins, are described in this report. By sequencing wild-type P1 DNA and DNA derived from various P1 amber mutants that are deficient in pac cleavage, two distinct genes, referred to as pacA and pacB, were identified. These genes appear to be coordinately transcribed with an upstream P1 gene that encodes a regulator of late P1 gene expression (gene 10). pacA is located upstream from pacB and contains the 161 base-pair pac cleavage site. The predicted sizes of the PacA and PacB proteins are 45 kDa and 56 kDa, respectively. These proteins have been identified on SDS-polyacrylamide gels using extracts derived from Escherichia coli cells that express these genes under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter. Extracts prepared from cells expressing both PacA and PacB are proficient for site-specific cleavage of the P1 packaging site, whereas those lacking either protein are not. However, the two defective extracts can complement each other to restore functional pac cleavage activity. Thus, PacA and PacB are two essential bacteriophage proteins required for recognition and cleavage of the P1 packaging site. PacB extracts also contain a second P1 protein that is encoded within the pacB gene. We have identified this protein on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and have shown that it is translated in the same reading frame as is PacB. Its role, if any, in pac cleavage is yet to be determined.

"Small rodents and insectivores have become the main reservoirs of tick-borne encephalitis virus. In order, therefore, to demonstrate the dynamic and structural changes occurring in a natural focus of tick-borne encephalitis, information has been collected on the distribution, habitat, life-cycle, population density and extent of tick infestation of the rodents and insectivores that inhabit the Tribec region and adjacent parts of the Hronský Inovec Mountains. The following mammals are discussed: Sciurus vulgaris, Citellus citellus, Glis glis, Muscardinus avellanarius, Mus musculus, Micromys minutus, Apodemus flavicollis, A. sylvaticus, Microtus arvalis, Pitymys subterraneus, Clethrionomys glareolus, Arvicola terrestris, Sorex araneus, S. minutus, Neomys fodiens, N. anomalus, Crocidura suaveolens, C. leucodon, Erinaceus roumanicus and Talpa europaea. Many of these are important reservoirs of virus.

"PURPOSE: We studied and developed a gene-based intraocular erythropoietin (EPO) therapy for diabetic retinopathy (DR), by which the applicability of neuroprotective therapy with favorable safety profile is attempted. METHODS: Hematocrit (Hct) was measured in C57BL/6 mice after intramuscular injection of AAV2-CMV-hEPO virus. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Subretinal or intravitreal injection was performed in SD rats and Dark Agouti (DA) rats. The human EPO (hEPO) concentration was measured with ELISA. Blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown was measured with Evans blue permeation. Retinal function was evaluated with electroretinography (ERG). Retinal cell apoptosis was detected with TUNEL. Retinal thickness and cell counts were examined by light microscopy. Retinal vascular changes were evaluated with fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and confocal microscopy. RESULTS: The serum hEPO was elevated 2 weeks after AAV2-CMV-hEPO virus injection, and Hct began to increase after 4 weeks. After subretinal injection, hEPO expressions in aqueous humor, vitreous, and retina followed a dose- and time-dependent manner. In the AAV2-CMV-hEPO-treated diabetic group, BRB was maintained, and retinal cell apoptosis was significantly reduced. The ERG results showed that the retinal function remained unchanged for at least one year after subretinal injection of AAV2-CMV-hEPO virus. Long-term expression of hEPO following subretinal injection of AAV2-CMV-hEPO virus did not induce neovascularization in retina and choroid. CONCLUSIONS: The AAV2-CMV-hEPO gene therapy is safe, and it exerts long-term protective effects on diabetic retinas. Thus, the gene therapy by using AAV2-CMV-hEPO for DR is feasible.

"Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus (VHSV) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) are important viral pathogens posing a serious threat to salmonid fish. Survival of two isolates of IHNV and one of VHSV was assessed at temperatures ranging from 4 to 25°C: (a) after drying on stainless steel, (b) in cell culture medium, (c) in filtered river water, (d) in unfiltered river water, and (e) survival, adsorption and desorption in river sediment and five typical soil types. The viruses survived 1 hr to > 84 days depending on the conditions. Survival was inversely related to temperature and organic and inorganic content. Both viruses remained infectious after being dried on stainless steel for several weeks highlighting the risk of mechanical transmission and persistence in a dry environment. Both adsorbed to the soils from the river water inoculum, with titres between 5.56x10(4) and 2.58x10(8) TCID(50) /ml after 1 hr. Clay soils adsorbed the least virus but had the greatest decrease in the river water inoculum (undetectable in ≤ 1 hr), and there was no desorption. Virus desorbed from the other soils into the surrounding water at different rates dependant on soil type (longest desorption was from chalk loam and sandy soil-detected at 28 days). When desorption was no longer detectable, virus persisted, adsorbed to the soil and remained infectious (the longest adsorption was detected in clay loam for ≥ 49 days, but all the viruses adsorbed to soils were likely to have survived longer than that detected, based on their rate of decay). The long survival of the viruses, particularly at cooler temperatures, highlights the risk of survival in the environment and waterborne spread. The data presented here are highly relevant for assessing risk of pathogen introduction via fomites (stainless steel) and for deciding on best control measures in the context of disease outbreaks.

"The use of HBV and HDV experimental models has significantly contributed to understand the viral life cycle and to systematically test antiviral effects of various drugs on a pre-clinical level. Similar replication strategies of related hepadna viruses permit the use of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), woodchucks (Marmota monax), ground and tree squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) or Pekin ducks (Anas domesticus) as appropriate animal models. Cell culture systems for in vitro infection or transfection using both primary cultures of human and non-human hepatocytes and non-hepatocytes and cell lines have recently been identified. The advantages and restrictions of these experimental models with respect to evaluation of interferon effects on viral and hepatocellular gene expression are discussed.

"H-2Kb mutant molecules (H-2Kbm) and the H-2Kb-restricted response to OVA and VSV N peptides were used to investigate the influence of polymorphism of structurally defined regions of the MHC class I molecules on intrathymic positive selection of the T-cell repertoire. We show that the positive selection of the T-cell repertoire in the thymus requires the self-peptide to be present in the MHC antigen-binding site. A correlation between the ability of four MHC molecules to present antigenic peptide and to positively select T cells specific for it was noted. The self-peptides involved in positive selection may therefore mimic the foreign peptide during intrathymic selection. A structural correlate of this mimicry may be a similar or identical binding requirement for the antigen-binding pocket(s)/residues of the MHC peptide-binding site.

"The YXDD motif is highly conserved in the reverse transcriptase family. The variable X residue is occupied by valine and methionine in MuLV RT and HIV-1 RT, respectively. Previous studies have shown that Tyr 222, the Y residue of the YXDD motif in MuLV RT, constitutes a major component of the fidelity center of the enzyme [Kaushik, N., Singh, K., Alluru, I., and Modak, M. J. (1999) Biochemistry 38, 2617-2627]. In this work, we present evidence that reverse transcriptases containing valine in the ""X"" position of the YXDD motif generally catalyze DNA synthesis with greater fidelity than those containing methionine or alanine. In the MuLV RT system, the two mutants V223M and V223A exhibited an overall reduced fidelity of DNA synthesis, specifically for RNA-templated reactions. Further analysis revealed that these mutants exhibit a higher efficiency of misinsertion on MS2 RNA than the wild-type enzyme for every mispair tested. However, unlike HIV-1 RT, the insensitivity of the wild-type MuLV RT to all four ddNTPs remained unchanged by mutation of V223 to Met or Ala. A 3D molecular model of the ternary complex of MuLV RT, template primer, and dNTP suggests that Val 223 along with its neighboring Tyr 222 stabilizes the substrate binding pocket via hydrophobic interactions with the dNTP substrate and template-primer.

"Hantavirus activity in 39 National Parks in the eastern and central United States was surveyed by testing 1,815 small mammals of 38 species for antibody reactive to Sin Nombre virus. Antibody-positive rodents were found throughout the area sampled, and in most biotic communities. Antibody was detected in 7% of 647 deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), 2% of 590 white-footed mice (P. leucopus), 17% of 12 rice rats (Oryzomys palustris), 3% of 31 cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus), and 33% of 18 western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis). Antibody was also found in three of six species of voles, and in one of 33 chipmunks (Tamias minimus). Prevalence among Peromyscus was highest in the northeast. Although few cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been identified from the eastern and central regions, widespread infection in reservoir populations indicates that potential exists for human infection throughout much of the United States.

"The monoclonal antibody 2F5 neutralizes a broad range of human immunodeficiency virus-1 isolates via a conserved epitope on the viral glycoprotein gp41. The conformation of the principal epitope is a type I beta-turn centered on gp41 residues (664)DKW(666); in addition, binding studies indicate that residues N- and C-terminal to this core as well as structurally more distant parts of gp41 also contribute to the interaction. Ab2/3H6 is an anti-idiotypic antibody that inhibits the interaction between 2F5 and gp41 and as such, Ab2/3H6 may, in principle, possess a paratope that mimics the gp41 epitope. To establish the potential of Ab2/3H6 to serve as a guide for the design of vaccine components against human immunodeficiency virus, we investigated the crystal structure of the heterodimeric complex of Ab2/3H6 F(ab) and 2F5 F(ab)'. Ab2/3H6 F(ab) binds to 2F5 F(ab)' via a helix-like protrusion formed by residues (58(H))RYSPSLNTRL(67(H)) of the 2F5 F(ab)' variable domain and proximal to but not overlapping with the gp41 (664)DKW(666) epitope-binding pocket. This defines Ab2/3H6 as an anti-idiotypic antibody of the Ab2gamma class, i.e., an antigen-inhibitable idiotype that does not carry the internal image of the linear primary gp41 (662)ELDKWAS(668) epitope.

"Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), a simple retrovirus, needs to export unspliced viral RNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, circumventing the host cell restriction on cytoplasmic expression of intron-containing RNA. The cytoplasmic accumulation of full-length viral RNA is promoted by two cis-acting direct repeat (DR) elements that flank the src gene; at least one copy of the DR sequence is necessary for viral replication. We show here that the DR mediates export of a reporter construct from the nucleus, suggesting it is a constitutive transport element (CTE). In contrast, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other complex retroviruses encode accessory proteins, Rev or Rex, which promote export of incompletely spliced viral transcripts. This RNA export pathway is CRM1 dependent and can be blocked by the cytotoxic agent leptomycin B. We show here that DR-mediated export is CRM1 independent, suggesting that RSV uses a different export pathway from that of HIV-1 and other complex retroviruses. The simian retroviruses have a CTE which interacts with the cellular Tap export protein. However, we were unable to detect binding of the RSV DR RNA to Tap, suggesting it may use a different export pathway from that of the simian retroviruses. These data suggest that the RSV DR element uses a novel nucleocytoplasmic export pathway.

"Transcription by RNA polymerase (pol) III is under cell-cycle control, being higher in S and G2 than in G0 and early G1 phases. Many transformed cell types have elevated pol III activity, presumably to sustain sufficient protein synthesis for unrestrained growth. The retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein (Rb) restricts cellular proliferation, and is often found mutated in transformed cells. Here we demonstrate that Rb can repress the level of transcription from pol III templates both in vitro and vivo. Analysis of Rb-deficient SAOS2 cells and primary fibroblasts from Rb-/- mice demonstrates elevated levels of pol III activity in the absence of functional Rb protein. Rb-induced repression of pol III activity is alleviated by mutations in the Rb pocket domain that occur naturally in tumours, and by viral transforming proteins that bind and inactivate Rb. These results implicate repression of pol III transcription as a mechanism for Rb-induced growth arrest, and suggest that restraining protein biosynthesis may be important in the prevention of tumour development.

"BACKGROUND: Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP) of supracondylar humeral fractures is one of the most common procedures performed in pediatric orthopaedics. The use of full, standard preparation and draping with standard personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be necessary during this procedure. This is of particular interest in the current climate as we face unprecedented PPE shortages due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of 1,270 patients treated with CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture at 2 metropolitan pediatric centers by 10 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. One surgeon in the group did not wear a mask when performing CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures, and multiple surgeons in the group utilized a semisterile preparation technique (no sterile gown or drapes). Infectious outcomes were compared between 2 groups: full sterile preparation and semisterile preparation. We additionally analyzed a subgroup of patients who had semisterile preparation without surgeon mask use. Hospital cost data were used to estimate annual cost savings with the adoption of the semisterile technique. RESULTS: In this study, 1,270 patients who underwent CRPP of a supracondylar humeral fracture and met inclusion criteria were identified. There were 3 deep infections (0.24%). These infections all occurred in the group using full sterile preparation and surgical masks. No clinically relevant pin-track infections were noted. There were no known surgeon occupational exposures to bodily fluid. It is estimated that national adoption of this technique in the United States could save between 18,612 and 22,162 gowns and masks with costs savings of $3.7 million to $4.4 million annually. CONCLUSIONS: We currently face critical shortages of PPE due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from this large series suggest that a semisterile technique during CRPP of supracondylar humeral fractures is a safe practice. We anticipate that this could preserve approximately 20,000 gowns and masks in the United States over the next year. Physicians are encouraged to reevaluate their daily practice to identify safe opportunities for resource preservation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

"The European rabbit was brought to Australia as a companion animal by early settlers. It sometimes escaped, but failed to survive in the Australian bush. In 1879 wild rabbits were deliberately sent to Victoria to provide game for wealthy settlers to shoot. They soon spread all over Australia, except in the tropics, and became Australia's major animal pest. After careful testing in Australian wildlife and in humans, control by myxoma virus was introduced at various sites between 1937 and 1950, spreading all over the Murray-Darling Basin in 1950. Within one year mutations in the virus had led to slightly less virulence, and these continued for the next 50 years. In the early 21st Century testing viruses obtained from wild rabbits showed that the majority of these viruses were more virulent than the virus used to initiate the epidemic. In 1995 another virus specific for European rabbits, rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus, escaped from areas in which field trials were being carried out and spread around Australia. It was more successful than myxomatosis for rabbit control in arid regions.

"OBJECTIVES: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends task-shifting HIV care to nurses in low-resource settings with limited numbers of physicians. However, the effect of such task-shifting on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of people living with HIV (PLHIV) has seldom been evaluated. We aimed to investigate the effect of task-shifting HIV care to nurses on HRQL outcomes in PLHIV initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) in rural district hospitals in Cameroon. METHODS: Outcomes in PLHIV were longitudinally collected in the 2006-2010 Stratall trial. PLHIV were followed up for 24 months by nurses and/or physicians. Six HRQL dimensions were assessed during face-to-face interviews using the WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-HIV BREF scale: physical health; psychological health; independence level; social relationships; environment; and spirituality/religion/personal beliefs. The degree of task-shifting was estimated using a consultant ratio (i.e. the ratio of nurse-led to physician-led visits). The effect of task-shifting and other potential correlates on HRQL dimensions was explored using a Heckman two-stage approach based on linear mixed models to adjust for the potential bias caused by missing data in the outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1424 visits in 440 PLHIV (70.5% female; median age 36 years; median CD4 count 188 cells/μL at enrolment), 423 (29.7%) were task-shifted to nurses. After multiple adjustment, task-shifting was associated with higher HRQL level for four dimensions: physical health [coefficient 0.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.1-1.2; P = 0.01], psychological health (coefficient 0.5; 95% CI 0.0-1.0; P = 0.05), independence level (coefficient 0.6; 95% CI 0.1-1.1; P = 0.01) and environment (coefficient 0.6; 95% CI 0.1-1.0; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Task-shifting HIV care to nurses benefits the HRQL of PLHIV. Together with the previously demonstrated comparable clinical effectiveness of physician-based and nurse-based models of HIV care, our results support the WHO recommendation for task-shifting.

"Aquaculture production is increasing rapidly worldwide. However, production has been associated with the emergence of several novel diseases, including viral diseases, that have caused serious problems for producers. Using examples largely from salmon farming in Scotland I review briefly the factors that allow transmission to occur in aquaculture. These include transmission through the water, which is relatively local to the infected farm, and anthropogenic transports (such as transport of fish between sites) that may occur over very long distances. A Disease Management Area (DMA) approach, as developed in Scotland to fight infectious salmon anaemia, can be effective at reducing pathogen transmission and hence disease emergence.

"The pandemic COVID-19 was caused by a novel Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that infects humans through the binding of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike 2 protein to the glycosylated ACE2 receptor. The spike 2 protein recognizes the N-terminal helices of the glycosylated metalloprotease domain in the human ACE2 receptor. To understand the susceptibility of animals for infection and transmission, we did sequence and structure-based molecular interaction analysis of 16 ACE2 receptors from different mammalian species with SARS-CoV-2 spike 2 receptor binding domain. Our comprehensive structure analysis revealed that the natural substitution of amino acid residues Gln24, His34, Phe40, Leu79 and Met82 in the N-terminal α1 and α2 helices of the ACE2 receptor results in loss of crucial network of hydrogen-bonded and hydrophobic interactions with receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Another striking observation is the absence of N-glycosylation site Asn103 in all mammals and many species, lack more than one N-linked glycosylation site in the ACE2 receptor. Based on the loss of crucial interactions and the absence of N-linked glycosylation sites we categorized Felis catus, Equus caballus, Panthera tigris altaica, as highly susceptible while Oryctolagus cuniculus, Bos Tauras, Ovis aries and Capra hircus as moderately susceptible species for infection. Similarly, the E. asinus, Bubalus bubalis, Canis lupus familiaris, Ailuropoda melaleuca and Camelus dromedarius are categorized as low susceptible with Loxodonta Africana, Mus musculus, Sus scrofa and Rattus rattus as least susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"Disaster responses often involve coordination among multiple levels of government and public and private sector collaboration. When emergencies raise health concerns, governments must include public health and health care systems in their response. A state government's declaration of ""public health emergency"" can provide that state's health sector with flexibility and guidance about response parameters. Although events including Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy and the H1N1 influenza outbreak provided opportunities for states to deploy their public health emergency powers, little has been reported about how states have used their authority to declare a public health emergency. I present a systematic identification and analysis of states' public health emergency declarations, examine why these declarations were issued, and discuss their potential value.

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a calicivirus that causes acute infections in both domestic and wild European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The virus causes significant economic losses in rabbit farming and reduces wild rabbit populations. The recent emergence of RHDV variants capable of overcoming immunity to other strains emphasises the need to develop universally effective antivirals to enable quick responses during outbreaks until new vaccines become available. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a primary target for the development of such antiviral drugs. In this study, we used cell-free in vitro assays to examine the biochemical characteristics of two rabbit calicivirus RdRps and the effects of several antivirals that were previously identified as human norovirus RdRp inhibitors. The non-nucleoside inhibitor NIC02 was identified as a potential scaffold for further drug development against rabbit caliciviruses. Our experiments revealed an unusually high temperature optimum (between 40 and 45 °C) for RdRps derived from both a pathogenic and a non-pathogenic rabbit calicivirus, possibly demonstrating an adaptation to a host with a physiological body temperature of more than 38 °C. Interestingly, the in vitro polymerase activity of the non-pathogenic calicivirus RdRp was at least two times higher than that of the RdRp of the highly virulent RHDV.

"Puumala hantavirus, transmitted by bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus), causes a mild-type hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The disease is common in Finland and is considered an occupational hazard for farmers, but the actual risk has not been assessed by analytical studies. Data on 5,132 serologically confirmed Puumala virus infections during 1989-1994 were analyzed, and cases among farmers and the population living in similar conditions were compared. The farmers contracted the disease earlier and more often than did the comparison group. In the province of Mikkeli with the highest incidence (70/100,000), the risk ratio was 5.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.0-8.4) for 20- to 29-year-old farmers; in the older age groups, the risk was still increased but the risk ratios were lower. The peak incidence in the comparison group was 10 years later (age group 30-39 years). For the whole country, the result was similar although less marked. The average risk ratio adjusted by age, sex, and geographic variation was 1.7 (95% CI 1.5-1.8) for the whole country and 1.9 (95% CI 1.5-2.3) for the Mikkeli province, where 80% of Puumala virus infections among young farmers could be estimated to be attributable to occupation.

"A method was developed for production of a freeze-dried Western equine encephalomyelitis vaccine from virus propagated in chick embryo cell culture monolayers maintained with a serum-free medium. A sufficient concentration of virus accumulated in the cell culture fluids prior to the occurrence of viral cytopathology to permit the production of a vaccine relatively free from serum and cellular proteins. Inoculation with two mouse ld(50) doses of virus per 100 tissue culture cells was found to yield reproducible high virus titers at a convenient harvest time. These harvests were inactivated at 22 C by 0.05% formalin within 48 hr. Potency test results, as measured by the protection of immunized guinea pigs against an intracerebral virus challenge, indicated that the vaccine produced from the virus propagated in cell culture was equal in potency to a lot of whole chick embryo vaccine used to immunize laboratory and field workers subject to a high risk of infection.

"Passage of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in BHK-21 cells resulted in the segmentation of the viral genome into two defective RNAs lacking part of either the L- or the capsid-coding region. The two RNAs are infectious by complementation. Electroporation of L-defective RNA in BHK-21 cells resulted in the accumulation of the precursor P3 located away from the deleted sequence. Expression of L in trans led to the processing of P3, indicating that there is a connection between L protease activity and the secondary cleavages carried out by 3C protease within P3. These results suggest that the complementation mechanism between defective RNAs is not restricted to supplying the L and capsid proteins but that distance effects on polyprotein processing events are also implicated.

"This work analyses the genetic variation and evolutionary patterns of recessive resistance loci involved in matching-allele (MA) host-pathogen interactions, focusing on the pvr2 resistance gene to potyviruses of the wild pepper Capsicum annuum glabriusculum (chiltepin). Chiltepin grows in a variety of wild habitats in Mexico, and its cultivation in home gardens started about 25 years ago. Potyvirus infection of Capsicum plants requires the physical interaction of the viral VPg with the pvr2 product, the translation initiation factor eIF4E1. Mutations impairing this interaction result in resistance, according to the MA model. The diversity of pvr2/eIF4E1 in wild and cultivated chiltepin populations from six biogeographical provinces in Mexico was analysed in 109 full-length coding sequences from 97 plants. Eleven alleles were found, and their interaction with potyvirus VPg in yeast-two-hybrid assays, plus infection assays of plants, identified six resistance alleles. Mapping resistance mutations on a pvr2/eIF4E1 model structure showed that most were around the cap-binding pocket and strongly altered its surface electrostatic potential, suggesting resistance-associated costs due to functional constraints. The pvr2/eIF4E1 phylogeny established that susceptibility was ancestral and resistance was derived. The spatial structure of pvr2/eIF4E1 diversity differed from that of neutral markers, but no evidence of selection for resistance was found in wild populations. In contrast, the resistance alleles were much more frequent, and positive selection stronger, in cultivated chiltepin populations, where diversification of pvr2/eIF4E1 was higher. This analysis of the genetic variation of a recessive resistance gene involved in MA host-pathogen interactions in populations of a wild plant show that evolutionary patterns differ according to the plant habitat, wild or cultivated. It also demonstrates that human management of the plant population has profound effects on the diversity and the evolution of the resistance gene, resulting in the selection of resistance alleles.

"We have identified two cellular proteins that are specifically immunoprecipitated by an anti-SV40 T antigen monoclonal antibody. This antibody, PAb419, recognizes an epitope contained within a region of T antigen which we have recently demonstrated is required for the initiation of immortalization by SV40 T antigen, but is not essential for maintenance of the immortal state. The two proteins were identified as BAP37 and Prohibitin. Recent results suggest Prohibitin may enhance the transcriptional inactivation of E2F by the retinoblastoma family of pocket proteins (pRb, p107, p130). BAP37 and Prohibitin are specifically recognized by PAb419 and PAb210, another anti-SV40 T antigen monoclonal antibody, which has an overlapping epitope, but not by other anti-SV40 T antigen monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating the specificity of the interaction.

"Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) can develop systemic cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Combination of pegylated-interferon α and ribavirin is the first-line treatment of this condition. However, in case of severe or life-threatening manifestations, absence of a virological response, or autonomized vasculitis, immunotherapy (alone or in addition to the antiviral regimen) is necessary. Rituximab is to date the only biologic with a sufficient level of evidence to support its use in this indication. Several studies have demonstrated that rituximab is highly effective when cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis is refractory to antiviral regimen, that association of rituximab with antiviral regimen may induce a better and faster clinical remission, and, recently, that rituximab is more efficient than traditional immunosuppressive treatments. Some issues with regard to the optimal dose of rituximab or its use as maintenance treatment remain unsolved. Interestingly, in balance with this anti-inflammatory strategy, a recent pilot study reported the significant expansion of circulating regulatory T lymphocytes with concomitant clinical improvement in patients with refractory HCV-induced cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis using low dose of subcutaneous interleukin-2. This paper provides an updated overview on the place of immunotherapy, especially biologics, in the management of HCV-induced cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis.

"In mammalian cells, the rabbit beta-globin readthrough protein is the only known example of a naturally occurring readthrough protein which does not involve a viral system. To provide an efficient means for its isolation, detection, and study, we elicited specific antibodies against this unique protein. The 22 amino acid peptide corresponding to the readthrough portion of this protein was synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected into sheep. Specific antibodies to the peptide were produced as demonstrated by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique and by immunoblotting. The antibodies did not react with globin. The rabbit beta-globin readthrough protein was separated from globin and other reticulocyte proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining or by labeling with [35S]methionine. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into the readthrough protein was significantly enhanced upon addition of an opal suppressor tRNA to reticulocyte lysates. Immunoblotting revealed that the readthrough protein also occurs in lysates without added suppressor tRNA. The antibodies were purified on an affi-gel column which had been coupled with the peptide antigen. The readthrough protein was then purified from reticulocytes by immunoaffinity chromatography and by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results provide conclusive evidence that the beta-globin readthrough protein is naturally occurring in rabbit reticulocytes.

"Amyloid fibrils have been classically defined as linear, nonbranched polymeric proteins with a cross beta-sheet structure and the ability to alter the optical properties of the amyloid-specific dye Congo Red. Mounting evidence suggests that soluble oligomeric peptide assemblies approximately 2-20 nm in diameter are critical intermediates in amyloid formation. Using a pathogenic prion protein peptide comprised of residues 23-144, we demonstrate that, under quiescent but not agitated conditions, much larger globular assemblies up to 1 mum in diameter are made. These globules precede fibril formation and directly interact with growing fibril bundles. Fibrils made via these large spherical peptide assemblies displayed a remarkable diversity of ultrastructural features. Fibrillization of the Abeta1-40 peptide under similar conditions yielded similar results, suggesting a mechanism of general amyloid formation that can proceed through intermediates much larger than those previously described. Our data suggest that simply changing the physical microenvironment can profoundly influence the mechanism of amyloid formation and yield fibrils with novel ultrastructural properties.

"Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiate to adipocytes in the presence of insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine (IDI). A transient increase of DNA synthesis is induced in 3T3-L1 cells 18 h after addition of IDI, followed by an arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Growth arrested cells express the proto-oncogene c-myc and the gene for the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBPalpha) between day 2 and 5. While c-Myc is strongly implicated in cell proliferation, C/EBPalpha: is a differentiation-specific transcription factor with antiproliferative activity. Here we have characterized the cell cycle arrest in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Arrested cells express the Cdk inhibitors p21 and p27, but, at the same time, show hyperphosphorylation of Rb and expression of the E2F-regulated thymidine kinase gene. The addition of new serum to arrested cells resulted in cyclin A expression and Cdk2 activity, but not in DNA synthesis. Simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (LTAg) is a potent mitogen. The mutant LTAg-K1, deficient in binding of pocket proteins and unable to induce DNA synthesis in serum-starved 3T3-L1 cells, efficiently induced DNA synthesis in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. This indicates that pocket proteins are probably not involved in the control of the cell cycle arrest during 3T3-L1 cell differentiation. Our data suggest that the differentiation-specific cell cycle block in 3T3-L1 cells is resistant to high levels of c-Myc, inactivation of pocket proteins, upregulation of cyclin A levels, and Cdk2 activation, but can be abolished by a function of LTAg that is independent of binding to pocket proteins.

"Between 1974 and 1980, 424 viruses were isolated at the Long Pocket Laboratories of the Division of Animal Health, CSIRO, either from insects or from the blood of sentinel cattle, and of these, 165 cross-reacted with D'Aguilar virus (an Australian Palyam group virus) in a complement fixation test. Neutralization tests were used to classify these viruses into four serotypes with the isolates D'Aguilar B8112, CSIRO 11, CSIRO 58 and CSIRO 82 as the type strains. The latter three were new to Australia. Like other orbiviruses, these four serotypes were partially sensitive to treatment with either or chloroform. Neutralizing antibodies against D'Aguilar, CSIRO 11 and CSIRO 58 viruses were detected in sera from cattle, buffalo, deer and sheep but not in sera from humans, horses, pigs or marsupials. Antibodies against CSIRO 82 virus were detected in 85% of 26 buffalo, and 0.4% of 495 cattle sera tested. The antibody distribution in Australia for D'Aguilar, CSIRO 11 and CSIRO 58 viruses fell within the distribution limits of Culicoides brevitarsis, the insect from which these viruses were most commonly recovered. The antibody distribution for CSIRO 82 virus, which was isolated from a pool containing C. schultzei and C. peregrinus, fell within the much more restricted distribution limits of these species. None of these viruses has been associated with disease.

"Despite significant implications of viral activity in sediment ecosystems, there are limited data describing how sediment viral assemblages respond to broader ecosystem changes. To document this, the spatial and temporal dynamics of viral and bacterial abundance (BA) and changes in the morphological distribution of viruses were examined within three salinity regions over 2 years. Viral abundances (VA) ranged from 0.2 to 17 × 10(10) viruses mL(-1) sediment while direct bacterial counts ranged from 3.8 to 37 × 10(8) cells mL(-1) sediment. Peaks and valleys in the abundance of extracted viruses and bacteria from surface sediments occurred simultaneously, with lows in February 2004 and highs in April 2003. Across all samples, viral and BA were positively correlated (P < 0.001). Vertical profiles showed a decrease in viral and BA with depth in sediments. Based on transmission electron microscopy results, viruses with diminutive capsids (20-50 nm) and from the Myoviridae and Podoviridae viral family types were dominant within surface sediments. The most morphologically diverse viral assemblages occurred in autumn samples from the sandy, polyhaline station and spring samples from the mesohaline station. Seasonal changes showed an average 72% decrease in VA from spring to winter. These observations support the view that viriobenthos assemblages are responsive to seasonal environmental changes and that viral processes have significant implications for the biogeochemical processes mediated by bacterial communities within Bay sediments.

"BACKGROUND: Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is an antigen-independent, innate immune response to arterial occlusion and ischemia with subsequent paradoxical exacerbation after reperfusion. IRI remains a critical problem after vessel occlusion and infarction or during harvest and surgery in transplants. After transplant, liver IRI (LIRI) contributes to increased acute and chronic rejection and graft loss. Tissue loss during LIRI has been attributed to local macrophage activation and invasion with excessive inflammation together with hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis. Inflammatory and apoptotic signaling are key targets for reducing post-ischemic liver injury.Myxomavirus is a rabbit-specific leporipoxvirus that encodes a suite of immune suppressing proteins, often with extensive function in other mammalian species. Serp-2 is a cross-class serine protease inhibitor (serpin) which inhibits the inflammasome effector protease caspase-1 as well as the apoptotic proteases granzyme B and caspases 8 and 10. In prior work, Serp-2 reduced inflammatory cell invasion after angioplasty injury and after aortic transplantation in rodents. In this report, we explore the potential for therapeutic treatment with Serp-2 in a mouse model of LIRI. METHODS: Wildtype (C57BL/6 J) mice were subjected to warm, partial (70%) hepatic ischemia for 90 min followed by treatment with saline or Serp-2 or M-T7, 100 ng/g/day given by intraperitoneal injection on alternate days for 5 days. M-T7 is a Myxomavirus-derived inhibitor of chemokine-GAG interactions and was used in this study for comparative analysis of an unrelated viral protein with an alternative immunomodulating mechanism of action. Survival, serum ALT levels and histopathology were assessed 24 h and 10 days post-LIRI. RESULTS: Serp-2 treatment significantly improved survival to 85.7% percent versus saline-treated wildtype mice (p = 0.0135), while M-T7 treatment did not significantly improve survival (p = 0.2584). Liver viability was preserved by Serp-2 treatment with a significant reduction in serum ALT levels (p = 0.0343) and infarct scar thickness (p = 0.0016), but with no significant improvement with M-T7 treatment. Suzuki scoring by pathologists blinded with respect to treatment group indicated that Serp-2 significantly reduced hepatocyte necrosis (p = 0.0057) and improved overall pathology score (p = 0.0046) compared to saline. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Serp-2 treatment reduced macrophage infiltration into the infarcted liver tissue (p = 0.0197). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with Serp-2, a virus-derived inflammasome and apoptotic pathway inhibitor, improves survival after liver ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse models. Treatment with a cross-class immune modulator provides a promising new approach designed to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, improving survival and reducing chronic transplant damage.

"Setting: Zimbabwe has a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) driven tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, with antiretroviral therapy (ART) scaled up in the public sector since 2004. Objective: To determine whether national ART scale-up was associated with annual national TB case notification rates (CNR), stratified by disease type and category, between 2000 and 2013. Design: This was a retrospective study using aggregate data from global reports. Results: The number of people living with HIV and retained on ART from 2004 to 2013 increased from 8400 to 665 299, with ART coverage increasing from <0.5% to 48%. TB CNRs, all types and categories, increased from 2000 to 2003, and declined thereafter from 2004 to 2013. The decreases in annual TB notifications between the highest rates (before 2004) and lowest rates (2013) were all forms of TB (56%), new TB (60%), previously treated TB (53%), new smear-positive pulmonary TB (PTB) (40%), new smear-negative/smear-unknown PTB (58%) and extra-pulmonary TB (58%). Conclusion: Significant declines in TB CNRs were observed during ART scale-up, especially for smear-negative PTB and extra-pulmonary TB. These encouraging national trends support the continued scale-up of ART for people living with HIV as a way of tackling the twin epidemics of HIV/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome and TB in Zimbabwe.

"The goal of this project was to better define the relationship between the endoribonuclease activity of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) Nsp15 (mNsp15) and its role in virus infection. Molecular modeling demonstrated that the catalytic residues of mNsp15 are superimposable with its severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus ortholog. Alanine substitutions at three key residues in the mNsp15 catalytic pocket (H262, H277, and G275) and a double-mutant version (H262P and H277A) generated proteins with greatly reduced but detectable endoribonuclease activities. Furthermore, these mutant proteins demonstrated lower cleavage specificities for uridylate than wild-type (WT) mNsp15. These mutations were successfully incorporated into viruses named vH262A, vH277A, vG275A, and vH262P+H277A. All four mutant viruses formed plaques with diameters similar to that of MHV-A59 1000 (WT virus) on several different cell lines. Interestingly, viruses with a mutation at a noncatalytic residue, D324A, could not be recovered despite repeated attempts, and expression of mNsp15 containing the D324A mutation in Escherichia coli resulted in an insoluble protein. Plaques derived from vH262A produced approximately 6- to 13-fold fewer PFU than those from WT virus. Cells infected with mNsp15 mutant viruses accumulated lesser amounts of plus- and minus-sense subgenomic RNAs and spike protein than WT virus. The expression of mNsp15 in trans by transient transfection partially restored RNA synthesis by vH262A. These results demonstrate that mNsp15 is required for optimal infection by MHV.

"New materials are presented on the presence of the foci of anthropozoonozes in the Extreme North. For the first time there was established the existence in the subarctic tundra of the Taimyr peninsula of the arbovirus foci of the tick-borne encephalitis complex. A virus of the tick-borne encephalitis complex was isolated in 1973 from the gamasida ticks Haemogamasus ambulans Thorel. and Hirstionyssus isabellinus Oudms. and the nests of the Siberian lemming Lemmus lemmus L. This pointed to the existence in the Transpolar region of the foci or arboviruses in the nest-hole biocenoses of the lemmings outside the bird colonies. Cultures of tularemia bacilli (which proved the etiology of the epizootic among the lemmings observed in 1973 and also the presence of the lemming natural foci of tularemia and their combination with the arbovirus foci) were isolated from the lemmings at the same territory. The results of serological examination of the local population and of the animals pointed to the circulation in the Transpolar region of the causative agents of leptospirosis, toxoplasmosis, Q-fever and of the Asian tick-borne rickettsiosis.

"Emergency medicine physicians are uniquely positioned to detect manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease in the head and neck region. Awareness of the myriad of opportunistic infections and malignancies that involve the head, neck, and eyes is paramount to their diagnosis and treatment. On occasion some of these manifestations are a direct result of HIV and represent the initial signs of primary HIV infection. In some cases, prompt diagnosis and therapy will lead to preservation of function and prevention of significant morbidity.

"In order to investigate the role of residues inside and outside the peptide binding cleft of the Ld molecule in peptide presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), we constructed a series of point mutations in the Ld gene. We determined the effects of the mutations in the Ld molecule on the binding and recognition of an Ld-restricted CTL epitope derived from the nucleoprotein (NP) of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Each of the mutations within the Ld peptide binding cleft resulted in a complete loss of CTL recognition. Addition of the LCMV NP peptide to cells expressing these mutants did not increase surface Ld expression, suggesting that the mutations altered peptide binding. Mutations involving pockets D and E within the cleft affected LCMV peptide binding and recognition as drastically as those in pocket B, which was predicted to interact with a main anchor residue of the peptide. In striking contrast, the mutations located outside the cleft did not change either recognition or binding. These results demonstrate that the Ld residues in the peptide binding cleft are the main determinants dictating LCMV NP peptide binding, and that the residues in each of the pockets within the cleft play a role in this interaction. Surprisingly, one mutation outside the peptide binding cleft, T92S, abrogated CTL lysis of target cells treated with the LCMV NP peptide, but not virus-infected cells. These data show that this mutation selectively altered the presentation of the LCMV NP peptide introduced to the cell exogenously, but not endogenously. This implies that the pathway by which peptides associate with class I molecules within the cell differs from that of exogenous peptide binding.

"H1N1 is known to induce fulminant courses in youths and young adults. We report the case of a 24-year gravida 4 para 2 with singleton pregnancy admitted to obstetrical unit for fever up to 38°C during the 20th week of a so far uncomplicated pregnancy. Ultrasound examination and urine test was inconspicuous. Throat complaints were initially relieved during antibiotic therapy, but the patient developed dyspnea with progressing signs of cyanosis. Intubation was necessary on the fifth day because of decreasing oxygen saturation. Coincidentally, progressive pancytopenia and increased inflammatory activity was recorded. Echocardiography, blood cultures, and bronchial lavage brought no pathological findings, but CT revealed acute respiratory distress syndrome and hepatomegaly. Recent human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalic virus, herpes simplex virus, classical influenza and parainfluenza infections were excluded. An H1N1-infection was confirmed by PCR on the sixth day. The antiviral therapy was changed from zanamivir to oseltamivir. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was necessary due to insufficient oxygen saturation by mechanical ventilation. Until this time, pregnancy seemed to be unimpaired, but a sudden spontaneous expulsion of the fetus occurred on the seventh day (weight 460 g, no anomalies detectable). Curettage post abortem was not necessary. As a result of the antiviral therapy, H1N1-DNA was not detectable at day 16. Despite all endeavors, the respiratory situation could not be improved significantly; the patient additionally developed multiorgan failure during the time course and died on the 28th day of treatment. The recent case illustrates a very dangerous and imposing course of an H1N1-infection during pregnancy.

"The nucleotide sequence of a 2549-bp DNA fragment containing the entire coding region of the marmoset herpesvirus (MarHV) thymidine kinase gene (tk) and the flanking sequences was determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. The MarHV thymidine kinase polypeptide predicted from the nucleotide sequence contained 376 amino acids and had a molecular weight of 41,281. The sequencing data also reveal that the coding portion of another MarHV gene probably begins only 292 nucleotides downstream from the stop codon of the MarHV tk gene. There was relatively little nucleotide sequence homology between the MarHV tk gene and that of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 tk genes. Comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequences of the MarHV thymidine kinase polypeptide with that of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 thymidine kinase polypeptides, however, revealed clear, but interrupted, homology within several regions of the polypeptide chains. Amino acid sequence homology was particularly striking at residues 10 to 27 of the MarHV thymidine kinase polypeptide and residues 49 to 66 of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 thymidine kinase polypeptides. These same amino acid residues exhibit noticeable sequence homology to the mitochondrial beta subunit ATPase, oncogene p21 protein, adenylate kinase, and to other nucleotide-binding proteins. It has been proposed that the indicated regions of homology are elements of a nucleotide-binding pocket in ATPase, p21, and adenylate kinase, raising the possibility that amino acid residues 15 to 25 of the MarHV thymidine kinase and 54 to 64 of the HSV-1 and HSV-2 enzymes are likewise parts of nucleotide-binding sites.

"OBJECTIVES: To study the association between CD4/CD8 ratio and morbidity in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: The APROCO/COPILOTE cohort enrolled patients initiating a protease inhibitor-containing ART in 1997-1999. The association between occurrence of first non AIDS-defining severe events (NADE) and time-dependent measures of immune restoration was assessed by 4 Cox models with different definitions of restoration, CD4+ cell counts (CD4), CD4/CD8 ratio, both CD4 and CD4/CD8 ratio, or a composite variable (CD4< 500/mm3, CD4 > 500/mm3 and CD4/CD8 ratio < 1, CD4 > 500/mm3 and CD4/CD8 ratio > 1). Models adjusted on baseline characteristics and time-dependent viral load were compared using Akaike Information Criterion. RESULTS: We included 1227 patients. Median duration of follow-up was 9.2 years (IQR: 4.2-11.4). Median CD4 was 530/mm3 at 9 years. Median CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.3 (IQR: 0.2-0.5) at baseline and 0.6 (IQR: 0.4-0.9) after 9 years. Incidence of first NADE was 7.4/100 person-years, the most common being bacterial infections (21%), cardiovascular events (14%) and cancers (10%). For both bacterial infections and cardiovascular events, the CD4/CD8 ratio did not add predictive information to the CD4 cell count. However, low CD4/CD8 ratio was the best predictor of non-AIDS cancers (adjusted HR = 2.13 for CD4/CD8 < 0.5; 95% CI = 1.32-3.44). CONCLUSIONS: CD4/CD8 ratio remains < 1 in most HIV-infected patients despite long-term CD4+ cell counts restoration on ART. A CD4/CD8 ratio < 0.5 could identify patients who require a more intensive strategy of cancer prevention or screening.

"The genus Coronavirus contains about 25 species of coronaviruses (CoVs), which are important pathogens causing highly prevalent diseases and often severe or fatal in humans and animals. No licensed specific drugs are available to prevent their infection. Different host receptors for cellular entry, poorly conserved structural proteins (antigens), and the high mutation and recombination rates of CoVs pose a significant problem in the development of wide-spectrum anti-CoV drugs and vaccines. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s), which are key enzymes in viral gene expression and replication, were revealed to share a highly conservative substrate-recognition pocket by comparison of four crystal structures and a homology model representing all three genetic clusters of the genus Coronavirus. This conclusion was further supported by enzyme activity assays. Mechanism-based irreversible inhibitors were designed, based on this conserved structural region, and a uniform inhibition mechanism was elucidated from the structures of Mpro-inhibitor complexes from severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. A structure-assisted optimization program has yielded compounds with fast in vitro inactivation of multiple CoV M(pro)s, potent antiviral activity, and extremely low cellular toxicity in cell-based assays. Further modification could rapidly lead to the discovery of a single agent with clinical potential against existing and possible future emerging CoV-related diseases.

"Myxoma virus (MYXV) gained importance throughout the twentieth century because of the use of the highly virulent Standard Laboratory Strain (SLS) by the Australian government in the attempt to control the feral Australian population of Oryctolagus cuniculus (European rabbit) and the subsequent illegal release of MYXV in Europe. In the European rabbit, MYXV causes a disease with an exceedingly high mortality rate, named myxomatosis, which is passively transmitted by biting arthropod vectors. MYXV still has a great impact on European rabbit populations around the world. In contrast, only a single cutaneous lesion, restricted to the point of inoculation, is seen in its natural long-term host, the South-American Sylvilagus brasiliensis and the North-American S. Bachmani. Apart from being detrimental for European rabbits, however, MYXV has also become of interest in human medicine in the last two decades for two reasons. Firstly, due to the strong immune suppressing effects of certain MYXV proteins, several secreted virus-encoded immunomodulators (e.g. Serp-1) are being developed to treat systemic inflammatory syndromes such as cardiovascular disease in humans. Secondly, due to the inherent ability of MYXV to infect a broad spectrum of human cancer cells, the live virus is also being developed as an oncolytic virotherapeutic to treat human cancer. In this review, an update will be given on the current status of MYXV in rabbits as well as its potential in human medicine in the twenty-first century.

"Potent anti-retroviral therapy has transformed HIV-1 infection into a chronic manageable disease; however, drug resistance remains a common problem that limits the effectiveness and clinical benefits of this type of treatment. The discovery of viral reservoirs in the body, in which HIV-1 may persist, has helped to explain why therapeutic eradication of HIV-1 has proved so difficult. In the current study, we utilized a combination of structure-based analysis of cyclin/CDK complexes with our previously published Tat peptide derivatives. We modeled the Tat peptide inhibitors with CDKs and found a particular pocket that showed the most stable binding site (Cavity 1) using in silico analysis. Furthermore, we were able to find peptide mimetics that bound to similar regions using in silico searches of a chemical library, followed by cell-based biological assays. Using these methods, we obtained the first-generation mimetic drugs and tested these compounds on HIV-1 long terminal repeat-activated transcription. Using biological assays followed by similar in silico analysis to find second-generation drugs resembling the original mimetic, we found the new targets of Cavity 1 and Cavity 2 regions on CDK9. We examined the second-generation mimetic against various viral isolates and observed a generalized suppression of most HIV-1 isolates. Finally, the drug inhibited viral replication in humanized mouse models of Rag2(-/-)γc(-/-) with no toxicity to the animals at tested concentrations. Our results suggest that it may be possible to model peptide inhibitors into available crystal structures and further find drug mimetics using in silico analysis.

"We collected blood-fed, snow-melt mosquitoes (Culicidae: Culiseta and Aedes) to describe the feeding patterns of potential mosquito vectors of Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV, Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus). JCV is an arthropod-borne, zoonotic virus with deer as the primary amplifying host in western alpine ecosystems. We collected mosquitoes from natural resting areas, fiber pots, and carbon-dioxide baited miniature light traps in the Colorado Rocky Mountains in 2007. We conducted two polymerase chain reactions to amplify and sequence vertebrate DNA extracted from blood-fed mosquitoes, which yielded comparable, but not identical, results. Mammal-specific primers found mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis) as the source of all bloodmeals. To determine if unamplified bloodmeals were from nonmammalian sources, we screened all samples with conserved vertebrate primers, which confirmed the initial polymerase chain reaction results, but also found porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) and human (Homo sapiens) as additional bloodmeal sources. We consistently found that mule deer were the primary hosts for mosquitoes in this system. These results suggest that snow-melt mosquitoes, in particular A. cataphylla, may be important vectors in western JCV alpine systems and may also act as a bridge vector for JCV from cervid virus reservoirs to humans.

"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) overexpress various cell-surface tyrosine kinase receptors, including the type I high-affinity fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR-1). The purpose of this study was to determine whether FGFR-targeted gene therapy is feasible in this disorder. Accordingly, the effects of a conjugate consisting of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 linked to a Fab' fragment against the adenovirus knob region were evaluated in human pancreatic cancer cell lines treated with an adenoviral vector containing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (AdTK) gene. An adenoviral vector containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene (AdLuc) served to assess infection efficiency, and was initially tested in L6 rat myoblasts. In parental L6 cells that express exceedingly low levels of high-affinity FGFRs, transduction with AdLuc was enhanced 7- to 10-fold with the FGF2-Fab' conjugate, whereas in L6 cells transfected to express FGFR-1, it was enhanced 39- to 52-fold. The pancreatic cancer cell lines expressed variable levels of the four high-affinity FGF receptors, and exhibited 2- to 34-fold increases in gene transduction in the presence of the FGF2-Fab' conjugate. In the absence of FGF2-Fab' there was no correlation between surface binding of FGF2 and AdLuc transduction efficiency, whereas in the presence of FGF2-Fab', enhanced AdLuc transduction efficiency correlated with greater surface binding of FGF2. In the absence of AdTK, all the cell lines were insensitive to ganciclovir, whereas after AdTK transduction, only ASPC-1 and PANC-1 cells were resistant to ganciclovir even in the presence of FGF2-Fab'. Ganciclovir-mediated inhibition was dependent on the conjugate in CAPAN-1 and COLO-357 cells, but was independent of the conjugate in T3M4 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells. Real-time quantitative PCR of laser-captured cancer cells revealed high levels of various FGFR mRNA species in six of seven PDAC tumor samples. These findings indicate that transduction efficiency with FGF2-Fab' in pancreatic cancer cells is independent of native adenoviral transduction efficiency and is greatest in cells that exhibit concomitant expression of various high-affinity FGFRs. In view of the overexpression of high-affinity FGFRs in the cancer cells in PDAC, our findings also suggest that the combined use of AdTK, ganciclovir, and FGF2-Fab' may ultimately be a promising therapeutic approach in a subgroup of patients with PDAC.

"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Despite cannabis use being very common in patients co-infected with HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), its effect on these patients' immune systems remains undocumented. Documenting the potential effect of cannabis use on HIV immunological markers would help caregivers make more targeted health recommendations to co-infected patients. We performed a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between cannabis use and peripheral blood CD4 T-cell measures in co-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. DESIGN AND METHODS: Cannabis use was assessed using annual self-administered questionnaires in 955 patients (2386 visits) enrolled in the ANRS CO13-HEPAVIH cohort. The effect of cannabis use on circulating CD4 T-cell count and percentage was estimated using multivariate linear regression models with generalised estimating equations. Sensitivity analyses were conducted after excluding visits where (i) tobacco use and (ii) smoking >=10 tobacco cigarettes/day were reported. RESULTS: At the first visit, 48% of patients reported cannabis use during the previous four weeks, and 58% of these patients also smoked ≥10 tobacco cigarettes/day. After multiple adjustment, cannabis use was not significantly associated with either circulating CD4 T-cell count [model coefficient (95% confidence interval): 0.27 (-0.07; 0.62), P = 0.12] or percentage [-0.04 (-0.45; 0.36), P = 0.83]. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings show no evidence for a negative effect of cannabis use on circulating CD4 T-cell counts/percentages in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. In-depth immunological studies are needed to document whether cannabis has a harmful effect on CD4 levels in lungs and on cells' functional properties.

"The threshold for systemic viral infection relies on the amplification of virus at a primary infection site. We have identified that class I MHC molecules can trigger the inhibition of replication of Sindbis virus in a haplotype- and allele-specific manner. Class I MHC molecules of H-2d haplotypes exhibit a strong inhibitory effect whereas H-2k haplotypes show minimal inhibition of Sindbis viral replication. By a single gene transfection of H-2d class I MHC molecules, into cells that express class I MHC molecules of H-2k haplotype and are susceptible to viral replication, these cells became resistant to viral replication. The inhibition of viral replication by class I MHC molecules occurs neither during the stage of virus entry/endocytosis nor during virus maturation. Rather, viral-specific RNA replication, as well as viral gene expression, are inhibited in cells expressing inhibitory class I MHC molecules. This class I MHC molecule-mediated inhibition requires newly synthesized host gene products, implying the activation of an intracellular signaling mechanism that is triggered by specific class I MHC molecules.

"Murine myeloma and Chinese hamster ovary cells are used widely in the manufacture of recombinant proteins for biopharmaceuticals. However, rodent cell lines express endogenous retrovirus, which necessitates appropriate design of purification processes to remove virus in excess of the calculated maximum retroviral load. Currently, electron microscopy is the method of choice for determination of retroviral titre in bulk harvest. In this study we compared three electron microscopy techniques to determine retroviral titre in bulk harvest. These were direct negative stain, negative stain after sucrose-density purification and thin section electron microscopy of pelleted supernatant. The study demonstrated that the level of C-type retrovirus associated with cells was predictive of the viral load in cell culture supernatants. The most accurate method for quantifying viral load was direct counting, followed by thin section of pelleted supernatant and negative stain after sucrose concentration. The most practical method was thin section of resuspended pelleted supernatant, which gave improved detection limits.

"Since the early 1980s, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has been threatened by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD). The disease is caused by a lagovirus of the family Caliciviridae, the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV). The need for detection, identification and further characterization of RHDV led to the development of several diagnostic tests. Owing to the lack of an appropriate cell culture system for in vitro propagation of the virus, much of the methods involved in these tests contributed to our current knowledge on RHD and RHDV and to the development of vaccines to contain the disease. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the RHDV diagnostic tests used since the first RHD outbreak and that include molecular, histological and serological techniques, ranging from simpler tests initially used, such as the hemagglutination test, to the more recent and sophisticated high-throughput sequencing, along with an overview of their potential and their limitations.

"PURPOSE: The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) U(S)1 gene encodes host-range and ocular virulence determinants. Mutations in U(S)1 affecting virulence are known in strain OD4, but the genomic variation across several strains is not known. The goal was to determine the degree of sequence variation in the gene from several ocular HSV isolates. METHODS: The U(S)1 gene from six ocular HSV-1 isolates, as well as strains KOS and F, were sequenced, and bioinformatics analyses were applied to the data. RESULTS: Strains 17, F, CJ394, and CJ311 had identical amino acid sequences. With the other strains, most of the variability was concentrated in the amino-terminal third of the protein. MEME analysis identified a 63-residue core sequence (motif 1) present in all α-herpesvirus U(S)1 homologs that were located in a region identified as structured. Ten amino acids were absolutely conserved in all the α-herpesvirus U(S)1 homologs and were all located in the central core. Consensus-binding motifs for cyclin-dependent kinases and pocket proteins were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that significant sequence variation exists in the U(S)1 gene, that the α22 protein contains a conserved central core region with structurally variable regions at the amino- and carboxyl termini, that 10 amino acids are conserved in α-herpes U(S)1 homologs, and that additional host proteins may interact with the HSV-1 U(S)1 and U(S)1.5 proteins. This information will be valuable in designing further studies on structure-function relationships and on the role these play in host-range determination and keratitis.

"The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 is the pathogenetic agent of Corona Virus Induced Disease (COVID)19. The virus enters the human cells after binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 receptor in target tissues. ACE2 expression is induced in response to inflammation. The colon expression of ACE2 is upregulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), highlighting a potential risk of intestinal inflammation in promoting viral entry in the human body. Because mechanisms that regulate ACE2 expression in the intestine are poorly understood and there is a need of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, we have settled to investigate whether natural flavonoids might regulate the expression of Ace2 in intestinal models of inflammation. The results of these studies demonstrated that pelargonidin activates the Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) in vitro and reverses intestinal inflammation caused by chronic exposure to high fat diet or to the intestinal braking-barrier agent TNBS in a AhR-dependent manner. In these two models, development of colon inflammation associated with upregulation of Ace2 mRNA expression. Colon levels of Ace2 mRNA were directly correlated with Tnf-α mRNA levels. Molecular docking studies suggested that pelargonidin binds a fatty acid binding pocket on the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. In vitro studies demonstrated that pelargonidin significantly reduces the binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to ACE2 and reduces the SARS-CoV-2 replication in a concentration-dependent manner. In summary, we have provided evidence that a natural flavonoid might hold potential in reducing intestinal inflammation and ACE2 induction in the inflamed colon in a AhR-dependent manner.

"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a complex and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta and pathological intracellular accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-syn). In the vast majority of PD patients, the disease has a complex etiology, defined by multiple genetic and environmental risk factors. Common genetic variants in the human leukocyte-antigen (HLA) region have been associated to PD risk and the carriage of these can double the risk to develop PD. Among these common genetic variants are the ones that modulate the expression of MHCII genes. MHCII molecules encoded in the HLA-region are responsible for antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system and have a key role in inflammatory processes. In addition to cis‑variants affecting MHCII expression, a transactivator encoded by the Mhc2ta gene is the major regulator of MHCII expression. We have previously identified variations in the promoter region of Mhc2ta, encoded in the VRA4 region, to regulate MHCII expression in rats. The expression of MHCII is known to be required in the response to α-syn. However, how the expression of MHCII affects the activation of microglial or the impact of physiological, differential Mhc2ta expression on degeneration of dopaminergic neurons has not previously been addressed. Here we addressed the implications of common genetic allelic variants of the major regulator of MHCII expression on α-syn-induced microglia activation and the severity of the dopaminergic neurodegeneration. We used a viral vector technology to overexpress α-syn in two rat strains; Dark agouti (DA) wild type and DA.VRA4-congenic rats. The congenic strain carries PVG alleles in the VRA4 locus and therefore displays lower Mhc2ta expression levels compared to DA rats. We analyzed the impact of this physiological differential Mhc2ta expression on gliosis, inflammation, degeneration of the nigro-striatal dopamine system and behavioral deficits after α-syn overexpression. We report that allelic variants of Mhc2ta differently modified the microglial activation in response to overexpression of human α-syn in rats. Overexpression of α-syn led to a larger denervation of the nigro-striatal system and significant behavioral deficits in DA.VRA4 congenic rats with lower Mhc2ta expression compared to DA rats. These results indicate that Mhc2ta is a key upstream regulator of the inflammatory response in PD pathology.

"Using genetic engineering techniques, two strategies for changing the receptor-binding specificity of the influenza A virus haemagglutinin (HA) protein whilst preserving its membrane fusion function, have been explored. The aim was to investigate whether the HA protein could be developed as an attachment/entry protein for targeting enveloped virus gene therapy vectors to specific cell populations. In the first strategy, a single chain antibody Fv region (scFv) specific for the hapten NIP was inserted between HA1 codons 139 and 145, to create a scFv-HA chimaeric protein. This protein was shown to possess anti-NIP binding activity, but membrane fusion activity could not be demonstrated. The possibility that linking the scFv domain directly to HA may have inhibited the HA fusion function led to the development of the second strategy. This involved separating the receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions of HA on to two different molecules. The feasibility of this strategy was tested by looking for fusion between NIP-conjugated red blood cells which lacked sialic acid (the HA protein's natural receptor) and Chinese hamster ovary cells that expressed both the above anti-NIP scFv-HA chimaeric protein (as a non-fusigenic, receptor-binding molecule) and wild-type HA protein (as a fusigenic, non-binding molecule) on their surface. Cell-to-cell fusion was observed in this system, indicating that the receptor-binding function of HA can be transferred to an adjacent molecule, and also changed in its specificity, without compromising its membrane fusion activity. This finding strongly suggests that the development of a two-molecule attachment and entry system for retargeting enveloped virus gene therapy vectors, based on HA, is a viable proposition.

"The Epstein Barr nuclear antigen (EBNA) and the rheumatoid arthritis nuclear antigen (RANA) develop in human B lymphocytes that have been infected and transformed by Epstein Barr virus (EBV). Antibodies to RANA and EBNA are found only in individuals with prior exposure to EBV. The purpose of the present studies was to determine the relation of the 2 antigens to each other and to EBV genetic material, in human-rodent somatic cell hybrids. Cultured human B lymphoblastoid cells, Raji, Daudi, and RPMI 4098 were fused with thymidine kinase-deficient mouse or hamster fibroblasts. After selection and cloning in ouabain-HAT medium, the hybrid nature of the surviving cells was confirmed by isozyme analysis. The hybrid clones were analyzed for EBNA by anti-complement im,munofluorescence, and for RANA by anti-immunoglobulin immunofluorescence and immunodiffusion. The results showed that RANA and EBNA segregated entirely independently of each other in the hybrid clones. Two methods were used to detect the presence of EBV DNA sequences in the intracellular DNA of hybrid clones. The 1st method relied on the hybridization of labeled cRNA prepared from virion DNA with DNA from 8 hybrid clones affixed to nitrocellulose filters. The 2nd approach was to hybridize labeled intracellular DNA from 3 hybrid clones to Southern blots of cloned fragments of EBV DNA. These results suggested that the presence of EBV DNA was not sufficient for the expression of either antigen. One stable RANA-positive hybrid cell line contained at least 80% of the EBV genome in the absence of detectable EBNA.

"Toll-like receptors 7 (TLR7) and 8 (TLR8) recognize viral single-stranded RNA and small molecular weight agonists to activate anti-viral immune responses. TLR8s from different species have distinct ligand recognitions. For example, human TLR8 is responsive to ligand stimulation, but mouse and rat TLR8 are activated by small molecular weight agonists only in the presence of polyT-oligodeoxynucleotides. TLR7 and TLR8 have been reported to be absent and pseudogenized, respectively, in rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In this study, we detected the expression of rabbit (rab)TLR8 in immune-cell-associated tissues. Cell proliferation and cytokine expressions in rabbit splenocytes were induced by the TLR7/8 ligand but not by the TLR7 ligands, suggesting that rabTLR8 is functional but rabTLR7 is not. In rabbits, CL075, a TLR7/8 ligand, activated an antigen-specific antibody response, although one not as potent as aluminum salt or Freund's adjuvant. Nevertheless, CL075, alone or in combination with aluminum salt, generates fewer adverse effects than Freund's adjuvant at the injection sites. To further investigate the activation of rabTLR8, we cloned its cDNA. In cell-based assay, this rabTLR8 is activated by TLR7/8 ligand but not activated by TLR7 ligand. Upon stimulation the rabTLR8 had a lower activation compared to the activation of TLR8 from other species, except the mouse and rat TLR8s. Using different deletion and human-rabbit chimeric TLR8 expressing constructs, we showed that an extra peptide in the undefined region results in reduced activity of rabTLR8. These results provide a molecular basis for the mild activities of TLR7/8 ligands in rabbits, and suggest TLR7/8 agonists may provide safer immune stimuli in rabbits than in other non-rodent species.

"Lactic acidosis has been reported as a complication associated with antiretroviral therapy; in particular, usually with use of nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. We describe a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient with a history of lipodystrophy who presented with hepatic insult associated with documented human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE). Despite a normal serum lactate level before the onset of acute coinfection, the patient developed symptomatic hyperlactatemia while receiving appropriate treatment for HGE. To date, this is the first presentation of symptomatic hyperlactatemia in a patient with HIV infection and HGE.

"Although AKT1 (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homologue 1) kinase is a central member of possibly the most frequently activated proliferation and survival pathway in cancer, mutation of AKT1 has not been widely reported. Here we report the identification of a somatic mutation in human breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers that results in a glutamic acid to lysine substitution at amino acid 17 (E17K) in the lipid-binding pocket of AKT1. Lys 17 alters the electrostatic interactions of the pocket and forms new hydrogen bonds with a phosphoinositide ligand. This mutation activates AKT1 by means of pathological localization to the plasma membrane, stimulates downstream signalling, transforms cells and induces leukaemia in mice. This mechanism indicates a direct role of AKT1 in human cancer, and adds to the known genetic alterations that promote oncogenesis through the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase/AKT pathway. Furthermore, the E17K substitution decreases the sensitivity to an allosteric kinase inhibitor, so this mutation may have important clinical utility for AKT drug development.

"The greatest challenge facing liver transplantation today is the shortage of donor livers. Demand far exceeds supply, and this deficit has driven expansion of what is considered an acceptable organ. The evolving standard has not come without costs, however, as each new frontier of expanded donor quality (i.e., advancing donor age, donation after cardiac death, and split liver) may have traded wait-list for post-transplant morbidity and mortality. This article delineates the nature and severity of risk associated with specific deceased donor liver characteristics and recommends strategies to maximally mitigate these risks.

"Alphaviruses synthesize large amounts of both genomic and subgenomic RNA in infected cells, but usually only the genomic RNA is packaged. This implies the existence of an encapsidation or packaging signal which would be responsible for selectivity. Previously, we had identified a region of the Sindbis virus genome that interacts specifically with the viral capsid protein. This 132-nucleotide (nt) fragment lies within the coding region of the nsP1 gene (nt 945 to 1076). We proposed that the 132-mer is important for capsid recognition and initiates the formation of the viral nucleocapsid. To study the encapsidation of Sindbis virus RNAs in infected cells, we designed a new assay that uses the self-replicating Sindbis virus genomes (replicons) which lack the viral structural protein genes and contain heterologous sequences under the control of the subgenomic RNA promoter. These replicons can be packaged into viral particles by using defective helper RNAs that contain the structural protein genes (P. Bredenbeek, I. Frolov, C. M. Rice, and S. Schlesinger, J. Virol. 67:6439-6446, 1993). Insertion of the 132-mer into the subgenomic RNA significantly increased the packaging of this RNA into viral particles. We have used this assay and defective helpers that contain the structural protein genes of Ross River virus (RRV) to investigate the location of the encapsidation signal in the RRV genome. Our results show that there are several fragments that could act as packaging signals. They are all located in a different region of the genome than the signal for the Sindbis virus genome. For RRV, the strongest packaging signal lies between nt 2761 and 3062 in the nsP2 gene. This is the same region that was proposed to contain the packaging signal for Semliki Forest virus genomic RNA.

"This review focuses on the early diagnosis of anal cancer and its precursor lesions through routine screening. A number of risk-stratification strategies as well as screening techniques have been suggested, and currently little consensus exists among national societies. Much of the current clinical rationale for the prevention of anal cancer derives from the similar tumor biology of cervical cancer and the successful use of routine screening to identify cervical cancer and its precursors early in the disease process. It is thought that such a strategy of identifying early anal intraepithelial neoplasia will reduce the incidence of invasive anal cancer. The low prevalence of anal cancer in the general population prevents the use of routine screening. However, routine screening of selected populations has been shown to be a more promising strategy. Potential screening modalities include digital anorectal exam, anal Papanicolaou testing, human papilloma virus co-testing, and high-resolution anoscopy. Additional research associating high-grade dysplasia treatment with anal cancer prevention as well as direct comparisons of screening regimens is necessary to develop further anal cancer screening recommendations.

"The self-assembly of supramolecular complexes of nucleic acids and polymers is of relevance to several biological processes including viral and chromatin formation as well as gene therapy vector design. We now show that template polymerization facilitates condensation of DNA into particles that are <150 nm in diameter. Inclusion of a poly(ethylene glycol)-containing monomer prevents aggregation of these particles. The DNA within the particles remains biologically active and can express foreign genes in cells. The formation or breakage of covalent bonds has until now not been employed to compact DNA into artificial particles.

"For several decades, the populations of the European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have declined, which is partly due to myxomatosis. Vaccination against this disease is expected to contribute to restoration of rabbit populations but the actual impact of myxomatosis is not well known and vaccination might have some negative effects. We analyzed the capture-mark-recapture data obtained in a 4-year field experiment (1991-1994) in a park near Paris, France wherein 300 out of 565 seronegative juvenile rabbits were vaccinated at first capture against myxomatosis with the nontransmissible Dervaximyxo SG33 vaccine. After accounting for weight at first capture, age-class (juvenile/adult), ""trap-happiness"" and season (spring/autumn) of the capture event, vaccinated rabbits had 1.8-fold greater odds of surviving than the unvaccinated rabbits. The average summer survival risk for vaccinated juveniles was 0.63 (+/-0.08 S.E.) whereas it was 0.48 (+/-0.08 S.E.) for unvaccinated juvenile rabbits.

"An empirical formula was developed for determining the vulnerability of unconfined sandy aquifers to virus contamination, expressed as a dimensionless setback distance r(s)(*). The formula can be used to calculate the setback distance required for the protection of drinking water production wells against virus contamination. This empirical formula takes into account the intrinsic properties of the virus and the unconfined sandy aquifer. Virus removal is described by a rate coefficient that accounts for virus inactivation and attachment to sand grains. The formula also includes pumping rate, saturated thickness of the aquifer, depth of the screen of the pumping well, and anisotropy of the aquifer. This means that it accounts also for dilution effects as well as horizontal and vertical virus transport. Because the empirical model includes virus source concentration it can be used as an integral part of a quantitative viral risk assessment.

"In 2009-2010, the H1N1 episode occurred in a general context of decreasing public confidence in vaccination. We assumed opposition to vaccination in general to be an 'unfounded fear', reflecting ignorance and perceived vulnerability among low-socioeconomic status (SES) people, and opposition to the H1N1 vaccine a 'legitimate concern' reflecting the elite's commitment to 'risk culture' in a 'risk society'. We indirectly tested these assumptions by investigating the socioeconomic profiles associated with opposition to vaccination in general and opposition to the H1N1 vaccine specifically. Our second aim was to determine whether or not opposition to the H1N1 vaccine fuelled opposition to vaccination in general. We used data from a telephone survey conducted in 2009-2010 among a random sample of French people aged 15-79 (N = 9480). Attitudes toward vaccination in general and toward the H1N1 vaccine specifically varied significantly between October 2009 and June 2010 with strong correlation being observed between these attitudes throughout the whole period. In multivariable analysis attitudes toward vaccination in general remained a significant predictor of attitudes to the H1N1 vaccine and vice versa, for distinct profiles as follows: males, older people, low-SES people for opposition to vaccination in general, versus females, people aged 35-49 and those with an intermediate SES for opposition to the H1N1 vaccine. Results also differed regarding indicators of social vulnerability, proximity to preventive medicine and vaccination history. The first profile supported the ""unfounded fears expressed by low-SES people"" hypothesis, while the second echoed previous work related to middle-classes' ""healthism"". Opposition to vaccination should not be reduced to irrational reactions reflecting ignorance or misinformation and further research is needed to acquire a greater understanding of the motives of opponents.

"Avian H7N9 influenza viruses are group 2 influenza A viruses that have been identified as the etiologic agent for a current major outbreak that began in China in 2013 and may pose a pandemic threat. Here, we examined the human H7-reactive antibody response in 75 recipients of a monovalent inactivated A/Shanghai/02/2013 H7N9 vaccine. After 2 doses of vaccine, the majority of donors had memory B cells that secreted IgGs specific for H7 HA, with dominant responses against single HA subtypes, although frequencies of H7-reactive B cells ranged widely between donors. We isolated 12 naturally occurring mAbs with low half-maximal effective concentrations for binding, 5 of which possessed neutralizing and HA-inhibiting activities. The 5 neutralizing mAbs exhibited narrow breadth of reactivity with influenza H7 strains. Epitope-mapping studies using neutralization escape mutant analysis, deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography revealed that these neutralizing mAbs bind near the receptor-binding pocket on HA. All 5 neutralizing mAbs possessed low numbers of somatic mutations, suggesting the clones arose from naive B cells. The most potent mAb, H7.167, was tested as a prophylactic treatment in a mouse intranasal virus challenge study, and systemic administration of the mAb markedly reduced viral lung titers.

"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoproteins (E1 and E2) interact to form a heterodimeric complex, which has been proposed as a functional subunit of the HCV virion envelope. As examined in cell culture transient-expression assays, the formation of properly folded, noncovalently associated E1E2 complexes is a slow and inefficient process. Due to lack of appropriate immunological reagents, it has been difficult to distinguish between glycoprotein molecules that undergo productive folding and assembly from those which follow a nonproductive pathway leading to misfolding and aggregation. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a conformation-sensitive E2-reactive monoclonal antibody (H2). The H2 monoclonal antibody selectively recognizes slowly maturing E1E2 heterodimers which are noncovalently linked, protease resistant, and no longer associated with the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone calnexin. This complex probably represents the native prebudding form of the HCV glycoprotein heterodimer. Besides providing a novel reagent for basic studies on HCV virion assembly and entry, this monoclonal antibody should be useful for optimizing production and isolation of native HCV glycoprotein complexes for serodiagnostic and vaccine applications.

"The minimal signal required for the cleavage and packaging of replicated concatemeric herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) DNA corresponds to an approximately 200-bp fragment, Uc-DR1-Ub, spanning the junction of the genomic L and S segments. Uc and Ub occupy positions adjacent to the L and S termini and contain motifs (pac2 and pac1, respectively) that are conserved near the ends of other herpesvirus genomes. We have used homologous Red/ET recombination in Escherichia coli to introduce wild-type and specifically mutated Uc-DR1-Ub fragments into an ectopic site of a cloned HSV-1 genome from which the resident packaging signals had been previously deleted. The resulting constructs were transfected into mammalian cells, and their abilities to replicate and become encapsidated, generate Uc- and Ub-containing terminal fragments, and give rise to progeny virus were assessed. In general, the results obtained agree well with previous observations made using amplicons and confirm roles for the pac2 T element in the initiation of DNA packaging and for the GC-rich motifs flanking the pac1 T element in termination. In contrast to a previous report, the sequence of the DR1 element was also crucial for DNA packaging. Following repair of the resident packaging signals in mammalian cells, recombination occurred at high frequency in progeny virus between the repaired sequences and mutated Uc-DR1-Ub inserts. This restored the ability of mutated Uc-DR1-Ub inserts to generate terminal fragments, although these were frequently larger than expected from simple repair of the original lesion.

"Present efforts of HBV vaccine research are aimed at defining targeted antigen compositions and adjuvancy systems for earlier and broader immune responses and optimization of immunotherapeutic approaches. We have demonstrated the applicability of the WHV/Marmota monax model for the evaluation of immunogenicity and protection of new formulations of HBV vaccines for human use. Protective activity was evaluated following the administrations of HBV CHO-PreS/S and adjuvanted S/Core vaccines. The administration of a complex constituted by HBV derived woodchuck PreS/S antibodies coupled with WHV particles was able to induce inhibition of viral replication. Future studies on treatment of HBV chronic infection should be addressed to the evaluation of therapies combined with antivirals, vaccines and immunomodulatory compounds.

"The characterisation of the pleiotropic effects of coat colour-associated mutations in mammals illustrates that sensory organs and nerves are particularly affected by disorders because of the shared origin of melanocytes and neurocytes in the neural crest; e.g. the eye-colour is a valuable indicator of disorders in pigment production and eye dysfunctions. Disorders related to coat colour-associated alleles also occur in the skin (melanoma), reproductive tract and immune system. Additionally, the coat colour phenotype of an individual influences its general behaviour and fitness. Mutations in the same genes often produce similar coat colours and pleiotropic effects in different species (e.g., KIT [reproductive disorders, lethality], EDNRB [megacolon] and LYST [CHS]). Whereas similar disorders and similar-looking coat colour phenotypes sometimes have a different genetic background (e.g., deafness [EDN3/EDNRB, MITF, PAX and SNAI2] and visual diseases [OCA2, RAB38, SLC24A5, SLC45A2, TRPM1 and TYR]). The human predilection for fancy phenotypes that ignore disorders and genetic defects is a major driving force for the increase of pleiotropic effects in domestic species and laboratory subjects since domestication has commenced approximately 18,000 years ago.

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is highly lethal to the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). It was first reported in 1984 in China, but in 2010, a new variant of the virus was detected (GI.2) in France. Several recombination events with pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains have been described. Here, we report the first sequences of RHDV in Africa, isolated from Moroccan rabbits, and these resemble GI.1b/GI.1b/GI.2 recombinants found in the Iberian Peninsula. Monitoring and characterization of strains from future outbreaks are advised to guarantee the success of current programs on small-rabbit production for poverty alleviation in African countries.

"Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has become a major public health concern worldwide. This disease presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from a mild cold-like illness to the more serious hemorrhagic dengue fever and dengue shock syndrome. Currently, neither an approved drug nor an effective vaccine for the treatment are available to fight the disease. The envelope protein (E) is a major component of the virion surface. This protein plays a key role during the viral entry process, constituting an attractive target for the development of antiviral drugs. The crystal structure of the E protein reveals the existence of a hydrophobic pocket occupied by the detergent n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (β-OG). This pocket lies at the hinge region between domains I and II and is important for the low pH-triggered conformational rearrangement required for the fusion of the virion with the host's cell. Aiming at the design of novel molecules which bind to E and act as virus entry inhibitors, we undertook a de novo design approach by ""growing"" molecules inside the hydrophobic site (β-OG). From more than 240000 small-molecules generated, the 2,4 pyrimidine scaffold was selected as the best candidate, from which one synthesized compound displayed micromolar activity. Molecular dynamics-based optimization was performed on this hit, and thirty derivatives were designed in silico, synthesized and evaluated on their capacity to inhibit dengue virus entry into the host cell. Four compounds were found to be potent antiviral compounds in the low-micromolar range. The assessment of drug-like physicochemical and in vitro pharmacokinetic properties revealed that compounds 3e and 3h presented acceptable solubility values and were stable in mouse plasma, simulated gastric fluid, simulated intestinal fluid, and phosphate buffered saline solution.

"BACKGROUND: Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) causes great losses in rice, maize and wheat production in Asian countries. The use of serological methods for RBSDV detection depends on the availability of antibodies. In this study, three highly sensitive and specific murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against RBSDV antigens were produced using crude extracts from tumors of RBSDV-infected maize as the immunogen, and two serological assays, antigen-coated-plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA) and dot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) were developed for RBSDV detection. RESULTS: All three MAbs reacted strongly and specifically with the crude extracts from RBSDV-infected plant and planthopper tissues. The detection endpoints of three MAbs (12E10, 18F10 and 5G5) in ACP-ELISA were respectively 1:40,960, 1:40,960, 1:81,920 (w/v, g mL-1) with the crude extract of infected maize, 1:10,240, 1:20,480, 1:20,480 (w/v, g mL-1) with the crude extract of infected rice, 1:5,120, 1:10,240, 1:10,240 (w/v, g mL-1) with the crude extract of infected wheat, 1:9,600, 1:9,600, 19,200 (individual planthopper/μL) with the crude extract of infected planthopper. The newly developed ACP-ELISA could detect the virus in the infected maize, wheat, rice tissue crude extracts diluted at 1:81,920, 1:20,480, 1:10,240 (w/v, g mL-1), respectively, and in individual viruliferous planthopper extract diluted at 1:19200 (individual planthopper/μL). The dot-ELISA was proved to detect the virus in the infected maize, wheat and rice tissue crude extracts diluted at 1:320 (w/v, g mL-1), and in individual viruliferous planthopper extract diluted at 1:1,600 (individual planthopper/μL), respectively. Field plants (915) and planthopper samples (594) from five provinces of China were screened for the presence of RBSDV using the two developed serological assays. The results indicated that 338 of the 915 plant samples and 19 of the 594 planthopper samples were infected by RBSDV. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed ACP-ELISA and dot-ELISA were highly sensitive and specific to detect RBSDV in field plant and planthopper samples. The field survey demonstrated that RBSDV is widespread in rice, maize and wheat crops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong provinces of China.

"Efficiency of viral promoters and various cell lines in directing high-level expression of human erythropoietin (Epo) was investigated. To investigate the effects of various viral promoters and cell lines on the Epo expression level, genomic Epo with the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) deleted was cloned next to the simian virus 40 early promoter, cytomegalovirus early promoter or SRalpha promoter. These expression vectors were transfected into COS-7, BHK-21 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)/dhfr(-) cells, respectively. The COS-7 cells transfected with the vector containing the SRalpha promoter showed the highest expression level ( approximately 103 IU/ml) at 72 h post-transfection. For the development of Epo-producing stable cell lines, BHK-21 and CHO/dhfr(-) cells transfected with the 5',3'-UTR-deleted genomic Epo under the control of the SRalpha promoter were cultured with media containing zeocin. Several clones of zeocin-resistant BHK-21 and CHO/dhfr(-) cells were cultured in the presence of methotrexate (MTX). A BHK-21 clone selected in the presence of 500 nM MTX expressed and secreted approximately 490 IU/ml Epo into the medium. A CHO/dhfr(-) clone selected in the presence of 20 nM MTX expressed and secreted approximately 45 IU/ml Epo into the medium. Southern-blot analysis indicated that enhancement of Epo expression in the MTX-resistant stable cells might be related to the amplification of gene copy number.

"The determinants of the maintenance of chronic hepadnaviral infection are yet to be fully understood. A long-standing unresolved argument in the hepatitis B virus (HBV) research field suggests that during chronic hepadnaviral infection, cell-to-cell spread of hepadnavirus is at least very inefficient (if it occurs at all), virus superinfection is an unlikely event, and chronic hepadnavirus infection can be maintained exclusively via division of infected hepatocytes in the absence of virus spread. Superinfection exclusion was previously shown for duck HBV, but it was not demonstrated for HBV or HBV-related woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). Three woodchucks, which were chronically infected with the strain WHV7 and already developed WHV-induced hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), were superinfected with another WHV strain, WHVNY. Six weeks after the superinfection, the woodchucks were sacrificed and tissues of the livers and HCCs were examined. The WHVNY superinfection was demonstrated by using WHV strain-specific PCR assays and (i) finding WHVNY relaxed circular DNA in the serum samples collected from all superinfected animals during weeks one through six after the superinfection, (ii) detecting replication-derived WHVNY RNA in the tissue samples of the livers and HCCs collected from three superinfected woodchucks, and (iii) finding WHVNY DNA replication intermediates in tissues harvested after the superinfection. The results are consistent with the occurrence of continuous but inefficient hepadnavirus cell-to-cell spread and superinfection during chronic infection and suggest that the replication space occupied by the superinfecting hepadnavirus in chronically infected livers is limited. The findings are discussed in the context of the mechanism of chronic hepadnavirus infection. IMPORTANCE: This study aimed to better understand the determinants of the maintenance of chronic hepadnavirus infection. The generated data suggest that in the livers chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus, (i) hepadnavirus superinfection and cell-to-cell spread likely continue to occur and (ii) the virus spread is apparently inefficient, which is consistent with the interpretation that a limited number of cells in the livers facilitates the spread of hepadnavirus. The limitations of the cell-to-cell virus spread most likely are mediated at the level of the cells and do not reflect the properties of the virus. Our results further advance the understanding of the mechanism of chronic hepadnavirus infection. The significance of the continuous but limited hepadnavirus spread and superinfection for the maintenance of the chronic state of infection should be further evaluated in follow-up studies in order to determine whether blocking the virus spread would facilitate the suppression of chronic hepadnavirus infection.

"Low fidelity replication and the absence of error-repair activities in RNA viruses result in complex and adaptable ensembles of related genomes in the viral population, termed quasispecies, with important implications for natural infections. Theoretical predictions suggested that elevated replication error rates in RNA viruses might be near to a maximum compatible with viral viability. This fact encouraged the use of mutagenic nucleosides as a new antiviral strategy to induce viral extinction through increased replication error rates. Despite extensive evidence of lethal mutagenesis of RNA viruses by different mutagenic compounds, a detailed picture of the infectivity of individual genomes and its relationship with the mutations accumulated is lacking. Here, we report a molecular analysis of a foot-and-mouth disease virus population previously subjected to heavy mutagenesis to determine whether a correlation between increased mutagenesis and decreased fitness existed. Plaque-purified viruses isolated from a ribavirin-treated quasispecies presented decreases of up to 200-fold in infectivity relative to clones in the reference population, associated with an overall eightfold increase in the mutation frequency. This observation suggests that individual infectious genomes of a quasispecies subjected to increased mutagenesis lose infectivity by their continuous mutagenic 'poisoning'. These results support the lethal defection model of virus extinction and the practical use of chemical mutagens as antiviral treatment. Even when extinction is not achieved, mutagenesis can decrease the infectivity of surviving virus, and facilitate their clearance by host immune responses or complementing antiviral approaches.

"Enveloped viruses exploit the endomembrane system to enter host cells. Through a cascade of membrane-trafficking events, virus-bearing vesicles fuse with acidic endosomes and/or lysosomes mediated by SNAREs triggering viral fusion. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain elusive. Here, we found that UV-radiation resistance-associated gene (UVRAG), an autophagic tumor suppressor, is required for the entry of the prototypic negative-strand RNA virus, including influenza A virus and vesicular stomatitis virus, by a mechanism independent of IFN and autophagy. UVRAG mediates viral endocytic transport and membrane penetration through interactions with the class C vacuolar protein sorting (C-Vps) tethering complex and endosomal glutamine-containing SNAREs [syntaxin 7 (STX7), STX8, and vesicle transport through t-SNARE homolog 1B (Vti1b)], leading to the assembly of a fusogenic trans-SNARE complex involving vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP8), but not VAMP7. Indeed, UVRAG stimulates VAMP8 translocation to virus-bearing endosomes. Inhibition of VAMP8, but not VAMP7, significantly reduces viral entry. Our data indicate that UVRAG, in concert with C-Vps, regulates viral entry by assembling a specific fusogenic SNARE complex. Thus, UVRAG governs downstream viral entry, highlighting an important pathway capable of potential antiviral therapeutics.

"The murine MHC class II variant I-Ad confers susceptibility to herpes simplex virus (HSV)-induced keratitis and relative protection against type 1 diabetes mellitus. The association to these autoimmune diseases appears to be largely determined by the peptide sidechain specificity of the P9 pocket, which we therefore have analyzed in detail. Assessment of T-cell responses and I-Ad binding capacity of position 446-substituted analogs of an IgG2a allotype b (IgG2a(b)) heavy chain peptide demonstrates that engagement of the P9 pocket is crucial for effective peptide presentation. Sidechain size rather than charge decides the capacity to engage the P9 pocket. Thus, small, uncharged sidechains are accepted, whereas acidic and aromatic amino acids as well as lysine and arginine are disfavored. The specificity of the P9 pocket of I-Ad (serine beta57) is distinct from that of the diabetes-associated I-Ag7 (aspartic acid beta57), supporting the contention that the polymorphism at residue beta57 influences diabetes susceptibility via P9-specific effects on the repertoires of self peptides presented to T cells. Furthermore, the data rationalize the susceptibility to HSV-induced keratitis conferred by the a and the protection conferred by the b allotypes of the IgG2a heavy chain. Keratitogenic T cells, which cross-react with the viral UL6 protein and a corneal antigen, are silenced in IgG2a(b) mice because of antigenic mimicry with gamma2a(b) 435-451. Our finding that the lysine P9 residue of the corresponding gamma2a(a) allopeptide precludes high-affinity binding to I-Ad indicates that the susceptibility of IgG2a(a) mice reflects inefficient thymic presentation of autologous IgG2a and thus failure to purge the T-cell repertoire of the pathogenic clones.

"Preparation conditions of a DNA vaccine against swine influenza encapsulated in chitosan nanoparticles were determined. The nanoparticles were prepared according to a complex coacervation method using chitosan as a biodegradable matrix forming polymer. Under the preparation conditions, chitosan nanoparticles containing the DNA vaccine were produced with good morphology, high encapsulation rate and high stability. Transfection test indicated that the vaccine could be expressed as an antigen in cells, and maintained good bioactivity. In addition, better immune responses of mice immunized with the chitosan nanoparticles containing the DNA vaccine were induced and prolonged release of the plasmid DNA was achieved compared to the DNA vaccine alone. These results laid a foundation for further development of DNA vaccines in nanoparticles before ultimate industrial application.

"Studies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in laboratory mice and humans have shown that spirochaetes disseminate from the site of infection (skin) to internal tissues, and cause various pathological effects. However, less is known about colonization and pathology of Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes in their natural hosts. In the present study, we assessed the colonization and manifestations during B. afzelii infection in reservoir hosts (yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis; bank vole, Myodes glareolus; common shrew, Sorex araneus) infected in the wild. The infection prevalence and bacterial load was measured in skin (ear), joints and heart by quantitative PCR, and pathology in infected joints was evaluated by histology. The prevalence of B. afzelii was higher in skin than in joints and heart, but most animals that were positive in skin were also positive in internal tissues, and there was no difference between species in tissue-specific prevalence. Thus, spirochaetes disseminated from skin to other tissues in a similar way in all species. The bacterial load varied among host species and among different tissues within the same host species. In the case of skin and joints, bank voles and common shrews had higher bacterial loads than yellow-necked mice. In hearts, voles had higher bacterial loads than shrews and mice. Histological analyses showed no inflammation in joints of infected animals when compared to controls. We conclude that B. afzelii disseminates to internal tissues in natural hosts, but that levels of colonization vary between both species and tissues. There is as yet little evidence for pathological effects in natural hosts.

"The objective of this study was to investigate leaching and transport of viruses, specifically those of an indigenous coliphage host specific to Escherichia coli ATTC 15597 (i.e., MS-2), from a biosolid-soil matrix. Serial extractions of 2% and 7% (solids) class B biosolid matrices were performed to determine the number of phage present in the biosolids and to evaluate their general leaching potential. Significant concentrations of coliphage were removed from the biosolids for each sequential extraction, indicating that many phage remained associated with the solid phase. The fact that phage was associated with or attached to solid particles appeared to influence the potential for release and subsequent transport of phage under saturated-flow conditions, which was examined in a series of column experiments. The results indicated that less than 8% of the indigenous coliphage initially present in the biosolids leached out of the biosolid-soil matrix. A fraction of this was subsequently transported through the sandy porous medium with minimal retention. The minimal retention observed for the indigenous phage, once released from the biosolids, was consistent with the results of control experiments conducted to examine MS-2 transport through the porous medium.

"Human B lymphocytes activated by mitogens or infected by Epstein Barr virus (EBV) have previously been shown to release colony-stimulating activity (CSA) supporting the growth of normal human bone marrow progenitors. We established five different human EBV-B cell lines spontaneously outgrown from nonmalignant peripheral blood cells and long-term bone marrow cultures. CSA derived from all of these lines induces the growth of murine macrophage colonies, whereas virtually no human bone marrow cell progenitors were stimulated. As observed in the tumor cell line MIA PaCa-2, a 4.3-kilobase (kb) transcript was detected in all cases using a human colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1 probe. Expression of this transcript can be further stimulated within three hours upon addition of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). The highly purified native protein exerting macrophage colony-stimulating activity (M-CSA) exhibits a molecular size of approximately 75 to 97 Kd in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The identity of EBV-B cell derived M-CSA with human urinary CSF-1 was confirmed by a complete neutralization of macrophage CSA by an antihuman urinary CSF-1 antiserum. Normal human B lymphocytes purified from tonsils or from mononuclear blood cells also express CSF-1 upon stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I. No CSF-1 expression, however, could be detected in normal resting B lymphocytes or in the Burkitt lymphoma cell line RAJI.

"BACKGROUND: It is well appreciated that obtaining sufficient numbers of primary microglia for in vitro experiments has always been a challenge for scientists studying the biological properties of these cells. Supplementing culture medium with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) partially alleviates this problem by increasing microglial yield. However, GM-CSF has also been reported to transition microglia into a dendritic cell (DC)-like phenotype and consequently, affect their immune properties. METHODS: Although the concentration of GM-CSF used in our protocol for mouse microglial expansion (0.5 ng/ml) is at least 10-fold less compared to doses reported to affect microglial maturation and function (>/= 5 ng/ml), in this study we compared the responses of microglia derived from mixed glial cultures propagated in the presence/absence of low dose GM-CSF to establish whether this growth factor significantly altered the immune properties of microglia to diverse bacterial stimuli. These stimuli included the gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and its cell wall product peptidoglycan (PGN), a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonist; the TLR3 ligand polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), a synthetic mimic of viral double-stranded RNA; lipopolysaccharide (LPS) a TLR4 agonist; and the TLR9 ligand CpG oligonucleotide (CpG-ODN), a synthetic form of bacteria/viral DNA. RESULTS: Interestingly, the relative numbers of microglia recovered from mixed glial cultures following the initial harvest were not influenced by GM-CSF. However, following the second and third collections of the same mixed cultures, the yield of microglia from GM-CSF-supplemented flasks was increased two-fold. Despite the ability of GM-CSF to expand microglial numbers, cells propagated in the presence/absence of GM-CSF demonstrated roughly equivalent responses following S. aureus and PGN stimulation. Specifically, the induction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2/CXCL2), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, CD80, CD86 expression by microglia in response to S. aureus were similar regardless of whether cells had been exposed to GM-CSF during the mixed culture period. In addition, microglial phagocytosis of intact bacteria was unaffected by GM-CSF. In contrast, upon S. aureus stimulation, CD40 expression was induced more prominently in microglia expanded in GM-CSF. Analysis of microglial responses to additional pathogen-associate molecular patterns (PAMPs) revealed that low dose GM-CSF did not significantly alter TNF-alpha or MIP-2 production in response to the TLR3 and TLR4 agonists polyI:C or LPS, respectively; however, cells expanded in the presence of GM-CSF produced lower levels of both mediators following CpG-ODN stimulation. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that low levels of GM-CSF are sufficient to expand microglial numbers without significantly affecting their immunological responses following activation of TLR2, TLR4 or TLR3 signaling. Therefore, low dose GM-CSF can be considered as a reliable method to achieve higher microglial yields without introducing dramatic activation artifacts.

"Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a lagovirus that causes rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). In 2010, a new genotype called RHDV2 emerged in France. It exhibits a larger host range than classical RHDV strains by sporadically infecting different hare species, including the European hare (Lepus europaeus). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that closely related RHDV2 strains circulate locally in both hares and rabbits, and therefore that RHDV2 strains infecting hares do not belong to a lineage that has evolved only in this species. We showed that RHDV2 is widely distributed in France and that it was responsible for more than a third of cases of lagovirus disease in European hare populations in 2015. The oldest RHDV2 positive hare was sampled in November 2013 and we reported two hares co-infected by EBHSV and RHDV2. All together, our results raise important epidemiological and evolutionary issues. In particular, along with the potential emergence of recombinant EBHSV/RHDV2 strains in hares, the enlargement of the host range changes the host population structure of RHDV2 and may alter the impact of the virus on rabbit and hare populations.

"Transcripts related to the human carcinoembryonic antigen were found in mRNA isolated from both dimethylbenzanthracene-induced and mouse mammary tumor virus-induced mammary tumors. A cDNA library was prepared from a dimethylbenzanthracene-induced tumor, and a clone was isolated by hybridization with a human carcinoembryonic antigen cDNA probe. Its sequence, when compared to those of members of the human carcinoembryonic antigen gene family, was most homologous to the sequence of the human biliary glycoprotein (BGP) gene. Thus, this clone appears to encode a portion of the mouse biliary glycoprotein gene. Southern blot analysis of EcoRI-digested mouse cellular DNA with this probe detected four restriction fragments, all of which appear to be located on mouse chromosome 7, Northern blot analysis using the mouse probe demonstrated that related mRNA species were expressed in some normal adult mouse tissues.

"In the northeastern United States, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), is transmitted by the tick vector Ixodes scapularis. The white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus is a competent reservoir for this agent, but the reservoir competence of non-Peromyscus hosts of I. scapularis has not been studied. Here, we report data confirming reservoir competence of medium-sized mammals for A. phagocytophilum. Raccoons, Virginia opossums, gray squirrels, and striped skunks were live-trapped in June-August of 1998-1999 at two locations in Connecticut. Captured animals were kept for several days at the laboratory in wire-mesh cages over water to allow naturally attached ticks to drop off. Samples of blood and serum were taken from each animal prior to its release at the site of capture. Engorged ticks collected from each animal were allowed to molt. Resulting I. scapularis nymphs and adults were tested for the presence of A. phagocytophilum DNA by polymerase chain reaction, as were the blood samples from the animals. A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected in the blood of >10% of the raccoons tested. Raccoons, opossums, squirrels, and skunks produced adult I. scapularis infected with the agent of HGE. Prevalence of infection was the highest in adult ticks fed as nymphs upon raccoons (23%) and the lowest in those fed upon skunks and opossums (5-7%). The agent was present in nymphal I. scapularis fed as larvae upon raccoons and squirrels, but not in ticks fed upon skunks or opossums. We also tested the ability of I. scapularis to transmit A. phagocytophilum to laboratory-reared white-footed mice after acquiring it from medium-sized mammals. Ticks that acquired the agent from raccoons and squirrels successfully transmitted it to mice. Thus, raccoons and gray squirrels are reservoir-competent for the agent of HGE-they become naturally infected, and are capable of transmitting the infection to feeding ticks.

"Dengue is the single most important human viral infection transmitted by insects. The function of the viral proteins andtheir interactions with the host cell is under exhaustive investigation with the aim of identifying antiviral strategies. Here,using recombinant full-length dengue virus genomes, carrying a fluorescent mCherry fused to capsid, we studied biophysicalproperties of the viral protein during one infectious cycle in living cells. Dengue virus capsid protein associates to differentcellular compartments but its function in these locations is largely unknown. We evaluated the diffusion of capsid inside the celland determined a higher effective diffusion coefficient in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus. Using advanced fluorescencecorrelation methods, including the recently developed two-dimensional pair correlation analysis, we constructed for the first timehigh resolution maps of capsid mobility in an infected cell. We observed that the motion of capsid in the nucleoplasm-nucleolusinterface was highly organized, indicating an obstacle in this interface. Although nucleoli are membraneless structures, theydisplayed liquid-liquid phase separation. Once inside nucleoli, the protein showed isotropic mobility, indicating free diffusion orimmobilized capsid inside these structures. This is the first study presenting spatial and temporal dynamics of the dengue viruscapsid protein during infection.

"The pressing need for large-scale culture methods has prompted efforts to develop vessels which will accommodate the growth of large numbers of anchorage-dependent cells. The large-scale ""cell factories"" have been used to grow viruses for vaccine production, nucleic acid studies, and various cancer research projects. Two particular types of culture vessels used for large-scale production of anchorage-dependent cells were discussed and examples of their use in vaccine production given. Development of these large-scale culture systems has enabled the pharmaceutical companies to (1) meet the ever-increasing demands worldwide for vaccine, (2) employ a production process that produces a cost-efficient vaccine product in cell culture, and (3) produce large volumes of bulk vaccine at a single campaign, thus allowing multiple usage of a single production unit over the course of a year. The type of large-scale culture vessel used depends on the purpose of the culture and the type of cells that are to be grown in the vessel. The unit process vessel, with its multidisks, provides superior surface area, but because of the stainless steel housing, the cells cannot be monitored microscopically. Additionally, the unit process vessel can be equipped with a jacket for precise temperature regulation and thus eliminate the need for incubators. The roller bottles, on the other hand, allow microscopic monitoring of the growing cells but are limited in surface area available for growth, and the volume of harvest fluid obtainable from a bottle is very limited. It should be noted that handling of roller bottles is labor-intensive and requires many more manipulations and hence more personnel than employing unit process-type vessels for vaccine-manufacturing operations. The use of mass cultivation techniques in cancer research has also been of immense benefit. The production of large numbers of neoplastic cells has provided researchers with the raw materials to perform molecular biology experiments such as DNA sequencing, which required milligram quantities of cells before sufficient quantities of DNA could be isolated to allow sequencing studies. Additionally, the technique of mass cultivation also provided sufficient quantities of cells for inoculation into either nude mice or immunosuppressed hamsters in an attempt to determine the tumor induction capacity of the cultured cells. Additional characterization studies which require large numbers of cell, enzyme, and isoenzyme profiles can also be performed on cells grown in roller bottle cultures. There are numerous factors which limit the productivity of mass cultivation systems and the scientist should be aware of their existence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

"Myxomatosis is a specific disease of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) due to a virus belonging to the genus Leporipoxvirus. Forty-seven years after its deliberate introduction into Europe, the clinical aspects and the epizootiology of myxomatosis have changed. Two forms (nodular and amyxomatous) of the disease have been identified to date. A comparative study was made of the clinical signs, pathogenesis and gross lesions observed in male specific pathogen-free New Zealand White rabbits inoculated with five strains of amyxomatous myxoma virus. All five strains induced the characteristic amyxomatous myxomatosis clinical syndrome with clinical signs that differed only in intensity. The varying clinical intensity, together with the results of virological examination question the virulence of at least three of the five strains. Genomic analysis confirmed that the five strains came from the Lausanne strain introduced in 1952 in France and not from an unnoticed introduction of a Californian strain of myxoma virus. No link was found between the amyxomatous myxoma virus strains and the SG33 vaccine strain. 1999 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

"Primary woodchuck (Marmota monax) hepatocytes from normal woodchucks and woodchucks with chronic woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) infection were cultured in either a conventional serum-containing medium or a serum-free medium. The de novo synthesis of the plasma proteins albumin, transferrin, fibrinogen, and complement C3 were identical under both conditions. However, expression of the WHV and the synthesis of nitric oxide were diminished under serum-free conditions. Primary woodchuck hepatocytes cultured in conventional, serum-containing medium were immortalized utilizing the simian virus 40 T antigen oncogene. Immortalized hepatic cell lines retained differentiated functions of nitric oxide synthesis and expression of complement C3. The woodchuck hepatocyte culture model will supplement current experimental methods, allowing investigation of hepadnaviral pathogenesis, including hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro.

"Pancreatic cancer is often resistant to conventional chemotherapy. In this study, we examined the role of adenovirus-mediated overexpression of E2F-1 in inducing apoptosis and increasing the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents. MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic head exocrine adenocarcinoma cells (mutant p53) were treated by mock infection or adenoviruses expressing beta-galactosidase or E2F-1 (Ad-E2F-1) alone or in combination with sublethal concentrations of each chemotherapeutic drug. Cell growth and viability were assessed at selected time points. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry, characteristic changes in cell morphology and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of E2F-1 and Bcl-2 family member proteins and PARP cleavage. Western blot analysis revealed marked overexpression of E2F-1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 and 70. By 3 days after infection, Ad-E2F-1 treatment at an MOI of 70 resulted in approximately a 20-fold reduction in cell growth and 60% reduction in cell viability as compared to mock-infected cells. Cell cycle analysis, PARP cleavage and changes in cell morphology supported apoptosis as the mechanism of cell death in response to E2F-1. In order to test the efficacy of treatment with a combination of gene therapy and chemotherapy, we utilized concentrations of Ad-E2F-1 which reduced viability to 50% in combination with each chemotherapeutic agent. Cotreatment of the cells with E2F-1 virus and roscovitine (ROS) or etoposide resulted in an additive effect on cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, 5-fluorouracil did not cooperate with Ad-E2F-1 in the mediation of tumor death or inhibition of cell growth. Immunoblotting for Bcl-2 family members revealed no significant changes in the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bcl X(L), Bax or Bak following gene or 'chemogene' therapy with E2F-1. However, a Bax cleavage product was noted which was substantially increased by cotreatment with ROS or etoposide. E2F-1 overexpression initiates apoptosis and suppresses growth in pancreatic MIA PaCa-2 cells in vitro. E2F-1-mediated apoptosis was not associated with significant changes in the expression of Bcl-2 family member proteins in these pancreatic cancer cells. ROS and etoposide, when combined with E2F-1 overexpression, induce apoptosis in an additive manner. This chemogene combination may provide a potentially useful therapeutic strategy for advanced pancreatic cancer.

"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The aerial parts of Senecio scandens Buch.-Ham. (family Asteraceae) have a long history in traditional Chinese medicine as a treatment for various ailments, such as bacterial diarrhea, enteritis, conjunctivitis, and respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bibliographic investigation of Senecio scandens was accomplished by analyzing secondary sources, including the Chinese Medicinal plantal Classics, the Internet (Google Scholar and Baidu Scholar), and scientific databases accepted worldwide (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, SciFinder, and CNKI). These sources were scrutinized for available information about the uses of Senecio scandens in traditional Chinese medicine, phytochemistry, pharmacology, and toxicology. RESULTS: Senecio scandens is a medicinal plant with a climbing woody stem. Phytochemical studies have shown the presence of numerous valuable compounds, such as flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic acids, terpenes, volatile oils, carotenoids, and trace elements. Among them, PAs are the characteristic constituents, adonifoline is one of the index ingredients of Senecio scandens. Studies in modern pharmacology have demonstrated that extracts and compounds isolated from Senecio scandens show a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-leptospirosis, hepatoprotective, anti-infusorial, antioxidant, antiviral, antitumoral, analgesic, mutagenic, and toxicological activities. CONCLUSIONS: Phytochemical and pharmacological studies have demonstrated that the extracts of the plant possess various pharmacological activities that can be attributed to the presence of various flavonoids, phenolic acids, and alkaloids. Newer technologies for qualitative and quantitative methods of PAs need to be developed to obtain better accuracy and sensitivity. Due to the toxicity of PAs present in this medicinal plant, the regulations on PAs of Senecio scandens were varied among different countries and regions. In China, the PAs toxicity of Senecio scandens ranking criteria is not well defined in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010, and there is no strict uniform requirement on the PAs in western countries. We propose that the use of Senecio scandens should be reevaluated based on a set of criteria, which includes risk-benefit analysis and severity of the toxic effects, clinical and preclinical data to ensure safe use while continuing to satisfy the need for access to the medicinal plant.

"Inflammation is a common characteristic of spinal cord injury. The nature of this response, whether it is beneficial or detrimental, has been the subject of debate. It has been reported that susceptibility to autoimmunity is correlated with increased functional impairment following spinal cord injury. As the ability to mount an autoimmune response has most consistently been associated with certain haplotypes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), we analysed the possible effects of the MHC haplotype on functional impairment and recovery following spinal cord injury. A contusion injury was induced in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-susceptible and -resistant rats [Dark Agouti, Lewis and Piebald Viral Glaxo (PVG), respectively]. We found that locomotion recovered significantly better in Dark Agouti rats compared with PVG and Lewis rats but an F2 intercross (PVG x PVG-RT1(av1)) excluded the possibility that this difference was MHC haplotype-dependent. Thus, we conclude that recovery following spinal cord injury is subject to considerable genetic heterogeneity that is not coupled to the MHC haplotype region. Continued research of genetic variants regulating recovery following spinal cord injury is warranted.

"Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of immune responses. Hence, we evaluated the effects of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector 1 (rAAV1) encoding rat IL-10 (rAAV1-IL-10) in a rat model of kidney allograft rejection. Dark Agouti rat kidneys were transplanted into Wistar-Furth (WF) rats 8 weeks following a single intramuscular administration of either rAAV1-IL-10 or rAAV1-green fluorescence protein (GFP). Isografts (WF-WF) served as an additional experimental control. Both allograft and isograft recipients received daily cyclosporine (10 mg/kg) for 14 days after transplantation. Serum IL-10 levels increased at 8, 12 and 16 weeks following vector administration in rAAV1-IL-10-treated animals, but not in rAAV1-GFP and isograft groups. rAAV1-IL-10 treatment resulted in lower BUN and creatinine levels (p<0.001), as well as increased allograft survival rates from 22% to 90%. Allograft histological abnormalities were significantly attenuated in the rAAV1-IL-10-treated rats compared with those of rAAV1-GFP controls. Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as growth-related oncogene were also significantly higher in the rAAV1-GFP group than in the rAAV1-IL-10 group. These data suggest delivery of IL-10 using a rAAV1 vector improves renal function and prolongs graft survival in a rat model of kidney transplant rejection.

"Zika virus is an arbovirus of the Flaviviridae family. It is primarily a minimally symptomatic mosquito-borne infection. However, with Zika's 2015 to 2016 introduction into the Western Hemisphere and its dramatic and rapid spread, it has become a public health concern, in large part due to congenital abnormalities associated with infection in pregnant women. In early 2016, the World Health Organization declared the microcephaly and other neurologic conditions associated with Zika virus infection a public health emergency of international concern. This article discusses the current epidemiologic and clinical understanding of Zika virus, focusing on critical information needed by emergency providers.

"Human hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a serious public health threat with high infection rates in children and infants who reside in Asia and the Pacific regions, and no effective drugs are currently available. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 are the major etiological pathogens. Based on an essential hydrophobic pocket on the viral capsid protein VP1, we designed and synthesized a series of small molecular weight compounds as inhibitors of EV71. A potential drug candidate named NLD-22 exhibited excellent antiviral activity (with an EC(50) of 5.056 nM and a 100% protection rate for mice at a dose of 20 mg/kg) and low toxicity. NLD-22 had a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. High-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structural analysis confirmed NLD-22 bound to the hydrophobic pocket in VP1 to block viral infection. In general, NLD-22 was indicated to be a promising potential drug candidate for the treatment of HFMD.

"Hantaviruses (Bunyaviridae) cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Eurasia and hantavirus (cardio)pulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in the Americas. HFRS is caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV), Seoul virus (SEOV), Dobrava virus (DOBV), Saaremaa virus (SAAV), and Puumala virus (PUUV). Of those, only HTNV is not present in Europe. In recent years, hantaviruses, described in other parts of Europe, were also detected at various locations in Hungary. To study the genetic properties of Hungarian hantaviruses in detail, sequences of the viral S and M segments were recovered from bank voles (Myodes glareolus), yellow-necked mice (Apodemus flavicollis), and striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) trapped in the Transdanubian region. As expected, the sequences recovered belonged, respectively, to PUUV (two strains), DOBV (one strain), and SAAV (one strain). On phylogenetic trees two new Hungarian PUUV strains located within the well- supported Alpe-Adrian (ALAD) genetic lineage that included also Austrian, Slovenian, and Croatian strains. Analysis of the Hungarian SAAV and DOBV genetic variants showed host-specific clustering and also geographical clustering within each of these hantavirus species. Hungarian SAAV and DOBV strains were related most closely to strains from Slovenia (Prekmurje region). This study confirms that multiple hantaviruses can co-circulate in the same locality and can be maintained side-by-side in different rodent species.

"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) represent a superfamily of proteins that mediate the function of neurotransmitters and peptide hormones and are involved in viral entry and perception of light, smell, and taste. GPCRs are characterized by the presence of seven transmembrane domains (TMs). We demonstrate here that structural analogs of individual TMs of GPCRs can serve as potent and specific receptor antagonists. Peptides derived from the transmembrane regions of CXCR4 and CCR5 chemokine receptors specifically inhibited receptor signaling and the in vitro replication of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) at concentrations as low as 0.2 microM. Similarly, peptides mimicking the TMs of cholecystokinin receptor A, were found to abolish ligand binding and signaling through the receptor. Negative charges positioned at the extracellular termini of peptide antagonists appeared to be important for correct spontaneous insertion of the compounds into the cell membrane and for their activity. Targeting of the specific interactions between transmembrane domains of GPCRs is suggested as a general sequence-based method to disrupt receptor function for application in drug design and for structure-function studies of the receptors.

"Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is the European version of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. NE is caused by the Puumala type of Hantavirus with the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) as the natural reservoir. Endemic regions include northern Sweden with an incidence of 53 to 569 cases per year, depending on the cyclic variation of rodent populations. In southern Sweden, south of the Mälardalen region, no cases of NE have been described without a historical account of travel to endemic areas in the weeks beforehand. This case report describes the course of disease of a patient diagnosed with NE, who had only stayed in the southernmost region of Sweden: Skåne. This may indicate the spread of NE to more southern regions of Sweden. NE should consequently be considered as a differential diagnosis at emergency and infectious disease departments throughout Sweden.

"Current methods for dengue virus quantitation are either time consuming, technically demanding or costly. As an alternative, the commercial enzyme immunoassay Platelia Dengue NS1 AG (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was used to monitor semiquantitatively dengue virus replication in cultured cells. The presence of NS1 protein was evaluated in supernatants from Vero and C6/36 HT cells infected with dengue virus. The amount of NS1 detected in the supernatants of infected cells was proportional to the initial MOI used and to the time of post infection harvest. This immunoassay was also able to detect the presence of NS1 in the supernatants of infected human macrophages. Inhibition of dengue virus replication in C6/36 HT cells treated with lysosomotropic drugs was readily monitored with the use of this assay. These results suggest that the Platelia Dengue NS1 AG kit can be used as a fast and reliable surrogate method for the relative quantitation of dengue virus replication in cultured cells.

"BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one tick-transmitted disease where the human incidence has increased in some European regions during the last two decades. We aim to find the most important factors causing the increasing incidence of human TBE in Sweden. Based on a review of published data we presume that certain temperature-related variables and the population densities of transmission hosts, i.e. small mammals, and of primary tick maintenance hosts, i.e. cervids and lagomorphs, of the TBE virus vector Ixodes ricinus, are among the potentially most important factors affecting the TBE incidence. Therefore, we compare hunting data of the major tick maintenance hosts and two of their important predators, and four climatic variables with the annual numbers of human cases of neuroinvasive TBE. Data for six Swedish regions where human TBE incidence is high or has recently increased are examined by a time-series analysis. Results from the six regions are combined using a meta-analytical method. RESULTS: With a one-year time lag, the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), mountain hare (Lepus timidus) and European hare (Lepus europaeus) showed positive covariance; the Eurasian elk (moose, Alces alces) and fallow deer (Dama dama) negative covariance; whereas the wild boar (Sus scrofa), lynx (Lynx lynx), red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the four climate parameters showed no significant covariance with TBE incidence. All game species combined showed positive covariance. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemiology of TBE varies with time and geography and depends on numerous factors, i.a. climate, virus genotypes, and densities of vectors, tick maintenance hosts and transmission hosts. This study suggests that the increased availability of deer to I. ricinus over large areas of potential tick habitats in southern Sweden increased the density and range of I. ricinus and created new TBEV foci, which resulted in increased incidence of human TBE. New foci may be established by TBE virus-infected birds, or by birds or migrating mammals infested with TBEV-infected ticks. Generally, persistence of TBE virus foci appears to require presence of transmission-competent small mammals, especially mice (Apodemus spp.) or bank voles (Myodes glareolus).

"Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are the principal vector for Borrelia burgdorferi, among other infectious agents, in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and upper midwestern USA. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) are the primary and most competent reservoir host of B. burgdorferi in the Northeast. Live reservoir-targeted vaccines (RTVs) to limit enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi were previously developed and successfully evaluated in laboratory and controlled field trials. A novel, inactivated RTV was developed to minimize regulatory and market challenges facing previous RTVs based on live bacterial or viral vehicles. Thirty-two residential properties in Redding, Connecticut, participated in a field trial of an orally delivered, inactivated RTV efficacy study (2015-2016). During the two-year vaccination period, a significant decrease in the percentage of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis larvae parasitizing P. leucopus was observed, as was a significant reduction in the percentage of infected P. leucopus on RTV-treated properties when compared to control properties. This novel inactivated RTV was effective in reducing numbers of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi-infected P. leucopus on properties where it was distributed.

"Naturally occurring bovine-human reassortant rotaviruses with a P[11] VP4 genotype exhibit a tropism for neonates. Interaction of the VP8* domain of the spike protein VP4 with sialic acid was thought to be the key mediator for rotavirus infectivity. However, recent studies have indicated a role for nonsialylated glycoconjugates, including histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), in the infectivity of human rotaviruses. We sought to determine if the bovine rotavirus-derived VP8* of a reassortant neonatal G10P[11] virus interacts with hitherto uncharacterized glycans. In an array screen of >600 glycans, VP8* P[11] showed specific binding to glycans with the Galβ1-4GlcNAc motif, which forms the core structure of type II glycans and is the precursor of H type II HBGA. The specificity of glycan binding was confirmed through hemagglutination assays; GST-VP8* P[11] hemagglutinates type O, A, and B red blood cells as well as pooled umbilical cord blood erythrocytes. Further, G10P[11] infectivity was significantly enhanced by the expression of H type II HBGA in CHO cells. The bovine-origin VP4 was confirmed to be essential for this increased infectivity, using laboratory-derived reassortant viruses generated from sialic acid binding rotavirus SA11-4F and a bovine G10P[11] rotavirus, B223. The binding to a core glycan unit has not been reported for any rotavirus VP4. Core glycan synthesis is constitutive in most cell types, and modification of these glycans is thought to be developmentally regulated. These studies provide the first molecular basis for understanding neonatal rotavirus infections, indicating that glycan modification during neonatal development may mediate the age-restricted infectivity of neonatal viruses.

"Viruses in the Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family are arthropod-transmitted and contribute to staggering numbers of human infections and significant deaths annually across the globe. To identify cellular factors with antiviral activity against flaviviruses, we screened a cDNA library using an iterative approach. We identified a mammalian Hsp40 chaperone protein (DNAJC14) that when overexpressed was able to mediate protection from yellow fever virus (YFV)-induced cell death. Further studies revealed that DNAJC14 inhibits YFV at the step of viral RNA replication. Since replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), a member of the related Pestivirus genus, is also known to be modulated by DNAJC14, we tested the effect of this host factor on diverse Flaviviridae family members. Flaviviruses, including the pathogenic Asibi strain of YFV, Kunjin, and tick-borne Langat virus, as well as a Hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), all were inhibited by overexpression of DNAJC14. Mutagenesis showed that both the J-domain and the C-terminal domain, which mediates self-interaction, are required for anti-YFV activity. We found that DNAJC14 does not block YFV nor HCV NS2-3 cleavage, and using non-inhibitory mutants demonstrate that DNAJC14 is recruited to YFV replication complexes. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that endogenous DNAJC14 rearranges during infection and is found in replication complexes identified by dsRNA staining. Interestingly, silencing of endogenous DNAJC14 results in impaired YFV replication suggesting a requirement for DNAJC14 in YFV replication complex assembly. Finally, the antiviral activity of overexpressed DNAJC14 occurs in a time- and dose-dependent manner. DNAJC14 overexpression may disrupt the proper stoichiometry resulting in inhibition, which can be overcome upon restoration of the optimal ratios due to the accumulation of viral nonstructural proteins. Our findings, together with previously published work, suggest that the members of the Flaviviridae family have evolved in unique and important ways to interact with this host Hsp40 chaperone molecule.

"The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (RB) is a transcriptional modulator. One of the targets for this modulator effect is the AP-1 binding site within the c-jun and collagenase promoters. The physical interactions between RB and c-Jun were demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of these two proteins using anti-c-Jun or anti-RB antisera, glutathione S-transferase affinity matrix binding assays in vitro, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The C-terminal site of the leucine zipper of c-Jun mediated the interaction with RB. Although the B-pocket domain of RB alone bound to c-Jun, a second c-Jun binding site in the RB was also suggested. Mammalian two-hybrid-based assay provided corroborative evidence that transactivation of gene expression by RB required the C-terminal region of c-Jun. We conclude that RB enhances transcription activity mediated through the AP-1 binding site. Adenovirus E1A or human papillomavirus E7 inhibits RB-mediated transcription activity. These data reveal that the interactions between these two distinct classes of oncoproteins RB and c-Jun may be involved in controlling cell growth and differentiation mediated by transcriptional regulation.

"BACKGROUND: Following the 2009 influenza pandemic, several studies showed that the mortality pattern associated with the A(H1N1)2009 virus primarily affected children and young adults. In this study, we aimed to estimate the influenza-attributable deaths during the periods from 1999 to 2010, in the Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur (PACA) region of south-eastern France in order to corroborate the hypothesis that (i) influenza-attributable deaths caused by A(H1N1)2009 strain were much lower than initially expected. METHODS: In order to compare our results with published data, we used the same statistical model of an Austrian team, using a Poisson model adjusted on co-circulating respiratory syncytial virus to explain the weekly mortality. RESULTS: We assessed that 5.7% of the respiratory deaths were attributable to influenza virus during the 2009-2010 pandemic season. This mortality was lower than that observed during the ten preceding epidemic periods (13.8% on average). Age group-based analysis revealed that during the pandemic period, the groups under 65 had a systematically higher excess of respiratory mortality while the age group over 65 had a much lower mortality than during the seasonal epidemic seasons. Similarly, among the less specific outcome (non violent and cardiovascular mortality) the age groups over 45 had higher excess of mortality during the seasonal epidemics than during the pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS: Since most of the influenza mortality is commonly observed in the elderly group (>65 year-old), the moderate elderly mortality during the 2009 pandemic period has impacted the total mortality, and has resulted in a reduced total mortality despite an increased mortality in the young age group. Despite using identical parameters and the same approach as in a previously published study using an Austrian population sample, we observed a lower excess respiratory mortality in the south-eastern France than in Vienna. Thus, the pandemic virus caused less death than the epidemic viruses that circulated during the preceding years. In contrast with catastrophic predictions made in the early phase of the pandemic, human lives were saved during the circulation period of A(H1N1)2009 virus, resulting in a lower overall mortality.

"Heat shock protein (HSP)-peptide complexes from tumor cells elicit specific protective immunity when injected into inbred mice bearing the same specific type of tumor. The HSP-mediated specific immunogenicity also occurs with virus-infected cells. The immune response is solely due to endogenous peptides noncovalently bound to HSP. A vesicular stomatitis virus capsid-derived peptide ligand bearing a photoreactive azido group was specifically bound by and cross-linked to murine HSP glycoprotein (gp) 96. The peptide-binding site was mapped by specific proteolysis of the cross-links followed by analysis of the cross-linked peptides using a judicious combination of SDS-gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and amino acid sequencing. The minimal peptide-binding site was mapped to amino acid residues 624-630 in a highly conserved region of gp96. A model of the peptide binding pocket of gp96 was constructed based on the known crystallographic structure of major histocompatibility complex class I molecule bound to a similar peptide. The gp96-peptide model predicts that the peptide ligand is held in a groove formed by alpha-helices and lies on a surface consisting of antiparallel beta-sheets. Interestingly, in this model, the peptide binding pocket abuts the dimerization domain of gp96, which may have implications for the extraordinary stability of peptide-gp96 complexes, and for the faithful relay of peptides to major histocompatibility complex class I molecule for antigen presentation.

"Nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks were collected from several sites in Rhode Island. DNA was extracted from a subset of these ticks, and PCR and DNA sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene were used to determine the ratio of Anaplasma phagocytophila-human agent (AP-ha) to a genetic variant not associated with human disease (AP-Variant 1). The remaining ticks were allowed to feed to repletion on either white-footed (Peromyscus leucopus) or DBA/2 (Mus musculus) mice. The engorged ticks, and blood samples drawn from each mouse at one-week intervals, were evaluated by PCR and DNA sequencing for the presence of AP-ha and Variant 1. Although a high percentage of the infecting ticks harbored AP-Variant 1, only AP-ha was amplified from the mouse blood samples. Because the A. phagocytophila variant did not establish an infection either in the natural reservoir of AP-ha, the white-footed mouse, or in a common research laboratory mouse (DBA/2), AP-Variant 1 may have an alternative natural reservoir, possibly the white-tailed deer.

"The arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus comprises two antagonistic neuron populations critical for energy balance, namely, the anorexigenic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and the orexigenic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons that act as agonists and antagonists, respectively, for neurons expressing the type IV melanocortin receptor (MC4R) (Andermann ML and Lowell BB. Neuron 95: 757-778, 2017). MC4R activation increases energy expenditure and decreases food intake during positive energy balance states to prevent diet-induced obesity (DIO). Work from our group identified aberrant neuronal cell cycle events both as a novel biomarker and druggable target in the ARC for the treatment of DIO, demonstrating pharmacological restoration of retinoblastoma protein function in the ARC using cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors could treat DIO in mice by increasing lipid oxidation to selectively decrease fat mass. However, the role of CDK4/6 inhibitors on food intake was not examined. Four-week-old Mc4r-lox(TB) mice were continuously administered high-fat diet (60% kcal fat). At 8 wk of age, animals were administered 60 mg/kg abemaciclib orally or a saline control and monitored every 2 wk for fat mass changes by MRI. At 11 wk of age, all animals were injected bilaterally in the paraventricular hypothalamus with AAV8 serotype virus expressing a Cre-mCherry and monitored for another 5 wk. Restoration of Mc4r expression in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN/PVH) reduced food intake in hyperphagic obese mice when given CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy. The reduced food intake was responsible for reduced fat mass in mice treated with abemaciclib. These results indicate that targeting POMC neurons could be an effective strategy in treating diet-related obesity.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We have defined some of the necessary components to prevent high-fat diet-induced obesity at the molecular and cellular level. Within POMC neurons, the retinoblastoma protein must remain active and prevented from phosphoinactivation by cyclin-dependent kinases. The downstream neurons within the PVH must also properly express MC4R for the circuit to appropriately regulate feeding behavior.

"The rabbit caliciviruses Lagovirus europaeus GI.1 and GI.2 both cause acute necrotizing hepatitis in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Whilst GI.2 is highly virulent in both young and adult rabbits, rabbits younger than eight weeks of age are highly resistant to disease caused by GI.1, although they are still permissive to infection and viral replication. To investigate the underlying mechanism(s) of this age related resistance to GI.1, we compared liver transcriptomes of young rabbits infected with GI.1 to those of adult rabbits infected with GI.1 and young rabbits infected with GI.2. Our data suggest that kittens have constitutively heightened innate immune responses compared to adult rabbits, particularly associated with increased expression of major histocompatibility class II molecules and activity of natural killer cells, macrophages, and cholangiocytes. This enables them to respond more rapidly to GI.1 infection than adult rabbits and thus limit virus-induced pathology. In contrast, these responses were not fully developed during GI.2 infection. We speculate that the observed downregulation of multiple genes associated with innate immunity in kittens during GI.2 infection may be due to virally-mediated immunomodulation, permitting fatal disease to develop. Our study provides insight into the fundamental host⁻pathogen interactions responsible for the differences in age-related susceptibility, which likely plays a critical role in defining the success of GI.2 in outcompeting GI.1 in the field.

"Combined active and passive immunization has been established to be an optimal strategy for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Prompt administration of vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) can reliably prevent the disease. However, RIG is unavailable and unaffordable in the majority of cases. On the basis of a model experiment using hamsters, we demonstrated that vaccine injection at the wound site in the same manner as administration of RIG provided protective efficacy that was not inferior to the current optimal PEP, a combination of vaccination and RIG. Further study is needed to determine whether it can replace the use of RIG.

"Bartonella species were isolated from the blood of 63 of 325 Rattus norvegicus and 11 of 92 Rattus rattus from 13 sites in the United States and Portugal. Infection in both Rattus species ranged from 0% (e.g., 0/87) to approximately 60% (e.g., 35/62). A 337-bp fragment of the citrate synthase (gltA) gene amplified by polymerase chain reaction was sequenced from all 74 isolates. Isolates from R. norvegicus were most similar to Bartonella elizabethae, isolated previously from a patient with endocarditis (93%-100% sequence similarity), followed by Bartonella grahamii and other Bartonella species isolated from Old World rodents (Clethrionomys species, Mus musculus, and Rattus species). These data suggest that Rattus species are a reservoir host for pathogenic Bartonella species and are consistent with a hypothesized Old World origin for Bartonella species recovered from Rattus species introduced into the Americas.

"BACKGROUND: Although enterovirus 71 (EV71) is an important public health threat, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, there are still no effective drugs or vaccines to treat and prevent EV71 infection. Therefore, it is critical to develop prophylactic and therapeutic agents against EV71. Rosmarinic acid (RA), a phytochemical, has been discovered to possess a broad spectrum of biological activities. METHODS: The virucidal effects of RA on EV71 were determined by MTT, western blot, median cell culture infectious dose, apoptosis detection, plaque reduction, semi-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence detection, molecular docking analysis, and mouse protection assay. RESULTS: RA showed a strong protective effect against EV71 infection in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells when the multiplicity of infection was 1, with a low IC(50) value (4.33 ± 0.18 μM) and high therapeutic index (340). RA not only protected cells from EV71-induced cytopathic effects, but also from EV71-induced apoptosis. The results of time-of-addition analysis demonstrated that the inhibitory activity of RA was highest at the early stage of viral infection. Consistent with this, the infectivity of EV71 in the early stage of viral infection also was observed to be limited in neonatal mice treated with RA. Further, molecular docking predicts that RA could replace the natural pocket factor within the VP1 capsid-binding hydrophobic pocket. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that RA has the potential to be developed as an antiviral agent against initial EV71 infection to prevent or reduce EV71-induced pathogenesis and complications, since RA can effectively reduce EV71 infection in the early stages of viral infection.

"Plant 90kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) is a potent adjuvant that increases both humoral and cellular immune responses to diverse proteins and peptides. In this study, we explored whether Arabidopsis thaliana HSP90 (AtHsp81.2) can improve the immune effects of a Toxoplasma gondii surface antigen 1 (SAG1). We designed two constructs containing the sequence of mature antigen (SAG1(m)), from aa(77) to aa(322,) and B- and T-cell antigenic epitope-containing SAG1(HC), from aa(221) to aa(319) fused to AtHsp81.2 sequence. When comparing the transient expression in Nicotiana tabacum X-27-8 leaves, which overexpress the suppressor helper component protease HC-Pro-tobacco etch virus (TEV), to that in N. benthamiana leaves, co-agroinfiltrated with the suppressor p19, optimal conditions included 6-week-old N. benthamiana plants, 7-day time to harvest, Agrobacterium tumefaciens cultures with an OD(600nm) of 0.6 for binary vectors and LED lights. While AtHsp81.2-SAG1(m) fusion protein was undetectable by Western blot in any of the evaluated conditions, AtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC) was expressed as intact fusion protein, yielding up to 90μg/g of fresh weight. Besides, the AtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC) mRNA was strongly expressed compared to the endogenous Nicotiana tabacum elongation factor-alpha (NtEFα) gene, whereas the AtHsp81.2-SAG1(m) mRNA was almost undetectable. Finally, mice were orally immunized with AtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC)-infiltrated fresh leaves (plAtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC) group), recombinant AtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC) purified from infiltrated leaves (rAtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC) group), non-infiltrated fresh leaves (control group), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS group). Serum samples from plAtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC)-immunized mice had significantly higher levels of IgGt, IgG2a, and IgG2b anti-SAG1(HC) antibodies than serum from rAtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC), control, and PBS groups. The number of cysts per brain in the plAtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC)-immunized mice was significantly reduced, and the parasite load in brain tissue was also lower in this group compared with the remaining groups. In an immunoblot assay, plant-expressed AtHsp81.2-SAG1(HC) was shown to react with antibodies present in sera from T. gondii-infected people. Therefore, the plant expression of a T. gondii antigen fused to the non-pathogenic adjuvant and carrier plant HSP90 as formulations against T. gondii can improve the vaccine efficacy, and plant extract can be directly used for vaccination without the need to purify the protein, making this platform a suitable and powerful biotechnological system for immunogenic antigen expression against toxoplasmosis.

"Background and aimsSeasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) uptake (SIVU) rates in France are below target. We (i) describe trends in French SIVU over 10 consecutive seasons among different target groups and (ii) examine the effects of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic and the publication of new SIV recommendations in 2011 and 2013.MethodsOur study was based on records of vaccines delivered in community pharmacies for a permanent, representative sample of 805,000 beneficiaries of the French National Health Insurance Fund. For the first objective, we analysed SIVU rate trends among ≥ 65 year olds as well as among  < 65 year olds with each of the following conditions: diabetes, respiratory, cardiovascular, neuromuscular, or chronic liver disease. For the second goal, we computed segmented log-binomial regression analyses.ResultsAfter the 2009 pandemic, except for the target group with liver diseases, where the difference was not statistically significant, SIVU fell significantly in all groups during the 2010/11 season, remaining relatively stable until 2015/16 in groups not targeted by new recommendations. Crude SIVU rates in 2015/16 were 48% (43,950/91,794) for ≥ 65 year olds and between 16% (407/2,565) and 29% (873/3,056) for  < 65 year olds depending on their condition. SIVU increased modestly after new recommendations were published, but only in patients newly eligible for a free vaccine voucher.ConclusionsOur results suggest: (i) a prolonged confidence crisis in SIV, initially impelled by the 2009 pandemic vaccination campaign; (ii) that new recommendations are ineffective without additional measures. Interventional research in this field is a priority.

"Latent periods and cumulative incidence of mammary carcinomas (MT) up to 50 wk after initial gavage with 7.12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) were determined in virgin yellow (Avy/A) and agouti (A/a) (BALB/cStCrlfC3Hf/Nctr X VY/WffC3Hf/Nctr-Avy) F1 hybrid female mice. When subcutaneous masses reached 5-10 mm in diameter, the mice were killed and necropsied, and the tissues examined histologically. No MT were found in control mice. Cumulative MT incidence in the 1.5-mg DMBA group (A) was 43% (41/95) among yellow mice, and 33% (32/96) among agoutis. In the 6.0-mg DMBA group (B), corresponding MT incidences were 86% (83/96) and 71% (67/95). In group A, the first percentile of MT detection was 13.0 wk after initial carcinogen treatment in yellow mice; it was 18.0 wk in agoutis. Corresponding latent periods for the 20th percentile were 34.3 and 47.0 wk. In group B, latencies for the first percentile were 8.3 and 9.0 wk. Corresponding latencies for the 20th percentile were 15.3 and 16.0 wk. Within genotypes and dose groups, rates of weight gain of mice that developed MT and those that did not were similar. We conclude that MT induced by low doses of DMBA arise more rapidly in yellow mice than in nonyellow littermates. The absence of spontaneous MTs, acceleration of chemically induced MT formation at a low dose level that does not induce general toxicity, and availability of genetically identical (except for one gene) normal control animals make this experimental system suitable for development of an assay to efficiently test the carcinogenic potential of low dose levels of chemical substances.

"Thirty-three woodchucks were used in this study. Seventeen animals were healthy adults, not infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV); 10 were healthy adults infected with WHV; 4 were noninfected neonates; 2 were infected neonates. Within the 4 groups of woodchucks, no histologic differences were detected on the basis of sex or age. Neither were histologic findings different between infected and noninfected woodchucks of similar ages. The average thickness of skin (as measured from the skin surface to the inner limit of the dermis) from the general haired body area was 2394 microns. The skin was thickest on dorsal body areas, and gradually became thinner on ventral body and medial limb areas. The epidermis consisted of 4 layers: stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, and stratum corneum. A stratum lucidum was present only in the epidermis of the footpads. There was no clear distinction between the superficial dermis and the deep dermis, except for the subtle differences in arrangement and size of collagen fibers. Elastic fibers were seen throughout the dermis, being more prominent in the superficial portion. Both compound and simple hair follicle arrangements were seen, with compound being more common. The arrectores pilorum muscles were largest in the skin over the dorsal body areas. Sebaceous glands were present either within the outer root sheath of hair follicles or in the dense connective tissue surrounding hair follicles. No apocrine sweat glands were found. However, there were abundant eccrine sweat glands in the subcutaneous fat of the footpads.

"An 11-year retrospective study was conducted on the dermatoses occurring in 113 woodchucks from a colony at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Cornell University. Bacterial dermatitis was the most common dermatologic disorder, accounting for 70.2% of the cases. The highest incidence of bacterial dermatitis occurred in September/October prior to hibernation and in February/March during the breeding season. Other dermatoses observed during the study period included Taenia crassiceps infection, microfilarial dermatitis, telogen defluxion, various neoplastic and hyperplastic lesions, and various neonatal conditions associated with trauma and/or bacterial infection. No association was found between any of these dermatoses and the presence of woodchuck hepatitis virus infection.

"Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continue to pose an imminent threat to humans due to annual influenza epidemic outbreaks and episodic pandemics with high mortality rates. In this context, the suboptimal vaccine coverage and efficacy, coupled with recurrent events of viral resistance against a very limited antiviral portfolio, emphasize an urgent need for new additional prophylactic and therapeutic options, including new antiviral targets and drugs with new mechanisms of action to prevent and treat influenza virus infection. Here, we characterized a novel influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP) inhibitor, FA-6005, that inhibited a broad spectrum of human pandemic and seasonal influenza A and B viruses in vitro and protects mice against lethal influenza A virus challenge. The small molecule FA-6005 targeted a conserved NP I41 domain and acted as a potentially broad, multimechanistic anti-influenza virus therapeutic since FA-6005 suppressed influenza virus replication and perturbed intracellular trafficking of viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) from early to late stages. Cocrystal structures of the NP/FA-6005 complex reconciled well with concurrent mutational studies. This study provides the first line of direct evidence suggesting that the newly identified NP I41 pocket is an attractive target for drug development that inhibits multiple functions of NP. Our results also highlight FA-6005 as a promising candidate for further development as an antiviral drug for the treatment of IAV infection and provide chemical-level details for inhibitor optimization.IMPORTANCE Current influenza antivirals have limitations with regard to their effectiveness and the potential emergence of resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for broad-spectrum inhibitors to address the considerable challenges posed by the rapid evolution of influenza viruses that limit the effectiveness of vaccines and lead to the emergence of antiviral drug resistance. Here, we identified a novel influenza A virus NP antagonist, FA-6005, with broad-spectrum efficacy against influenza viruses, and our study presents a comprehensive study of the mode of action of FA-6005 with the crystal structure of the compound in complex with NP. The influenza virus inhibitor holds promise as an urgently sought-after therapeutic option offering a mechanism of action complementary to existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza virus infection and should further aid in the development of universal therapeutics.

"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among people who inject drugs (PWID) and is associated with morbidity and premature death. Although HCV can be cured, treatment may be inaccessible. We studied HCV testing, status and treatment among marginalized people who use drugs in Ottawa, Canada, a setting with universal insurance coverage for physician services. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Participatory Research in Ottawa: Understanding Drugs study, a cross-sectional, peer-administered survey of people who use drugs from 2012 to 2013. We linked responses to population-based health administrative databases and used multivariable Poisson regression to identify factors independently associated with self-reported HCV testing, self-reported positive HCV status, and database-determined engagement in HCV treatment. RESULTS: Among 663 participants, 562 (84.8%) reported testing for HCV and 258 (45.9%) reported HCV-positive status. In multivariable analysis, HCV-positive status was associated with female gender (RR 1.27; 95%CI 1.04 to 1.55), advancing age (RR 1.03/year; 95%CI 1.02 to 1.04), receiving disability payments (RR 1.42; 95%CI 1.06 to 1.91), injecting drugs (RR 5.11; 95%CI 2.64 to 9.91), ever injecting with a used needle (RR 1.30; 95%CI 1.12 to 1.52), and ever having taken methadone (RR 1.26; 95%CI 1.05 to 1.52). Of HCV positive participants, 196 (76%) were engaged in primary care but only 23 (8.9%) had received HCV therapy. Conclusions/Importance: Although HCV testing and positive status rates are high among PWID in our study, few have received HCV treatment. Innovative initiatives to increase access to HCV treatment for PWID are urgently needed.

"We have used cDNA clones derived from the genomic S RNA segment of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), Armstrong strain, as hybridization probes to monitor virus gene expression during acute infections. Our results with strand-specific probes confirm the ambisense character of the LCMV S RNA segment and document the presence of both genomic sense and genomic complementary sense RNA species over the time course of infection. We have used nucleotide sequence information to predict primary amino acid sequences for the major viral structural proteins, nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein (GP-C). Antibodies raised against synthetic peptides derived from these predicted protein sequences have indicated that the gene order for the S segment is 3' NP----5' GP-C and provided direct demonstration that the GP-1 portion of the GP-C precursor is encoded nearest the 5' end of the S segment. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences for NP and GP-C between the Armstrong CA-1371 strain and the WE strain shows over 90% amino acid identity. This suggests that significant differences described for the pathogenic potential of the Arm and WE strains in C3H mice reside in one or a very few critical amino acid changes.

"PURPOSE: The Eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) is considered as a naturally occurring animal model of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The performance of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) for imaging HCC on the woodchuck using Positron emission tomography (PET) was investigated in this study. PROCEDURES: Dynamic FDG-PET scans were performed on five woodchucks with HCC and one healthy woodchuck before removal and processing of the liver tissues for histology. The parameters of a two-tissue compartment model with dual input were estimated using weighted least squares (WLS). RESULTS: Ten HCCs were confirmed histologically. Six HCCs had a tumor-to-liver standardized uptake value (SUV) ratio < or =1.15, a k (4) / k (3) ratio similar to that in hepatic tissues and were well-differentiated. Four HCCs had a tumor-to-liver SUV ratio >1.15, a lower k (4) / k (3) ratio than the hepatic tissues and were moderately differentiated. CONCLUSIONS: Increased FDG uptake was observed in HCCs that were the least differentiated and correlated with a lower k (4) / k (3) ratio.

"Vaccination campaigns against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) are commonly used in translocation programs conducted for the purpose of recovering wild European rabbit populations in Iberian Mediterranean ecosystems. In most cases rabbits are vaccinated 'blind' (i.e. without assessing their prior immunological status) for economic and logistic reasons. However, there is conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of such an approach. We tested whether blind vaccination against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease improved rabbit survival in a rabbit translocation program where wild rabbits were kept in semi-natural conditions in three enclosures. We conducted nine capture sessions over two years (2008-2010) and used the information collected to compare the survival of vaccinated (n=511) versus unvaccinated (n=161) adult wild rabbits using capture-mark-recapture analysis. Average monthly survival was no different for vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals, both in the period between release and first capture (short-term) and after the first capture onward (long-term). Rabbit survival was lower in the short term than in the long term regardless of whether rabbits were vaccinated or not. Lower survival in the short-term could be due to the stress induced by the translocation process itself (e.g. handling stress). However, we did not find any overall effect of vaccination on survival which could be explained by two non-exclusive reasons. First, interference of the vaccine with the natural antibodies in the donor population. Due to donor populations have high density of rabbits with, likely, high prevalence of antibodies as a result of previous natural exposure to these diseases. Second, the lack of severe outbreaks during the study period. Based on our findings we argue that blind vaccination of adult rabbits in translocation programs may be often mostly ineffective and unnecessarily costly. In particular, since outbreaks are hard to predict and vaccination of rabbits with natural antibodies is ineffective, it is crucial to assess the immunological status of the donor population before translocating adult rabbits.

"Using a recombinant protein N46FdFc that mimics the HIV-1 gp41 N-helix trimer to immunize mice, we identified the first IgM monoclonal antibody 18D3 that specifically bound to the conserved gp41 pocket. Its F(ab')2 fragment potently inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion and neutralized infection by laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 isolates with different subtypes and tropism, including the T20-resistant variants. This F(ab')2 fragment can be used to develop a bispecific broad neutralizing monoclonal antibody or HIV-1 inactivator as a novel immunotherapeutic for treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection.

"The eastern woodchuck, Marmota monax, represents a useful animal model to study hepatitis B virus infection in humans. However, immunological studies in this model have been impeded by a lack of basic information about the components of the immune system such as cytokines and chemokines. To clarify the role(s) of interleukin 8 (IL-8) in chronic hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the woodchuck model, we cloned and characterized the woodchuck IL-8 cDNA and genomic DNA. Sequence analysis revealed that the organization of the wk-IL-8 gene is similar to that of the human IL-8 gene and consists of four exons and three introns. Woodchuck IL-8 protein exhibits the conserved ELRCXC motif of IL-8 and shows 87, 82, 82 and 79% similarity with rabbit, ovine, bovine and human IL-8 proteins, respectively. The biological activity of wk-IL-8 was demonstrated using neutrophil chemotaxis assays. Wk-IL-8 could be readily detected in both tumor and non-tumor tissues with higher expression in the non-tumor tissues in most cases. The results from this study will facilitate the investigation of IL-8 in the immunopathogenesis of hepadnavirus-related diseases by the woodchuck model.

"Survival of human poliovirus type 1 in a sandy loam soil appeared to be deleteriously influenced by aerobic microorganisms. This effect was determined by comparing the survival of virus in soil under four different possible combinations of aerobic versus anaerobic (H2-CO2) atmosphere and sterile versus nonsterile condition. Storage of samples was done in humid chambers to prevent soil desiccation. The effect attributed to aerobic microorganisms was measurable and statistically significant at all three incubation temperatures used in the study (1, 23, and 37 degrees C), with the increase in inactivation rate attributable to aerobic microorganisms generally being two to threefold. No comparable effect was observed to occur for anaerobic microorganisms under the sets of conditions employed in the study.

"A necessary condition for Rift Valley fever (RVF) emergence is the presence of Aedes (Aedimorphus) vexans and Culex (Culex) poicilipes mosquitoes carrying the arbovirus and responsible for the infection. This paper presents a detailed mapping in the Sahelian region of Senegal of zones potentially occupied by these mosquitoes (ZPOMs) whose population density is directly linked to ecozones in the vicinity of small ponds. The vectors habitats and breeding sites have been characterized through an integrated approach combining remote sensing technology, geographical information systems, geographical positioning systems and field observations for proper geo-referencing. From five SPOT-5 images (approximately 10 m spatial resolution) with appropriate channels, a meridional composite transect of 290 x 60 km was first constructed at the height of the summer monsoon. Subsequent ZPOMs covered major ecozones from north to south with different hydrological environments and different patterns pond distributions. It was found that an overall area of 12,817 ha +/- 10% (about 0.8% of the transect) is occupied by ponds with an average ZPOM 17 times larger than this (212,813 ha +/- 10% or about 14% of the transect). By comparing the very humid year of 2003 with 2006 which had just below normal rainfall, the ZPOMs inter-annual variability was analyzed in a sandy-clayey ecozone with an important hydrofossil riverbed within the Ferlo region of Senegal. Very probably contributing to an increased abundance of vectors by the end of August 2003, it was shown that the aggregate pond area was already about 22 times larger than in August 2006, corresponding to an approximately five times larger total ZPOM. The results show the importance of pin-pointing small ponds (sizes down to 0.1 ha) and their geographical distribution in order to assess animal exposure to the RVF vectors.

"Transmission of hemorrhagic fever New World arenaviruses from their rodent reservoirs to human populations poses substantial public health and economic dangers. These zoonotic events are enabled by the specific interaction between the New World arenaviral attachment glycoprotein, GP1, and cell surface human transferrin receptor (hTfR1). Here, we present the structural basis for how a mouse-derived neutralizing antibody (nAb), OD01, disrupts this interaction by targeting the receptor-binding surface of the GP1 glycoprotein from Junín virus (JUNV), a hemorrhagic fever arenavirus endemic in central Argentina. Comparison of our structure with that of a previously reported nAb complex (JUNV GP1-GD01) reveals largely overlapping epitopes but highly distinct antibody-binding modes. Despite differences in GP1 recognition, we find that both antibodies present a key tyrosine residue, albeit on different chains, that inserts into a central pocket on JUNV GP1 and effectively mimics the contacts made by the host TfR1. These data provide a molecular-level description of how antibodies derived from different germline origins arrive at equivalent immunological solutions to virus neutralization.

"We sought to determine a role for NPY overexpression in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) in obesity etiology using the rat model of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated expression of NPY (AAVNPY) in the DMH. Rats received bilateral DMH injections of AAVNPY or control vector and were fed on regular chow. Five-week postviral injection, half the rats from each group were switched to access to a high-fat diet for another 11 weeks. We examined variables including body weight, food intake, energy efficiency, meal patterns, glucose tolerance, fat mass, plasma insulin, plasma leptin, and hypothalamic gene expression. Rats with DMH NPY overexpression had increased food intake and body weight and lowered metabolic efficiency. The hyperphagia was mediated through increased meal size during the dark. Although these rats had normal blood glucose, their plasma insulin levels were increased in both basal and glucose challenge conditions. While high-fat diet induced hyperphagia, obesity, and hyperinsulinemia, these effects were amplified in rats with DMH NPY overexpression. Arcuate Npy, agouti-related protein and proopiomelanocortin expression was appropriately regulated in response to positive energy balance. These results indicate that DMH NPY overexpression can cause hyperphagia and obesity and DMH NPY may have actions in glucose homeostasis.

"Sindbis virus (SINV) is an alphavirus that causes age-dependent encephalomyelitis in mice. Within 7-8 days after infection infectious virus is cleared from neurons through the antiviral effects of antibody and interferon-gamma (IFNγ), but RNA persists. To better understand changes in viral RNA associated with immune-mediated clearance we developed recombinant strains of SINV that have genomic and subgenomic viral RNAs tagged with the Broccoli RNA aptamer that binds and activates a conditional fluorophore for live cell imaging of RNA. Treatment of SINV-Broccoli-infected cells with antibody to the SINV E2 glycoprotein had cell type-specific effects. In BHK cells, antibody increased levels of intracellular viral RNA and changed the primary location of genomic RNA from the perinuclear region to the plasma membrane without improving cell viability. In undifferentiated and differentiated AP7 (dAP7) neuronal cells, antibody treatment decreased levels of viral RNA. Occasional dAP7 cells escaped antibody-mediated clearance by not expressing cell surface E2 or binding antibody to the plasma membrane. IFNγ decreased viral RNA levels only in dAP7 cells and synergized with antibody for RNA clearance and improved cell survival. Therefore, analysis of aptamer-tagged SINV RNAs identified cell type- and neuronal maturation-dependent responses to immune mediators of virus clearance.

"Sandy surface sediments of tidal flats exhibit high microbial activity due to the fast and deep-reaching transport of oxygen and nutrients by porewater advection. On the other hand during low tide, limited transport results in nutrient and oxygen depletion concomitant to the accumulation of microbial metabolites. This study represents the first attempt to use flow-through reactors to investigate virus production, virus transport and the impact of tides and season in permeable sediments. The reactors were filled with intertidal sands of two sites (North beach site and backbarrier sand flat of Spiekeroog island in the German Wadden Sea) to best simulate advective porewater transport through the sediments. Virus and cell release along with oxygen consumption were measured in the effluents of reactors during continuous flow of water through the sediments as well as in tidal simulation experiments where alternating cycles with and without water flow (each for 6 h) were operated. The results showed net rates of virus production (0.3-13.2 × 10(6) viruses cm(-3) h(-1)) and prokaryotic cell production (0.3-10.0 × 10(5) cells cm(-3) h(-1)) as well as oxygen consumption rates (56-737 μmol l(-1) h(-1)) to be linearly correlated reflecting differences in activity, season and location of the sediments. Calculations show that total virus turnover was fast with 2 to 4 days, whereas virus-mediated cell turnover was calculated to range between 5-13 or 33-91 days depending on the assumed burst sizes (number of viruses released upon cell lysis) of 14 or 100 viruses, respectively. During the experiments, the homogenized sediments in the reactors became vertically structured with decreasing microbial activities and increasing impact of viruses on prokaryotic mortality with depth. Tidal simulation clearly showed a strong accumulation of viruses and cells in the top sections of the reactors when the flow was halted indicating a consistently high virus production during low tide. In conclusion, cell lysis products due to virus production may fuel microbial communities in the absence of advection-driven nutrient input, but are eventually washed off the surface sediment during high tide and being transported into deeper sediment layers or into the water column together with the produced viruses.

"On 1 October 2019, a locally-acquired Zika virus disease case was laboratory confirmed in Hyères, Var department. Active case finding identified two additional locally-acquired cases living within 90 m, with symptom onset 8 days before the index case. Extensive patient interviews did not yield information supporting transmission through sexual contact or substances of human origin. Vector-borne transmission by local Aedes albopictus mosquitoes is the most likely mode of transmission. Here we describe the public health response.

"PURPOSE: To assess the self-reported vaccination behavior of general practitioners (GPs) when asked whether they would recommend the vaccination of a child presenting with a febrile uncomplicated common cold. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey in 2014 on a national sample of GPs. GPs were randomly assigned to one of eight clinical vignettes, all describing a child presenting with an uncomplicated febrile common cold, but differing by age (4 or 11 months), temperature (38°C or 39°C), and the mother's emotional state (calm or worried). GPs were asked whether they would recommend immediate vaccination of the child with a hexavalent vaccine (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and hepatitis B), or postpone it. We investigated the relation between the GPs' recommendation to vaccinate, the clinical vignette's variables, and the GPs' perceptions, attitudes, and practices toward vaccination in a multivariate model. RESULTS: Among the 1582 participating GPs, 6% recommended immediate vaccination. This behavior was more frequent with a temperature of 38°C rather than 39°C (10% vs. 3%, P<0.001). GPs who felt comfortable giving explanations about vaccine safety were more likely to recommend immediate vaccination of the febrile child (P=0.045), but none of the other GPs' characteristics were associated with their vaccination behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all GPs postponed the hexavalent vaccination of the febrile child presenting with an uncomplicated viral disease; fever being the major factor affecting their decision. More research is needed on vaccination responses in sick children, as well as clearer guidelines.

"Monoclonal antibodies (MA) were prepared to two strains of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus: strain 4072 isolated from a patient in the U.S.S.R. and low-pathogenic for mice strain Skalica, isolated from a bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) in Slovakia. MA specific to the 4072 and Skalica strains were produced by hybridomas of the KEN (60 clones) and NEK (65 clones) series, respectively. Chromosomal analysis of MA producing 114 hybridoma clones of both series revealed a great variability in the number of chromosomes either in the range of given clones or between individual clones. The hybridoma cells under study possessed a high degree of transformation manifested by good growth in the mouse peritoneal cavity and marked accumulation in ascitic fluid (AF).

"Influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is a heterotrimer composed of PA, PB1, and PB2 subunits. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is required for both transcription and replication of influenza viral RNA taking place in the nucleus of infected cells. A ""cap-snatching"" mechanism is used to generate a 5'-capped primer for transcription in which the cap-binding domain of PB2 (PB2cap) captures the 5' cap of the host pre-mRNA. Our statistical analysis of PB2 sequences showed that residue Lys(339) located in the cap-binding pocket of H5N1 PB2cap was gradually replaced by Thr(339) over the past decade. To understand the role of this amino acid polymorphism, we solved the crystal structures of PB2cap with or without a pre-mRNA cap analog, m(7)GTP, in the presence of Lys(339) or Thr(339). The structures showed that Lys(339) contributes to binding the γ-phosphate group of m(7)GTP, and the replacement of Lys(339) by Thr eliminates this interaction. Isothermal titration calorimetry analysis showed that Thr(339) attenuated the PB2cap cap binding activity in vitro compared with Lys(339). Further functional studies confirmed that Thr(339)-PB2-containing ribonucleoprotein complex has a reduced influenza polymerase activity and RNA synthesis activity, and a reconstituted H5N1 virus containing the Thr(339) substitution exhibited a lower virulence to mice but more active replication in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. The K339T substitution in the cap-binding pocket of PB2 modulates the polymerase activity and virulence by regulating the cap binding activity. It is informative to track variations in the cap-binding pocket of PB2 in surveillance of the evolution and spread of influenza virus.

"Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) is a member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family and is involved in cytokine signalling. In vitro analyses suggest that TYK2 also has kinase-independent, i.e., non-canonical, functions. We have generated gene-targeted mice harbouring a mutation in the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain. The Tyk2 kinase-inactive (Tyk2(K923E)) mice are viable and show no gross abnormalities. We show that kinase-active TYK2 is required for full-fledged type I interferon- (IFN) induced activation of the transcription factors STAT1-4 and for the in vivo antiviral defence against viruses primarily controlled through type I IFN actions. In addition, TYK2 kinase activity was found to be required for the protein's stability. An inhibitory function was only observed upon over-expression of TYK2(K923E)in vitro. Tyk2(K923E) mice represent the first model for studying the kinase-independent function of a JAK in vivo and for assessing the consequences of side effects of JAK inhibitors.

"H-2Kb and HLA-A2 are MHC4 class I molecules with a similar overall structure. Important differences between these two class I molecules reside in the structure of the individual pockets in the antigenic-peptide-binding groove. H-2Kb, which has a deep C pocket, binds specifically peptides with a tyrosine or a phenylalanine at position 5. In contrast, HLA-A2 has a shallow C pocket, which cannot accommodate large side chains at position 5. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate a chimera between the murine H-2Kb and the human HLA-A2 [H-2Kb/HLA-A2(C')]. The structure of this chimera is similar to H-2Kb except for the region around the deep C pocket, where residues at positions 9, 97 and 99 were substituted with those bulkier residues from HLA-A2. Peptide binding between this chimera and H-2Kb-binding peptides [VSV (52-59), OVA (257-264), and MCMV pp89 (168-176)], revealed that the deep C pocket of H-2Kb was crucial for high-affinity binding. While a peptide, VSV (52-59), was found to bind with severalfold lower 'affinity' to H-2Kb/HLA-A2(C') than to the wild-type H-2Kb, a VSV analogue with the tyrosine in position 5 (Tyr5) substituted with an alanine was found to bind with a similar 'affinity' to both MHC class I molecules. Computer-aided modelling of the H-2Kb/HLA-A2(C') complex indicates that the VSV (52-59) peptide probably binds to the chimeric MHC molecule with the peptide side chain of anchor residue Tyr5 pointing away from the groove. These results confirm a role of the individual pockets in determining peptide-binding affinity and specificity and suggest that this may be accomplished by changes in side-chain orientation.

"Funding for species conservation is insufficient to meet the current challenges facing global biodiversity, yet many programs use expensive single-species recovery actions and neglect broader management that addresses threatening processes. Arid Australia has the world's worst modern mammalian extinction record, largely attributable to competition from introduced herbivores, particularly European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and foxes (Vulpes vulpes). The biological control agent rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) was introduced to Australia in 1995 and resulted in dramatic, widespread rabbit suppression. We compared the area of occupancy and extent of occurrence of 4 extant species of small mammals before and after RHDV outbreak, relative to rainfall, sampling effort, and rabbit and predator populations. Despite low rainfall during the first 14 years after RHDV, 2 native rodents listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the dusky hopping-mouse (Notomys fuscus) and plains mouse (Pseudomys australis), increased their extent of occurrence by 241-365%. A threatened marsupial micropredator, the crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda), underwent a 70-fold increase in extent of occurrence and a 20-fold increase in area of occupancy. Both bottom-up and top-down trophic effects were attributed to RHDV, namely decreased competition for food resources and declines in rabbit-dependent predators. Based on these sustained increases, these 3 previously threatened species now qualify for threat-category downgrading on the IUCN Red List. These recoveries are on a scale rarely documented in mammals and give impetus to programs aimed at targeted use of RHDV in Australia, rather than simply employing top-down threat-based management of arid ecosystems. Conservation programs that take big-picture approaches to addressing threatening processes over large spatial scales should be prioritized to maximize return from scarce conservation funding. Further, these should be coupled with long-term ecological monitoring, a critical tool in detecting and understanding complex ecosystem change.

"The segmented 18.5-kbp dsRNA genome of rotavirus expresses 6 structural and 6 nonstructural proteins. We investigated the possibility of using the recently developed plasmid-based rotavirus reverse genetics (RG) system to generate recombinant viruses that express a separate heterologous protein in addition to the 12 viral proteins. To address this, we replaced the NSP3 open reading frame (ORF) of the segment 7 (pT7/NSP3) transcription vector used in the RG system with an ORF encoding NSP3 fused to a fluorescent reporter protein (i.e., UnaG, mRuby, mKate, or TagBFP). Inserted at the fusion junction was a teschovirus translational 2A stop-restart element designed to direct the separate expression of NSP3 and the fluorescent protein. Recombinant rotaviruses made with the modified pT7/NSP3 vectors were well growing and generally genetically stable, and they expressed NSP3 and a separate fluorescent protein detectable by live cell imaging. NSP3 made by the recombinant viruses was functional, inducing nuclear accumulation of cellular poly(A)-binding protein. Further modification of the NSP3 ORF showed that it was possible to generate recombinant viruses encoding 2 heterologous proteins (mRuby and UnaG) in addition to NSP3. Our results demonstrate that, through modification of segment 7, the rotavirus genome can be increased in size to at least 19.8 kbp and can be used to produce recombinant rotaviruses expressing a full complement of viral proteins and multiple heterologous proteins. The generation of recombinant rotaviruses expressing fluorescent proteins will be valuable for the study of rotavirus replication and pathogenesis by live cell imagining and suggest that rotaviruses will prove useful as expression vectors.IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses are a major cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children. Recently, a highly efficient reverse genetics system was developed that allows genetic manipulation of the rotavirus segmented double-stranded RNA genome. Using the reverse genetics system, we show that it is possible to modify one of the rotavirus genome segments (segment 7) such that virus gains the capacity to express a separate heterologous protein in addition to the full complement of viral proteins. Through this approach, we have generated wild-type-like rotaviruses that express various fluorescent reporter proteins, including UnaG (green), mRuby (far red), mKate (red), and TagBFP (blue). Such strains will be of value in probing rotavirus biology and pathogenesis by live cell imagining techniques. Notably, our work indicates that the rotavirus genome is remarkably flexible and able to accommodate significant amounts of heterologous RNA sequence, raising the possibility of using the virus as a vaccine expression vector.

"Different oral vaccines intended to control fox rabies were administered to 271 wild rodents. Vaccines were administered orally or by the mucosal route to four different European species belonging to the genera Apodemus, Arvicola, Clethrionomys and Microtus. These rodents are likely to consume baits and to have contact with the vaccine. Two genetically engineered vaccines were tested: SAG1 (an avirulent mutant of the rabies virus) and V-RG (vaccinia recombinant virus expressing the rabies glycoprotein gene). Both were found to be completely innocuous when administered orally or by the mucosal route. The residual pathogenicity of conventional modified live vaccines derived from the SAD strain was confirmed.

"Myxoma virus (MYXV) is the prototypic member of the Leporipoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family of viruses. In nature, MYXV is highly restricted to leporids and causes a lethal disease called myxomatosis only in European rabbits (Oryctologous cuniculus). However, MYXV has been shown to also productively infect various types of nonrabbit transformed and cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas their normal somatic cell counterparts undergo abortive infections. This selective tropism of MYXV for cancer cells outside the rabbit host has facilitated its development as an oncolytic virus for the treatment of different types of cancers. Like other poxviruses, MYXV possesses a large dsDNA genome which encodes an array of dozens of immunomodulatory proteins that are important for host and cellular tropism and modulation of host antiviral innate immune responses, some of which are rabbit-specific and others can function in nonrabbit cells as well. This review summarizes the functions of one such MYXV host range protein, M029, an ortholog of the larger superfamily of poxvirus encoded E3-like dsRNA binding proteins. M029 has been identified as a multifunctional protein involved in MYXV cellular and host tropism, antiviral responses, and pathogenicity in rabbits.

"Hamster fibroblast protein and rabbit hemoglobin were labelled by incubation of fibroblasts (BHK21) or reticulocytes with [3H]leucine. Alternatively, human or rabbit hemoglobin was labelled by carbamoylation of erythrocytes with K14CNO. The labelled hemoglobins were introduced into fibroblasts by virus-mediated fusion between the blood cells and fibroblasts. The hemoglobins became uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm. Degradation was assessed from release of acid-soluble radioactivity into the medium. Radioactivity from [14C]-carbamoylhemoglobin was released as carbamoylvaline and homocitrulline, and these compounds were not metabolized or reincorporated by the cells. Intermediate degradation products could not be detected. The degradation of hemoglobin followed first-order kinetics. The half-life of both carbamoylated and native rabbit hemoglobin in hamster fibroblasts was 28 h, and the half-life of carbamoylated human hemoglobin was about 150 h in fibroblasts from hamster (BHK21), mouse (Balb/3T3), and man (MRC 5), corresponding to that of the more stable endogenous proteins. Phenylhydrazine increased the intracellular degradation of carbamoylated human hemoglobin about 13 times, whereas the degradation of endogenous proteins was little affected. Hemoglobin was degraded in homogenates at 31% h-1 at pH 5 and 0.3% h-1 at pH 7.4. Phenylhydrazine increased these rates to 45% h-1 and 9.7% h-1, respectively. Growing hamster fibroblasts, which are brought into quiescence by serum deprivation or by high culture density, increase the degradation of endogenous protein and of hemoglobin in parallel.

"We investigated mechanistic differences in antigen presentation between murine MHC class I variants H-2K(b) and H-2K(bm)8. H-2K(bm)8 differs from H-2K(b) by four residues at the floor of the peptide-binding site, affecting its B pocket which interacts with the second (P2) residue of the peptide. The rest of the molecule, including the T cell receptor (TCR)-contacting residues, is identical to H-2K(b). Due to this variation, CTLs that recognize the ovalbumin 257-264 and HSV gB 498-505 peptides on H-2K(b) cannot recognize them on H-2K(bm)8. This could be due to impaired peptide binding or an altered peptide: K(bm)8 conformation. Peptide binding studies ruled out the first explanation. Molecular modeling indicated that the most obvious consequence of amino acid variation between peptide/H-2K(b) and peptide/H-2K(bm)8 complexes would be a loss of the conserved hydrogen bond network in the B pocket of the latter. This could cause conformational variation of bound peptides. Intermolecular second-site reversion was used to test this hypothesis: P2-substituted OVA and HSV peptides, engineered to restore the hydrogen bond network of the B pocket, were the only ones which restored CTL recognition. These results provide a molecular understanding of peptide/MHC conformational variation.

"The assembly of DNA into compact particles that do not aggregate in physiologic salt solution occurs naturally in chromatin and viral particles but has been challenging to duplicate using artificial constructs. Cross-linking amino-containing polycations in the presence of DNA with bisimidoester cross-linker leads to the formation of caged DNA particles that are stable in salt solutions. This first demonstration of caged DNA provides insight into how natural condensation processes avoid aggregation and a promising avenue for developing nonviral gene therapy vectors.

"Legionella pneumophila invades protozoa with an ""accidental"" ability to cause pneumonia upon transmission to humans. To support its nutrition during intracellular residence, L. pneumophila relies on host amino acids as the main source of carbon and energy to feed the TCA cycle. Despite the apparent lack of a requirement for glucose for L. pneumophila growth in vitro and intracellularly, the organism contains multiple amylases, which hydrolyze polysaccharides into glucose monomers. Here we describe one predicted putative amylase, LamB, which is uniquely present only in L. pneumophila and L. steigerwaltii among the ~60 species of Legionella. Our data show that LamB has a strong amylase activity, which is abolished upon substitutions of amino acids that are conserved in the catalytic pocket of amylases. Loss of LamB or expression of catalytically-inactive variants of LamB results in a severe growth defect of L. pneumophila in Acanthamoeba polyphaga and human monocytes-derived macrophages. Importantly, the lamB null mutant is severely attenuated in intra-pulmonary proliferation in the mouse model and is defective in dissemination to the liver and spleen. Our data show an essential role for LamB in intracellular replication of L. pneumophila in amoeba and human macrophages and in virulence in vivo.

"Laboratory experiments were performed on four different soils, using 100 cm long columns, to determine the extent of virus movement when wastewater percolated through the soils at various hydraulic flow rates. Unchlorinated secondary sewage effluent seeded with either poliovirus type 1 (strain LSc) or echovirus type 1 (isolate V239) was continuously applied to soil columns for 3 to 4 days at constant flow rates. Water samples were extracted daily from ceramic samplers at various depths of the column for the virus assay. The effectiveness of virus removal from wastewater varied greatly among the different soil types but appeared to be largely related to hydraulic flow rates. At a flow rate of 33 cm/day, Anthony sandy loam removed 99% of seeded poliovirus within the first 7 cm of the column. At flow rates of 300 cm/day and above, Rubicon sand gave the poorest removal of viruses; less than 90% of the seeded viruses were removed by passage of effluent through the entire length of the soil column. By linear regression analyses, the rate of virus removal in soil columns was found to be negatively correlated with the flow of the percolating sewage effluent. There was no significant difference in rate of removal between poliovirus and echovirus in soil columns 87 cm long. The rate of virus removal in the upper 17 cm of the soil column was found to be significantly greater than in the lower depths of the soil column. This study suggests that the flow rate of water through the soil may be the most important factor in predicting the potential of virus movement into the groundwater. Furthermore, the length of the soil column is critical in obtaining useful data to predict virus movement into groundwater.

"Aflatoxins and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in high incidence areas for this cancer, namely southeast Asia and parts of Africa. There is evidence from both epidemiological studies and animal models that the two factors can act synergistically to increase the risk of HCC. The cellular and molecular mechanism of the interaction between these two factors is as yet undefined. However, one possible mechanism attested to by studies in HBV transgenic mice is that chronic liver injury alters the expression of specific carcinogen metabolising enzymes thus modulating the binding of aflatoxin to DNA in hepatocytes. The high levels of aflatoxin exposure which occur in many areas of the world where chronic HBV infection is endemic indicate that measures to reduce aflatoxin exposure would contribute to reducing HCC incidence. In preliminary studies, Guinea-Conakry have established baseline data for the implementation of a community-based intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of improved post-harvest processing and storage of the groundnut crop, a major source of aflatoxins. Aflatoxin-albumin adducts were measured in 423 sera from individuals living in the four natural geographic zones of Guinea. More than 95% of the serum samples were positive for this biomarker and highest exposures were found in Lower Guinea where groundnuts are consumed as a dietary staple. Variations in mean levels between villages within a geographic region did not vary greatly. HBV infection was endemic in all regions with an overall prevalence of 16.7% chronic carriers. Thus in this population both HBV vaccination and reduction in aflatoxin exposure would be beneficial in decreasing morbidity and mortality from liver disease.

"Developing antiviral therapies for influenza A virus (IAV) infection is an ongoing process because of the rapid rate of antigenic mutation and the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. The ideal strategy is to develop drugs that target well-conserved, functionally restricted, and unique surface structures without affecting host cell function. We recently identified the antiviral compound, RK424, by screening a library of 50,000 compounds using cell-based infection assays. RK424 showed potent antiviral activity against many different subtypes of IAV in vitro and partially protected mice from a lethal dose of A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) virus in vivo. Here, we show that RK424 inhibits viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) activity, causing the viral nucleoprotein (NP) to accumulate in the cell nucleus. In silico docking analysis revealed that RK424 bound to a small pocket in the viral NP. This pocket was surrounded by three functionally important domains: the RNA binding groove, the NP dimer interface, and nuclear export signal (NES) 3, indicating that it may be involved in the RNA binding, oligomerization, and nuclear export functions of NP. The accuracy of this binding model was confirmed in a NP-RK424 binding assay incorporating photo-cross-linked RK424 affinity beads and in a plaque assay evaluating the structure-activity relationship of RK424. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and pull-down assays showed that RK424 inhibited both the NP-RNA and NP-NP interactions, whereas size exclusion chromatography showed that RK424 disrupted viral RNA-induced NP oligomerization. In addition, in vitro nuclear export assays confirmed that RK424 inhibited nuclear export of NP. The amino acid residues comprising the NP pocket play a crucial role in viral replication and are highly conserved in more than 7,000 NP sequences from avian, human, and swine influenza viruses. Furthermore, we found that the NP pocket has a surface structure different from that of the pocket in host molecules. Taken together, these results describe a promising new approach to developing influenza virus drugs that target a novel pocket structure within NP.

"Dog and rat animal models have been developed for repeated intravascular administrations to the liver. However, mice have generally been considered too small to use for these models. This study describes the development of mouse models that permit the establishment of liver metastases that can be subsequently treated by repeated injections into the portal venous system. A mini-laparotomy is done to mobilize the spleen and transpose it to a s.c. pocket with its vascular pedicle intact. A suspension of single tumor cells is then inoculated into the portal vein to establish diffuse liver metastases. These tumors may be treated by simple percutaneous injections directly into the s.c. whole spleen reservoir. The ease of injection into the s.c. spleen permits repeated injections into the portal venous system. The usefulness of this model was shown in experiments revealing that multiple portal venous administrations of a replication-conditional, oncolytic herpes simplex virus mutant are more effective than a single portal venous administration. In a modification of this model, the spleen is first split into two, leaving intact the vascular pedicle for each half of the spleen. Tumor cells are inoculated into one hemi-spleen, which is then resected 10 minutes later. The other hemi-spleen is transposed to the s.c. position, thereby permitting subsequent repetitive portal venous injections via percutaneous injections into the s.c. hemi-spleen. These mouse models are useful for a wide range of studies.

"We describe the extremely rapid worldwide spread of the Lagovirus europaeus/GI.2/RHDV2/b (henceforth GI.2), the causative infectious agent of the so-called 'novel' rabbit haemorrhagic disease of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). We tracked down all novel confirmed detections of GI.2 between May 2010 and November 2018 by carrying out a two-step in-depth review. We suggest that such spread would not have been possible without anthropogenic involvement. Our results also point out the importance of reviewing and adapting the protocols of virus detection and management in order to control, mitigate and contain properly, not only GI.2, but also new viruses that may emerge in the future.

"Dengue virus (DV) is an important mosquito-borne flavivirus threatening almost half of the world's population. Prophylaxis and potent anti-DV drugs are urgently needed. Here, we developed a high content imaging-based (HCI) assay with DV type 2 expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry (DV2/mCherry) to improve the efficiency and robustness of the drug discovery process. For the construction of the reporter virus, the mCherry gene followed by the ribosome-skipping 2A sequence of the Thosea asigna virus (T2A) was placed upstream of the full DV2 open reading frame. The biological characteristics including mCherry expression, virus replication rate, and plaque phenotype was examined and validated in BHK-21, Vero and C6/36 cells. A robust image-based antiviral assay combined with an automated robotic system was then developed, with a Z' factor of 0.73. To validate the image-based antiviral assay, a panel of reference compounds with different molecular mechanisms of anti-DV activity was assessed: (i) the glycosylation inhibitor, Celgosivir, (ii) two NS4b-targeting compounds: a 3-Acyl-indole derivative and NITD618, and (iii) two nucleoside viral polymerase inhibitors, 2'CMC and 7DMA. The inhibition profiles were quantified and obtained by means of HCI and RT-qPCR. Both methods resulted in very comparable inhibition profiles. In conclusion, a powerful and robust assay was developed with a fully automated data generation and processing pipeline. It makes the new reporter virus assay amenable to high-throughput screening of large libraries of small molecules.

"Targeting bacterial virulence mechanisms without compromising bacterial growth is a promising strategy to prevent drug resistance. LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) possess structural conservation across bacterial species and regulate virulence in numerous pathogens, making them attractive targets for antimicrobial agents. We targeted AphB, a Vibrio cholerae LTTR, which regulates the expression of genes encoding cholera toxin and toxin-co-regulated pilus for inhibitor designing. Since AphB ligand is unknown, we followed a molecular fragment-based approach for ligand designing using FDA-approved drugs and subsequent screen to identify molecules that exhibited high-affinity binding to AphB ligand-binding pocket. Among the identified compounds, ribavirin, an anti-viral drug, antagonized AphB functions. Ribavirin perturbed Vibrio cholerae pathogenesis in animal models. The inhibitory effects of the drug was limited to the bacteria expressing wild type AphB, but not its constitutively active mutant (AphB(N100E)), which represents the ligand-bound state, suggesting that ribavirin binds to the active site of AphB to exert its inhibitory role and there exists no AphB-independent mechanism of its action. Similarly, ribavirin suppressed the functions of Salmonella Typhi LTTR Hrg, indicating its broad spectrum efficacy. Moreover, ribavirin did not affect the bacterial viability in culture. This study cites an example of drug repurposing for anti-infective therapy.

"The retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and the pRb-related proteins, p130 and p107, form the 'pocket protein' family of cell cycle regulatory factors. A well characterized function of these proteins is the cell cycle-dependent regulation of E2F-responsive genes. The biological activity of pocket proteins is regulated by phosphorylation and for the founding member pRb it has been shown that acetylation also has an important role in modulating its function during the cell cycle. Here, we show that hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma 2 (Rb2)/p130 also exists in an acetylated form in NIH3T3 cells. Acetylated p130 is present in the nucleus but not in the cytoplasm. Acetylation is cell cycle dependent, starting in S-phase and persisting until late G(2)-period. Using recombinant p130 and truncated forms for in vitro acetylation by the acetyltransferase p300, we could identify K1079 in the C-terminal part as the major acetylation site by mass spectrometry. Minor acetylation sites were pinpointed to K1068 and K1111 in the C-terminus, and K128 and K130 in the N-terminus. The human papilloma virus 16 protein-E7 preferentially binds to acetylated p130 and significantly increases in vitro p130 acetylation by p300.

"The progesterone receptor (PR) plays a key role in reproduction and is important in cancers of the reproductive tract. Current PR antagonists usually compete for progestin binding in the PR ligand-binding pocket and often exhibit cross-binding with other members of the steroid receptor family. Using stably transfected cells expressing reporter genes, a set of ∼150 theophylline analogues were screened for their ability to inhibit progesterone, estrogen, glucocorticoid and androgen signaling. The structure-activity studies presented here identify branched 8-alkylthio-6-thio-substitutions of theophylline as selective PR inhibitors. 6-Thio-8-(2-ethylbutyl)thiotheophylline (51), the most extensively studied derivative, does not act by competing with progestins for binding in the ligand-binding pocket of PR. It demonstrated the ability to inhibit the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-luciferase reporter and endogenous PR-regulated alkaline phosphatase activity in T47D breast cancer cells. Compound 51 is the lead member of a novel class of PR inhibitors that act outside the PR ligand-binding pocket, thus serving as a novel probe to investigate PR action and a lead for further development.

"DNA vaccines can be manufactured cheaply, easily and rapidly and have performed well in pre-clinical animal studies. However, clinical trials have so far been disappointing, failing to evoke a strong immune response, possibly due to poor antigen expression. To improve antigen expression, improved technology to monitor DNA vaccine transfection efficiency is required. In the current study, we compared plasmid encoded tdTomato, mCherry, Katushka, tdKatushka2 and luciferase as reporter proteins for whole animal in vivo imaging. The intramuscular, subcutaneous and tattooing routes were compared and electroporation was used to enhance expression. We observed that overall, fluorescent proteins were not a good tool to assess expression from DNA plasmids, with a highly heterogeneous response between animals. Of the proteins used, intramuscular delivery of DNA encoding either tdTomato or luciferase gave the clearest signal, with some Katushka and tdKatushka2 signal observed. Subcutaneous delivery was weakly visible and nothing was observed following DNA tattooing. DNA encoding haemagglutinin was used to determine whether immune responses mirrored visible expression levels. A protective immune response against H1N1 influenza was induced by all routes, even after a single dose of DNA, though qualitative differences were observed, with tattooing leading to high antibody responses and subcutaneous DNA leading to high CD8 responses. We conclude that of the reporter proteins used, expression from DNA plasmids can best be assessed using tdTomato or luciferase. But, the disconnect between visible expression level and immunogenicity suggests that in vivo whole animal imaging of fluorescent proteins has limited utility for predicting DNA vaccine efficacy.

"We have reported previously that herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection disrupts normal progression of the mammalian cell cycle, causing cells to enter a G(1)-like state. Infected cells were characterized by a decline in cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) activities, loss of hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), accumulation of E2F-pocket protein complexes, and failure to initiate cellular DNA replication. In the present study, we investigated the role of the pocket proteins pRb, p107, and p130 in HSV-1-dependent cell cycle inhibition and cyclin kinase regulation by infecting murine 3T3 cells derived from wild-type (WT) mouse embryos or embryos with deletions of pRb (pRb(-/-)), p107 (p107(-/-)), p130 (p130(-/-)), or both p130 and p107 (p130(-/-)/p107(-/-)). With respect to CDK2 inhibition, viral protein accumulation, viral DNA replication, and progeny virus yield, WT, pRb(-/-), and p107(-/-) cells were essentially identical. In contrast, after infection of p130(-/-) cells, we observed no inhibition of CDK2 activity, a 5- to 6-h delay in accumulation of viral proteins, an impaired ability to form viral DNA replication compartments, and reduced viral DNA synthesis. As a result, progeny virus yield was reduced 2 logs compared to that in WT cells. Notably, p130(-/-)/p107(-/-) double-knockout cells had a virus replication phenotype intermediate between those of the p107(-/-) and p130(-/-) cells. We conclude from these studies that p130 is a key factor in regulating aspects of cell cycle progression, as well as the timely expression of viral genes and replication of viral DNA.

"Silky Fowl is a natural mutant with hyperpigmentation of various internal tissues. Although the mechanism of hyperpigmentation remains unclear, recent studies have shown that the abnormal migration of melanoblast and the absence of environmental barrier molecules are responsible for the hyperpigmentation in Silky Fowl. In this study, 13 genes related to melanocyte development were selected to detect expression changes between Silky Fowl and White Leghorn [including SRY-box 10 (Sox10), paired box (Pax3), stem cell factor (Scf), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (Kit), endothelin type-B receptor (Ednrb), endothelin 3 (Edn3), microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf), tyrosinase (Tyr), tyrosinase-related protein-1 (Trp1), tyrosinase-related protein-2 (Trp2), melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r), Agouti-related proteins (Agrp), and Proopiomelanocortin (Pomc)]. Transcript expression was detected in 11 stages from 2.5 to 15 days of incubation. In these embryonic periods, Mitf, Kit, Scf, and Agrp expressed earlier in Silky Fowl than in White Leghorn. Sox10, Ednrb, Kit, Mc1r, and Agrp, associating with the proliferation and differentiation of melanoblast, expressed higher (P < 0.05) in Silky Fowl than White Leghorn during 5-6 days of incubation. After day 8 of incubation, Mitf, Tyr, Trp1, Trp2, and Mc1r expressed higher (P < 0.05) in Silky Fowl than White Leghorn, while Agrp expressed higher (P < 0.05) in White Leghorn than Silky Fowl. Moreover, a regulatory network for melanocyte development was constructed based on the expression data. The network predicted novel regulatory relationships and confirmed relationships that have been reported. These results provide biological insight into the molecular mechanism of hyperpigmentation in the Silky Fowl. However, further investigation is needed to confirm these regulatory relationships.

"We report on the ability of single-chain variable fragment (scFv) incorporated into the viral envelope to alter the tropism of herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1716. Using recombinant viruses expressing fusion proteins comprising cell-surface antigen-specific scFvs N terminus linked to amino acids 274-393 of gD, we demonstrated that the tropism of these HSV1716 variants was modified such that infection was mediated by the cognate antigen. Thus, an HSV1716 variant that expressed an anti-CD55 scFv targeting moiety linked to these gD residues was able to infect non-permissive Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing CD55 and this infection was specifically blocked by an anti-CD55 monoclonal antibody. Similarly, the infection efficiency of an HSV1716 variant for semi-permissive human leukaemic, CD38-positive cell lines was greatly improved by an anti-CD38 scFv targeting moiety linked to gD residues 274-393, and this enhanced infectivity was abrogated specifically by an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. Finally, intravenous/intraperitoneal injection of an HSV1716 variant displaying an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) scFv linked to residues 274-393 of gD enhanced destruction of subcutaneous EGFR-positive tumours in nude mice compared to unmodified HSV1716. Therefore, targeting of HSV1716 oncolysis to specific cell types through the display of entry mediating scFv/gD fusion proteins represents an efficient route for systemic delivery.

"BACKGROUND: Antivirals are needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2. The clinically-proven protease inhibitor Camostat mesylate inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection by blocking the virus-activating host cell protease TMPRSS2. However, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate metabolites and potential viral resistance have not been analyzed. Moreover, antiviral activity of Camostat mesylate in human lung tissue remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We used recombinant TMPRSS2, reporter particles bearing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 or authentic SARS-CoV-2 to assess inhibition of TMPRSS2 and viral entry, respectively, by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA. FINDINGS: We show that several TMPRSS2-related proteases activate SARS-CoV-2 and that two, TMPRSS11D and TMPRSS13, are robustly expressed in the upper respiratory tract. However, entry mediated by these proteases was blocked by Camostat mesylate. The Camostat metabolite GBPA inhibited recombinant TMPRSS2 with reduced efficiency as compared to Camostat mesylate. In contrast, both inhibitors exhibited similar antiviral activity and this correlated with the rapid conversion of Camostat mesylate into GBPA in the presence of serum. Finally, Camostat mesylate and GBPA blocked SARS-CoV-2 spread in human lung tissue ex vivo and the related protease inhibitor Nafamostat mesylate exerted augmented antiviral activity. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can use TMPRSS2 and closely related proteases for spread in the upper respiratory tract and that spread in the human lung can be blocked by Camostat mesylate and its metabolite GBPA.

"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are traditionally regarded as nonpermissive cells for herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection as they lack the specific entry receptors, and modified CHO cells have been instrumental in the identification of HSV-1 receptors in numerous studies. In this report we demonstrate that the HSV-1 strain 17+ variant HSV1716 is able to infect unmodified CHO cells but only if the virus is propagated in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. Infection of CHO cells by BHK-propagated HSV1716 results in expression of immediate-early, early, and late viral genes, and infectious progeny virions are produced. In normally cultured CHO cells, up to a maximum of 50% of cells were permissive for BHK-propagated HSV1716 infection, with 24 h of serum starvation increasing this to 100% of CHO cells, suggesting that the mechanism used by BHK-propagated virus to infect CHO cells was cell cycle dependent. The altered tropism of HSV1716 was also evident in another nonpermissive mouse melanoma cell line and is an exclusive property resulting from propagation of the virus using BHK cells, as viruses propagated on Vero, C8161 (a human melanoma cell line), or indeed, CHO cells were completely unable to infect either CHO or mouse melanoma cells.

"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has recently emerged as an important neurotropic virus in Asia because effective medications and prophylactic vaccine against EV71 infection are not available. Based on the success of inactivated poliovirus vaccine, the Vero cell-based chemically inactivated EV71 vaccine candidate could be developed. Identification of EV71 vaccine strain which can grow to high titer in Vero cell and induce cross-genotype virus neutralizing antibody responses represents the first step in vaccine development. In this report we describe the characterization and validation of a clinical isolate E59 belonging to B4 sub-genotype based on VP1 genetic analysis. Before selected as the vaccine strain, the genetic stability of E59 in passage had been analyzed based on the nucleotide sequences obtained from the Master Virus Seed, Working Seed banks and the virus harvested from the production lots, and found to be identical to those found in the original isolate. These results indicate that E59 vaccine strain has strong genetic stability in passage. Using this vaccine strain the prototype EV71 vaccine candidate was produced from 20L of Vero cell grown in serum-containing medium. The production processes were investigated, characterized and quantified to establish the potential vaccine manufacturing process including the time for virus harvest, the membrane for diafiltration and concentration, the gel-filtration chromatography for the down-stream virus purification, and the methods for viral inactivation. Finally, the inactivated virion vaccine candidate containing sub-microgram of viral proteins formulated with alum adjuvant was found to induce strong virus neutralizing antibody responses in mice and rabbits. Therefore, these results provide valuable information for cell-based EV71 vaccine development.

"OBJECTIVE: Reduction of melanocortin signaling in the brain results in obesity. However, where in the brain reduced melanocortin signaling mediates this effect is poorly understood. DESIGN: We determined the effects of long-term inhibition of melanocortin receptor activity in specific brain regions of the rat brain. Melanocortin signaling was inhibited by injection of a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector that overexpressed Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH), the lateral hypothalamus (LH) or the accumbens shell (Acc). RESULTS: Overexpression of AgRP in the rat PVN, VMH or LH increased bodyweight, the percentage of white adipose tissue, plasma leptin and insulin concentrations and food intake. Food intake was mainly increased because of an increase in meal size in the light and dark phases, after overexpression of AgRP in the PVN, LH or VMH. Overexpression of AgRP in the PVN or VMH reduced average body core temperature in the dark on day 40 post injection, whereas AgRP overexpression in the LH did not affect temperature. In addition, overexpression of AgRP in the PVN, LH or VMH did not significantly alter mRNA expression of AgRP, neuropeptide Y (NPY), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) or suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) in the arcuate. Overexpression of AgRP in the Acc did not have any effect on the measured parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of melanocortin signaling in several hypothalamic regions increased meal size. However, there were brain area-specific effects on other parameters such as core temperature and plasma leptin concentrations. In a previous study, where NPY was overexpressed with an rAAV vector in the PVN and LH, meal frequency and meal size were increased respectively, whereas locomotor activity was reduced by NPY overexpression at both nuclei. Taken together, AgRP and NPY have complementary roles in energy balance.

"Myxomatosis is an infectious disease caused by myxoma virus (MYXV; genus Leporipoxvirus), which affects the European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and sporadically brown hares (Lepus europaeus). Here, we describe the first outbreak of myxomatosis in Iberian hares (Lepus granatensis). Between mid-July and the end of September 2018, around 530 dead animals were detected in Iberian hare populations in southern Spain. The apparent mean mortality rate was 56.7%, and the estimated mean case fatality rate was 69.2%. Histopathological and molecular results confirmed MYXV infections in all hares analysed. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first myxomatosis outbreak causing a high mortality in hares and the first detailed characterization of a myxomatosis outbreak in the Iberian hare. The absence of cases in sympatric wild rabbits suggests differences in the susceptibility between both lagomorph species to the virus strain implicated in the outbreak. After the first case, the number of affected areas increased sharply affecting most of the Iberian Peninsula where the Iberian hare is present. Further studies are required to elucidate the origin of the implicated MYXV strain as well as to assess the impact of this outbreak on the Iberian hare populations.

"The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is emerging as a major site of action for the appetite-suppressive effects of leading pharmacotherapies currently investigated to treat obesity. However, our understanding of how NTS neurons regulate appetite remains incomplete. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we used NTS nutrient sensing as an entry point to characterize stimulus-defined neuronal ensembles engaged by the NTS to produce physiological satiety. METHODS: We combined histological analysis, neuroanatomical assessment using inducible viral tracing tools, and functional tests to characterize hindbrain-forebrain circuits engaged by NTS leucine sensing to suppress hunger. RESULTS: We found that NTS detection of leucine engages NTS prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) neurons to inhibit AgRP neurons via a population of leptin receptor-expressing neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. This circuit is necessary for the anorectic response to NTS leucine, the appetite-suppressive effect of high-protein diets, and the long-term control of energy balance. CONCLUSIONS: These results extend the integrative capability of AgRP neurons to include brainstem nutrient sensing inputs.

"The patient who presents with an acute painful synovitis of a single joint provides a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the primary care physician. An aggressive approach is required to differentiate a potential infectious arthritis, with its attendant morbidity and potential mortality, from other causes of monarthritis that are not immediately life-threatening. This article reviews the common causes of acute monarthritis in the adult, including the presentation, as well as guidelines for rapid and efficient diagnosis and management. Common causes include infections (bacterial/Lyme/mycobacterial/viral), microcrystalline disease (gout/pseudogout), and traumatic and reactive arthropathy. In addition, guidelines are suggested for the management approach to acute monarthritis when initial diagnostic testing is unrevealing of a specific diagnosis.

"The response of wild and domestic rabbits with a degree of genetic resistance to myxomatosis has been shown to be markedly affected by the age at which they were infected with a virulent strain of the virus. The response, in terms of mean survival time and percentage survival, fell with increasing age from 10 to 30 weeks with little change thereafter.

"The interaction of Nipah virus (NiV) nucleocapsid (N) protein with phosphoprotein (P) during nucleocapsid assembly is the essential process in the viral life cycle, since only the encapsidated RNA genome can be used for replication. To identify the region responsible for N-P interaction, we utilized fluorescent protein tags to visualize NiV N and P proteins in live cells and analyzed their cellular localization. N protein fused to monomeric enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (N-ECFP) exhibited a dotted pattern in transfected cells, while P protein fused to monomeric red fluorescent protein (P-mRFP) showed diffuse distribution. When the two proteins were coexpressed, P-mRFP colocalized with N-ECFP dots. N-ECFP mutants with serial amino acid deletions were generated to search for the region(s) responsible for this N-P colocalization. We found that, in addition to the 467- to 496-amino-acid (aa) region reported previously, aa 135 to 146 were responsible for the N-P colocalization. The residues crucial for N-P interaction were further investigated by introducing alanine substitutions into the untagged N protein. Alanine scanning in the region of aa 135 to 146 has revealed that there are distinct regions essential for the interaction of N-P and the function of N. This is the first study to visualize Nipah viral proteins in live cells and to assess the essential domain of N protein for the interaction with P protein.

"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a γ-herpesvirus which infects over 90% of the adult human population. Most notably, this virus causes infectious mononucleosis but it is also associated with cancers such as Hodgkin and Burkitt lymphoma. EBV is a species-specific virus and has been studied in many animal models, including nonhuman primates, guinea pigs, humanized mice, and tree shrews. However, none of these animal models are considered the ""gold standard"" for EBV research. Recently, rabbits have emerged as a viable alternative model, as they are susceptible to EBV infection. In addition, the EBV infection progresses after immune suppression with cyclosporine A (CsA), modeling the reactivation of EBV after latency. We sought to refine this model for acute or active EBV infections by performing antibody-mediated depletion of certain immune subsets in rabbits. Fourteen 16 to 20-wk old, NZW rabbits were intravenously inoculated with EBV and concurrently treated with either anti-CD4 T-cell antibody, anti-pan-T-cell antibody (anti CD45), CSA, or, as a control, anti-HPV antibody. Rabbits that received the depleting antibodies were treated with CsA 3 times at a dose of 15 mg/kg SC once per day for 4 d starting at the time of EBV inoculation then the dose was increased to 20 mg/kg SC twice weekly for 2 wk. Weights, temperatures, and clinical signs were monitored, and rabbits were anesthetized once weekly for blood collection. When compared with the control group, anti-CD4-treated rabbits had fewer clinical signs and displayed higher levels of viral DNA via qPCR in splenocytes; however, flow cytometry results showed only a partial depletion of CD4 T-cells. Treatment with anti-pan-T-cell antibody did not result in noticeable T-cell depletion. These data suggest the EBV-infected rabbit is a promising model for testing antiviral medications and prophylactic vaccines for EBV.

"The European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has become the major agricultural and environmental pest species in Australia. Current methods of rabbit control are lethal procedures which are increasingly questioned for their overall efficiency, applicability, specificity, cost and humaneness. New initiatives are required. One such initiative is virus-vectored immunocontraception. In this approach, the lagomorph-specific myxoma virus will be genetically engineered to include genes encoding components of rabbit gametes which can induce an immune response that causes infertility. Central to such a strategy is the ability to identify antigens capable of inducing an immunocontraceptive response. A strategy for identifying such antigens has been described previously. A case study of one sperm antigen, PH-20, is reported here. The issues involved in developing this antigen to the stage where it could be considered as a candidate for insertion into a recombinant myxoma virus with the ultimate goal of testing for immunocontraceptive efficacy are discussed. Techniques for inserting genes into myxoma virus have been described previously. The knowledge gained from research with this particular antigen are broadly applicable to other antigens used for both immunocontraceptive vaccines in general and, specifically, for virus-vectored immunocontraception.

"Human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV4) is an etiological agent of acute respiratory disease (ARD) in pediatric and adult patients. HAdV4 strains can be divided into two major genomic clusters, namely prototype (p)-like viruses and a-like viruses. Here, the complete genome sequence of HAdV4 strain GZ01, isolated from a child with ARD in southern China, is first reported and analyzed. This strain was determined to be of the 4a1 genome-type based on in silico restriction profiles. Then, a replication-competent rAd4DsRed virus, containing the HAdV4 GZ01 infectious genome and expressing the reporter molecule DsRed, was generated and characterized. Recombinant rAd4DsRed can infect AD293, hamster, and mouse cells in which DsRed protein was expressed. No changes in antigenicity and genome replication were detected for rAd4DsRed and wild-type HAdV4. Mice immunized with rAd4DsRed was elicited a marked antibody response to DsRed. A rapid method of testing neutralizing antibodies against HAdV3 and HAdV4 was also established using a mixture of rAd4DsRed and rAd3EGFP. Our results provide the foundation to develop HAdV4 vaccines, potential vector platforms for vaccine and gene therapy, and rapid methods for serological and antiviral screening.

"A 29 nucleotide deletion in open reading frame 8 (ORF8) is the most obvious genetic change in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) during its emergence in humans. In spite of intense study, it remains unclear whether the deletion actually reflects adaptation to humans. Here we engineered full, partially deleted (-29 nt), and fully deleted ORF8 into a SARS-CoV infectious cDNA clone, strain Frankfurt-1. Replication of the resulting viruses was compared in primate cell cultures as well as Rhinolophus bat cells made permissive for SARS-CoV replication by lentiviral transduction of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Cells from cotton rat, goat, and sheep provided control scenarios that represent host systems in which SARS-CoV is neither endemic nor epidemic. Independent of the cell system, the truncation of ORF8 (29 nt deletion) decreased replication up to 23-fold. The effect was independent of the type I interferon response. The 29 nt deletion in SARS-CoV is a deleterious mutation acquired along the initial human-to-human transmission chain. The resulting loss of fitness may be due to a founder effect, which has rarely been documented in processes of viral emergence. These results have important implications for the retrospective assessment of the threat posed by SARS.

"Polyomavirus large T antigen transactivates a variety of genes whose products are involved in S phase induction. These genes are regulated by the E2F family of transcription factors, which are under the control of the pocket protein retinoblastoma protein and its relatives p130 and p107. The viral protein causes a dissociation of E2F-pocket protein complexes that results in transactivation of the genes. This reaction requires the N-terminal binding site for pocket proteins and the J domain that binds chaperones. We found earlier that a mutation of the zinc finger located within the C-terminal domain, a region assumed to function mainly in the replication of viral DNA, also interferes with transactivation. Here we show that binding of the histone acetyltransferase coactivator complex CBP/p300-PCAF to the C terminus correlates with the ability of large T antigen to transactivate genes. This interaction results in promoter-specific acetylation of histones. Inactive mutant proteins with changes within the C-terminal domain were nevertheless able to dissociate the E2F pocket protein complexes, indicating that this dissociation is a necessary but insufficient step in the T antigen-induced transactivation of genes. It has to be accompanied by a second step involving the T antigen-mediated recruitment of a histone acetyltransferase complex.

"Recognition of phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids exposed on the extracellular leaflet of plasma membranes is implicated in both apoptotic cell removal and immune regulation. The PS receptor T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain-containing molecule 4 (Tim4) regulates T-cell immunity via phagocytosis of both apoptotic (high PS exposure) and nonapoptotic (intermediate PS exposure) activated T cells. The latter population must be removed at lower efficiency to sensitively control immune tolerance and memory cell population size, but the molecular basis for how Tim4 achieves this sensitivity is unknown. Using a combination of interfacial X-ray scattering, molecular dynamics simulations, and membrane binding assays, we demonstrate how Tim4 recognizes PS in the context of a lipid bilayer. Our data reveal that in addition to the known Ca(2+)-coordinated, single-PS binding pocket, Tim4 has four weaker sites of potential ionic interactions with PS lipids. This organization makes Tim4 sensitive to PS surface concentration in a manner capable of supporting differential recognition on the basis of PS exposure level. The structurally homologous, but functionally distinct, Tim1 and Tim3 are significantly less sensitive to PS surface density, likely reflecting the differences in immunological function between the Tim proteins. These results establish the potential for lipid membrane parameters, such as PS surface density, to play a critical role in facilitating selective recognition of PS-exposing cells. Furthermore, our multidisciplinary approach overcomes the difficulties associated with characterizing dynamic protein/membrane systems to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying Tim4's recognition properties, and thereby provides an approach capable of providing atomic-level detail to uncover the nuances of protein/membrane interactions.

"Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are unique glia that support axon outgrowth in the olfactory system, and when used as cellular therapy after spinal cord injury, improve recovery and axon regeneration. Here we assessed the effects of combining OEC transplantation with another promising therapy, epidural electrical stimulation during a rehabilitative motor task. Sprague-Dawley rats received a mid-thoracic transection and transplantation of OECs or fibroblasts (FBs) followed by lumbar stimulation while climbing an inclined grid. We injected pseudorabies virus (PRV) into hindlimb muscles 7 months post-injury to assess connectivity across the transection. Analyses showed that the number of serotonergic (5-HT) axons that crossed the rostral scar border and the area of neurofilament-positive axons in the injury site were both greater in OEC- than FB-treated rats. We detected PRV-labeled cells rostral to the transection and remarkable evidence of 5-HT and PRV axons crossing the injury site in 1 OEC- and 1 FB-treated rat. The axons that crossed suggested either axon regeneration (OEC) or small areas of probable tissue sparing (FB). Most PRV-labeled thoracic neurons were detected in laminae VII or X, and ~25% expressed Chx10, a marker for V2a interneurons. These findings suggest potential regeneration or sparing of circuits that connect thoracic interneurons to lumbar somatic motor neurons. Despite evidence of axonal connectivity, no behavioral changes were detected in this small-scale study. Together these data suggest that when supplemented with epidural stimulation and climbing, OEC transplantation can increase axonal growth across the injury site and may promote recovery of propriospinal circuitry.

"AIM: To analyze epidemiologic characteristics of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Croatia, including military implications of the disease and measures for its prevention. METHOD: We analyzed data from obligatory infectious disease reports and notification of deaths due to infectious diseases, data on the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome epidemics in Croatia, and data collected by survey of the population, serological findings, and studies of wild rodents serving as reservoirs of the infection. RESULTS: During the 1987-2001 period, 235 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome were recorded in Croatia, with 147 (62.6%) of them among Croatian Army soldiers. Mortality rate was up to 15.4% (mean 2.2%) (5/235). The highest number of cases was recorded in months of June and July, ie, during the warm season characterized by increased activity of both the animals acting as infection reservoirs and humans as hosts. The known natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome have been Plitvice and Slunj areas, Velika and Mala Kapela mountains, Zagreb area (Velika Gorica and Jastrebarsko), west Slavonia, Novska area, and Dinara Mountain. The disease has not been recorded in the littoral area and Adriatic islands. The identified causative agents include Dobrava and Puumala viruses of the genus Hantavirus, whereas rodents Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus agrarius, and Apodemus sylvaticus serve as the main reservoirs of the infection. Typical biotopes of the infection in Croatia are deciduous woods. The measures of prevention in Croatia include pest control, disinfection, hygienic waste disposal, preventing rodent access to food and water, proper choice of camping sites, and health education. CONCLUSION: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome occurs predominantly in soldiers, in a sporadic or epidemic form. Because of the course of disease and potentially lethal outcome, the disease has a considerable impact on the field task performance and combat readiness of military units, and is of great importance for a military community. Accommodation in permanent buildings with appropriate common and personal hygiene standards is recommended.

"The Eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) has been extensively used in research of chronic hepatitis B and liver cancer because its infection with the woodchuck hepatitis virus closely resembles a human hepatitis B virus infection. Development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches requires genetic information on immune pathway genes in this animal model. The woodchuck genome was assembled with a combination of high-coverage whole-genome shotgun sequencing of Illumina paired-end, mate-pair libraries and fosmid pool sequencing. The result is a 2.63 Gigabase (Gb) assembly with a contig N50 of 74.5 kilobases (kb), scaffold N50 of 892 kb, and genome completeness of 99.2%. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from seven different tissues aided in the annotation of 30,873 protein-coding genes, which in turn encode 41,826 unique protein products. More than 90% of the genes have been functionally annotated, with 82% of them containing open reading frames. This genome sequence and its annotation will enable further research in chronic hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma and contribute to the understanding of immunological responses in the woodchuck.

"The central melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) plays a critical role in energy homeostasis, although little is known regarding its role in the regulation of adaptive thermogenesis of brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we show using retrograde transsynaptic tracing with attenuated pseudorabies virus coupled with dual-label immunohistochemistry that specific subsets of MC4R-expressing neurons in multiple nuclei of the central nervous system known to regulate sympathetic outflow polysynaptically connect with interscapular BAT (IBAT). Furthermore, we show that MC4R-/- and agouti-related peptide-treated mice are defective in HF diet-induced up-regulation of uncoupling protein 1 in IBAT. Additionally, MC4R-/- mice exposed to 4 C for 4 h exhibit a defect in up-regulation of uncoupling protein 1 levels in IBAT. Our results provide a neuroanatomic substrate for MC4R regulating sympathetically mediated IBAT thermogenesis and demonstrate that the MC4R is critically required for acute high-fat- and cold-induced IBAT thermogenesis.

"Most paramyxoviruses enter the cell by direct fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane. Our previous studies have shown the colocalization of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) with the early endosome marker EEA1 and the inhibition of NDV fusion by the caveolin-phosphorylating drug phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) prompted us to propose that NDV enters the cells via endocytosis. Here we show that the virus-cell fusion and cell-cell fusion promoted by NDV-F are increased by about 30% after brief exposure to low pH in HeLa and ELL-0 cells but not in NDV receptor- deficient cell lines such as GM95 or Lec1. After a brief low-pH exposure, the percentage of NDV fusion at 29 °C was similar to that at 37 °C without acid-pH stimulation, meaning that acid pH would decrease the energetic barrier to enhance fusion. Furthermore, preincubation of cells with the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide led to the inhibition of about 30% of NDV infectivity, suggesting that a population of virus enters cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, the involvement of the GTPase dynamin in NDV entry is shown as its specific inhibitor, dynasore, also impaired NDV fusion and infectivity. Optimal infection of the host cells was significantly affected by drugs that inhibit endosomal acidification such as concanamycin A, monensin and chloroquine. These results support our hypothesis that entry of NDV into ELL-0 and HeLa cells occurs through the plasma membrane as well as by dynamin- low pH- and receptor- dependent endocytosis.

"Recent insights into the early events in Sindbis virus RNA replication suggest a requirement for either the P123 or P23 polyprotein, as well as mature nsP4, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, for initiation of minus-strand RNA synthesis. Based on this observation, we have succeeded in reconstituting an in vitro system for template-dependent initiation of SIN RNA replication. Extracts were isolated from cells infected with vaccinia virus recombinants expressing various SIN proteins and assayed by the addition of exogenous template RNAs. Extracts from cells expressing P123C>S, a protease-defective P123 polyprotein, and nsP4 synthesized a genome-length minus-sense RNA product. Replicase activity was dependent upon addition of exogenous RNA and was specific for alphavirus plus-strand RNA templates. RNA synthesis was also obtained by coexpression of nsP1, P23C>S, and nsP4. However, extracts from cells expressing nsP4 and P123, a cleavage-competent P123 polyprotein, had much less replicase activity. In addition, a P123 polyprotein containing a mutation in the nsP2 protease which increased the efficiency of processing exhibited very little, if any, replicase activity. These results provide further evidence that processing of the polyprotein inactivates the minus-strand initiation complex. Finally, RNA synthesis was detected when soluble nsP4 was added to a membrane fraction containing P123C>S, thus providing a functional assay for purification of the nsP4 RNA polymerase.

"ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15), the first ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) identified, has emerged as an important cellular antiviral factor. It consists of two UBL domains with a short linker between them. The covalent attachment of ISG15 to host and viral proteins to modify their functions, similar to ubiquitylation, is named ISGylation. Influenza B virus NS1B protein antagonizes human but not mouse ISGylation because NS1B exhibits species specificity; it only binds human and non-human primate ISG15. Previous studies have demonstrated that the N-terminal UBL domain and linker of ISG15 are required for the binding by NS1B and that the linker plays a large role in the species specificity, but the structural basis for them has not been elucidated. Here we report the crystal structure of human ISG15 in complex with NS1B at a resolution of 2.0 Å. A loop in the ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain inserts into a pocket in the NS1B dimer, forming a high affinity binding site. The nonspecific van der Waals contacts around the ISG15 linker form a low affinity site for NS1B binding. However, sequence alignment reveals that residues in the high affinity site are highly conserved in primate and non-primate ISG15. We propose that the low affinity binding around the ISG15 linker is important for the initial contact with NS1B and that the stable complex formation is largely contributed by the following high affinity interactions between ISG15 N-terminal UBL domain and NS1B. This provides a structural basis for the species-specific binding of ISG15 by the NS1B protein.

"Studies on human papillomavirus type 16 have demonstrated that the product of the early gene, E7, plays a key role in the immortalization and malignant transformation of the host cell. Several of the biological activities of HPV16 E7 are mediated by inactivation of the members of the pocket protein family, pRb, p107 and p130. In this study, we have characterized the in vitro properties of five E7 proteins from benign and malignant HPV types (10, 32, 48, 54, 77). We show that these E7 proteins associate with pRb and p107 with different efficiencies. All E7s increased the proliferative rate of immortalized rodent fibroblasts cultured in 10% calf serum containing medium. This property is completely independent of their ability to associate with the pocket proteins. Furthermore, all E7s, except HPV10 E7, stimulate G1/S progression and activated the cyclin E and cyclin A promoter in the absence of growth factors. This activity also does not correlate with the E7-efficiency of binding the pocket proteins. Together these data provide evidence that different E7s alter the regulation of the cell cycle by diverse mechanism(s). Finally, this comparative analysis of the different E7 proteins demonstrates that the oncogenicity of a HPV type is not determined by the ability of E7 to associate with the pocket proteins.

"Using vaccinia virus to express Sindbis virus (SIN) nonstructural proteins (nsPs) and template RNAs, we showed previously that synthesis of all three viral RNAs occurred only during expression of either the entire nonstructural coding region or the polyprotein precursors P123 and P34. In this report, the vaccinia virus system was used to express cleavage-defective polyproteins and nsP4 proteins containing various N-terminal extensions to directly examine the roles of the P123 and P34 polyproteins in RNA replication. Replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription occurred during coexpression of P34 and P123 polyproteins in which cleavage was blocked at either or both of the 1/2 and 2/3 sites. For all cleavage-defective P123 polyproteins, however, the ratio of subgenomic to genomic RNA was decreased, suggesting that both the 1/2 and 2/3 cleavages are required for efficient subgenomic RNA transcription. These studies indicate that the uncleaved P123 polyprotein can function as a component of the viral replicase capable of synthesizing both plus- and minus-strand RNAs. In contrast, cleavage-defective P34 was unable to function in RNA replication, even in complementation experiments in which minus-strand RNAs were provided by nsP4. A P34 polyprotein whose cleavage site was not altered could only function in RNA replication in the presence of an active nsP2 protease. Although nsP4, the putative RNA polymerase, was capable of synthesizing only minus-strand RNAs during coexpression with P123, the addition of only 22 upstream residues to nsP4 allowed both replication and transcription of subgenomic RNA to occur. These data show that the conserved domains of both nsP3 and the nsP4 polymerase do not need to be present in a P34 polyprotein to form a functional plus-strand replicase-transcriptase and suggest that the presence of an active nsP2 protease and a cleavable 3/4 site correlates with synthesis of all virus-specific RNA species.

"Long-term decline and depression of density in cyclic small rodents is a recent widespread phenomenon. These observed changes at the population level might have cascading effects at the ecosystem level. Here, we assessed relationships between changing boreal landscapes and biodiversity changes of small mammal communities. We also inferred potential effects of observed community changes for increased transmission risk of Puumala virus (PUUV) spread, causing the zoonotic disease nephropatica epidemica in humans. Analyses were based on long-term (1971-2013) monitoring data of shrews and voles representing 58 time series in northern Sweden. We calculated richness, diversity, and evenness at alpha, beta, and gamma level, partitioned beta diversity into turnover (species replacement) and nestedness (species addition/removal), used similarity percentages (SIMPER) analysis to assess community structure, and calculated the cumulated number of PUUV-infected bank voles and average PUUV prevalence (percentage of infected bank voles) per vole cycle. Alpha, beta, and gamma richness and diversity of voles, but not shrews, showed long-term trends that varied spatially. The observed patterns were associated with an increase in community contribution of bank vole (Myodes glareolus), a decrease of gray-sided vole (M. rufocanus) and field vole (Microtus agrestis) and a hump-shaped variation in contribution of common shrew (Sorex araneus). Long-term biodiversity changes were largely related to changes in forest landscape structure. Number of PUUV-infected bank voles in spring was negatively related to beta and gamma diversity, and positively related to turnover of shrews (replaced by voles) and to community contribution of bank voles. The latter was also positively related to average PUUV prevalence in spring. We showed that long-term changes in the boreal landscape contributed to explain the decrease in biodiversity and the change in structure of small mammal communities. In addition, our results suggest decrease in small mammal diversity to have knock-on effects on dynamics of infectious diseases among small mammals with potential implications for disease transmission to humans.

"A vaccinia virus transient expression system was used to determine which of the Sindbis virus (SIN) proteins and/or polyproteins are necessary for the formation of active replication complexes and, in particular, to analyze the role of nsP4, the putative polymerase, versus P34 in RNA replication. We generated vaccinia virus recombinants in which the cDNA for the entire SIN nonstructural coding region as well as cDNA copies of the individual nonstructural proteins (nsPs) and several intermediate polyproteins were placed downstream of the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase and the encephalomyocarditis virus 5' untranslated region. The proteins expressed by the vaccinia virus recombinants comigrate with authentic proteins synthesized in SIN-infected cells, and the polyproteins appear to be processed to the individual proteins of the correct size. To examine the replication efficiencies of different protein combinations, a vaccinia virus recombinant was designed to express an engineered substrate RNA which could serve as a template for replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription by the SIN nsPs. Expression of the entire SIN nonstructural coding region resulted in the synthesis of high levels of both genomic and subgenomic RNAs derived from the engineered template. No RNA replication could be detected during coexpression of the four individual nsPs, although the proteins were indistinguishable, in terms of electrophoretic mobility, from those synthesized in SIN-infected cells. Coexpression of polyproteins P12, P23, and/or P34 with the individual nsPs also did not result in detectable levels of RNA replication. However, when P123 and P34 were coexpressed, efficient RNA replication and subgenomic mRNA transcription of the substrate RNA was observed. Coexpression of nsP4 with P123 resulted in the synthesis of only minus-strand RNAs. These studies show that expression of both P123 and P34 is necessary for establishment of functional RNA replication and transcription complexes and raise the possibility that the polyproteins themselves may be functional components of these complexes. In addition, these data indicate that an nsP4 moiety expressed independently with an additional N-terminal methionine is capable of functioning in minus-strand but not plus-strand RNA synthesis.

"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has exacerbated staffing challenges already facing critical care nurses in intensive care units. Many intensive care units have been understaffed and the majority of nurses working in these units have little experience. OBJECTIVE: To describe how the skilled tele-intensive care unit nurses in our health system quickly changed from a patient-focused strategy to a clinician-focused approach during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis. METHODS: We modified workflows, deployed home workstations, and changed staffing models with the goal of providing additional clinical support to bedside colleagues while reducing exposure time and conserving personal protective equipment for those caring for this highly contagious patient population. The unit changed focus and granted more than 300 clinicians access to technology that enabled them to care for patients remotely, added nearly 200 mobile carts, and allowed more than 20 tele-intensive care unit nurses to work from home. RESULTS: Tele-intensive care unit nursing provided clinical knowledge to the nurses covering current and expanded critical care units. Using technology, virtual rounding, and increased collaboration with nurses, tele-intensive care unit nursing minimized the risk to bedside nurses while maintaining a high level of care for patients. CONCLUSION: Tele-intensive care unit nurses provided a proactive, holistic approach to caring for critically ill patients via camera as part of their routine workflow. In addition, during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, these nurses created a new strategy in virtual health care to be implemented during a crisis.

"Classic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins associate with antigen- and self-derived peptides in an allele-specific manner. Herein we present the crystal structure of the MHC class I protein H-2K(d) (K(d)) expressed by BALB/c mice in complex with an antigenic peptide derived from influenza A/PR/8/34 nucleoprotein (Flu, residues 147-155, TYQRTRALV). Analysis of our structure in conjunction with the sequences of naturally processed epitopes provides a comprehensive understanding of the dominant K(d) peptide-binding motif. We find that Flu residues Tyr(P2), Thr(P5), and Val(P9) are sequestered into the B, C, and F pockets of the K(d) groove, respectively. The shape and chemistry of the polymorphic B pocket make it an optimal binding site for the side chain of Tyr(P2) as the dominant anchoring residue of nonameric peptides. The non-polar F pocket limits the amino acid repertoire at P9 to hydrophobic residues such as Ile, Leu, or Val, whereas the C pocket restricts the size of the P5-anchoring side chain. We also show that Flu is accommodated in the complex through an unfavorable kink in the otherwise extended peptide backbone due to the presence of a prominent ridge in the K(d) groove. Surprisingly, this backbone conformation is strikingly similar to D(b)-presented peptides despite the fact that these proteins employ distinct motif-anchoring strategies. The results presented in this study provide a solid foundation for the understanding of K(d)-restricted antigen presentation and recognition events.

"Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) induces an early T cell-independent neutralizing lgM response that is followed by a long-lived, T cell-dependent lgG response. We used the specific amplification factor of several 100x of VSV-virions for immunohistology to analyze the localization of VSV-specific B cells at different time points after immunization. At the peak of the IgM response (day 4), VSV-specific B cells were predominantly present in the red pulp and marginal zone but not in the T area. These B cells were mostly stained in the cytoplasm, characterizing them as antibody secreting cells. By day 6 after immunization, germinal centers (GC) containing surface-stained VSV-specific B cells became detectable and were fully established by day 12. At the same time, large VSV-specific B cell aggregates were present in the red pulp. High numbers of VSV-specific GC associated with persisting antigen were present 1 mo after immunization and later, i.e., considerably longer than has been observed for haptens. Some GC, exhibiting follicular dendritic cells and containing VSV-specific, proliferating B cells were still detectable up to 100 d after immunization. Long-lived GC were also observed after immunization with recombinant VSV-glycoprotein in absence of adjuvants. Thus some anti-virally protective (memory) B cells are cycling and locally proliferate in long-lived GC in association with persisting antigen and therefore seem responsible for long-term maintenance of elevated antibody levels. These observations extend earlier studies with carrier hapten antigens in adjuvant depots or complexed with specific IgG; they are the first to show colocalization of antigen and specific memory B cells and to analyze a protective neutralizing antibody response against an acute viral infection.

"Flavivirus proteins are produced by co- and posttranslational proteolytic processing of a large polyprotein by both host- and virus-encoded proteinases. The viral serine proteinase, which consists of NS2B and NS3, is responsible for cleavage of at least four dibasic sites (2A/2B, 2B/3, 3/4A, and 4B/5) in the nonstructural region. Since the amino acid sequence preceding NS4B shares characteristics with signal peptides used for translocation of nascent polypeptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, it has been proposed that cleavage at the 4A/4B site is mediated by a cellular signal peptidase. In this report, cell-free translation and in vivo transient expression assays were used to study processing in the NS4 region of the yellow fever virus polyprotein. With a construct which contained NS4B preceded by 17 residues constituting the putative signal peptide (sig4B), membrane-dependent cleavage at the 4A/4B site was demonstrated in vitro. Surprisingly, processing of NS4A-4B was not observed in cell-free translation studies, and in vivo expression of several yellow fever virus polyproteins revealed that the 4A/4B cleavage occurred only during coexpression of NS2B and the proteinase domain of NS3. Examination of mutant derivatives of the NS3 proteinase domain demonstrated that cleavage at the 4A/4B site correlated with expression of an active NS2B-3 proteinase. From these results, we propose a model in which the signalase cleavage generating the N terminus of NS4B requires a prior NS2B-3 proteinase-mediated cleavage at a novel site (called the 4A/2K site) which is conserved among flaviviruses and located 23 residues upstream of the signalase site. In support of this model, mutations at the 4A/4B signalase site did not eliminate processing in the NS4 region. In contrast, substitutions at the 4A/2K site, which were engineered to block NS2B-3 proteinase-mediated cleavage, eliminated signalase cleavage at the 4A/4B site. In addition, the size of the 3(502)-4A product generated by trans processing of a truncated polyprotein, 3(502)-5(356), was consistent with cleavage at the 4A/2K site rather than at the downstream 4A/4B signalase site.

"Woodchuck (Marmota monax) is a very useful animal for studying human diseases such as endocrine, metabolic or cardiovascular diseases. It is regarded especially as the most excellent animal model for human hepatic cell cancer since woodchuck hepatitis virus has various biological characters similar to those of human hepatitis B virus. We have investigated in domestic this wild animals as laboratory experimental animals and succeeded in breeding and rearing in our outdoor facilities.

"The envelope glycoprotein (Env) of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) is proteolytically processed and transported to the cell surface where it can be incorporated into budding virions. Cell surface Env is frequently detected using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We found that the detection of Env in this manner requires the expression of the MoMuLV receptor (ATRC-1) on the cell surface, and the level of envelope protein detected correlates with the level of receptors expressed on the cell. In addition, Env detection corresponds to the Env protein's ability to bind to its receptor and can be competed out by the addition of a truncated form of the Env protein. These data suggest that Env detected on the cell surface by the FACS assay is protein that has rebound to its receptor after being secreted or shed, rather than actual surface-expressed protein. In contrast, a combined immunoprecipitation and biotinylation assay detected equal amounts of Env on the surface of both receptor-lacking and receptor-expressing cell lines. The immunoprecipitation-biotinylation assay is therefore a more appropriate method for detecting surface expression of the MoMuLV envelope protein.

"We tested the longevity of gene expression provided by autonomously replicating vectors. The vectors contain segments of human genomic DNA that provide efficient replication initiation and sequences derived from Epstein-Barr virus that provide nuclear retention. In order to monitor gene expression, the vectors also carry an expression cassette containing the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene. Replicating and control vectors were transfected into rapidly dividing human 293 cells, and gene expression and DNA retention were monitored. Gene expression decreased rapidly from a control vector lacking replication and retention functions, reaching near background levels by 10 days. Vectors having both replication and retention showed greatly prolonged gene expression, with vector DNA still detectable after 2 months. Autonomously replicating vectors also prolonged gene expression in rodent cells, in human lung epithelial cells, and in slowly dividing cell cultures. These results demonstrate the utility of this autonomous replication system for long-term retention and expression of introduced genes in mammalian cells. Such vectors could be useful for gene therapy, in combination with any of several methods for introduction of DNA.

"Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is commonly associated with motor impairments, neuropathic pain, fatigue, mood disorders, and decreased life expectancy. However, preclinical pharmacological studies predominantly rely on clinical scoring of motor deficit as the sole behavioral endpoint. Thus, the translational potential of these studies is limited. Here, we have assessed the therapeutic potential of a novel anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) non-viral gene therapy formulation (XT-101-R) in a rat relapsing remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. EAE induced motor deficits and neuropathic pain as reflected by induction of low-threshold mechanical allodynia, suppressed voluntary wheel running, decreased social exploration, and was associated with markedly enhanced mortality. We also noted that voluntary wheel running was depressed prior to the onset of motor deficit, and may therefore serve as a predictor of clinical symptoms onset. XT-101-R was intrathecally dosed only once at the onset of motor deficits, and attenuated each of the EAE-induced symptoms and improved survival, relative to vehicle control. This is the first pharmacological assessment of such a broad range of EAE symptoms, and provides support for IL-10 gene therapy as a clinical strategy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

"Maintenance of a persistent foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) infection in BHK-21 cells involves a coevolution of cells and virus (J. C. de la Torre, E. Martínez-Salas, J. Díez, A. Villaverde, F. Gebauer, E. Rocha, M. Dávila, and E. Domingo, J. Virol. 62:2050-2058, 1988). The resident FMDV undergoes a number of phenotypic changes, including a gradual decrease in virion stability. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of the P1 genomic segment of the virus rescued after 100 passages of the carrier cells (R100). Only 5 of 15 mutations in P1 of R100 were silent. Nine amino acid substitutions were fixed on the viral capsid during persistence, and three of the variant amino acids are not represented in the corresponding position of any picornavirus sequenced to date. Cysteine at position 7 of VP3, that provides disulfide bridges at the FMDV fivefold axis, was substituted by valine, as determined by RNA, cDNA, and protein sequencing. The modified virus shows high buoyant density in cesium chloride and depicts the same sensitivity to photoinactivation by intercalating dyes as the parental FMDV C-S8c1. Amino acid substitutions fixed in VP1 resulted in altered antigenicity, as revealed by reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. In addition to defining at the molecular level the alterations the FMDV capsid underwent during persistence, the results show that positions which are highly invariant in an RNA genome may change when viral replication occurs in a modified environment.

"Studies focused on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in recovery or progression to chronicity of HBV may take advantage of natural and experimental models that mimic its properties. This is also of relevance for associated diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellulocarcinoma. The eastern woodchuck (Marmota monax) infected by the hepadnavirus woodchuck Hepatitis B virus (WHV) has been applied as a predictive model to support development of new HBV vaccines, antivirals, immunotherapies and combination therapies. This report summarizes studies carried out by our and other groups, with the application of this model in natural and experimental infections. Using standardized viral inocula in neonate and adult animals and newly established assays, the presence of the specific patterns of markers of acute, chronic and resolved infections and their relationships in the different virus-host interactions have been shown. B and T cell responses and T(H)1 cytokine expression have been shown to play a crucial role in the outcome of infection. The availability of the WHV/Marmota monax model and specific standardized assays may allow evaluation of new formulations of multimodal therapeutic strategies based on antiviral chemotherapy and immunomodulation. These may also include specifically targeted immunocomplexes. Such therapies could constitute new frontiers for the treatment of HBV chronic disease.

"The human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 oncoprotein rapidly induces centrosome duplication errors in primary human cells, thereby increasing the propensity for multipolar mitoses, which can lead to chromosome missegregation and aneuploidy. We analyzed a series of HPV-16 E7 mutants and demonstrate that this biological activity of the E7 oncoprotein is mediated by sequences encompassing the core pRB binding site but is independent of its ability to inactivate the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein pRB and the related pocket proteins p107 and p130. In addition, interaction of E7 with the S4 subunit of the 26S proteasome and dysregulation of cdc25A transcription are also dispensable for the induction of centrosome duplication errors. Consistent with these results, expression of HPV-16 E7 induces abnormal centrosome duplication in a cell line that lacks functional pRB and in mouse embryo fibroblasts that are deficient for pRB, p107, and p130. These results demonstrate that the molecular mechanism whereby HPV-16 E7 induces centrosome duplication errors is independent of its ability to inactivate pRB, p107, and p130 or to interact with the S4 proteasome subunit.

"The early stages of picornavirus capsid assembly and the host factors involved are poorly understood. Since the localisation of viral proteins in infected cells can provide information on their function, antibodies against purified Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) GDVII capsids were generated by immunisation of rabbits. The resultant anti-TMEV capsid antibodies recognised a C-terminal region of VP1 but not VP2 or VP3 by Western analysis. Examination of the sites of TMEV capsid assembly by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy showed that at 5h post infection, capsid signal was diffusely cytoplasmic with strong perinuclear staining and moved into large punctate structures from 6 to 8h post infection. A plaque reduction neutralisation assay showed that the anti-TMEV capsid antibodies but not anti-VP1 antibodies could neutralise viral infection in vitro. The VP1 C-terminal residues recognised by the anti-TMEV capsid antibodies were mapped to a loop on the capsid surface near to the putative receptor binding pocket. In silico docking experiments showed that the known TMEV co-receptor, heparan sulfate, interacts with residues of VP1 in the putative receptor binding pocket, residues of VP3 in the adjacent pit and residues of the adjoining VP1 C-terminal loop which is recognised by the anti-TMEV capsid antibodies. These findings suggest that the anti-TMEV capsid antibodies neutralise virus infection by preventing heparan sulfate from binding to the capsid. The antibodies produced in this study are an important tool for further investigating virus-host cell interactions essential to picornavirus assembly.

"The crystal structure of the Fab fragment from the monoclonal anti-preS2 antibody F124 (IgG1,kappa) has been solved by molecular replacement and refined at 3.0 A resolution. The Fab crystallizes with two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. F124 recognizes an epitope contained within the preS2 segment between residues 120 and 132 of the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus. The antibody shows a high affinity for the glycan N-linked to Asn123, but it also cross-reacts with the non-glycosylated peptide fragment 120-132. Although crystallization was performed in the presence of an eightfold excess of the cross-reactive peptide, no evidence for the ligand was found in the antigen-binding site, which is close to a neighbouring molecule in the crystal lattice. The antigen-binding site has a groove-like topology which is modulated with pocket-like cavities. It is characterized by a large number of tyrosine and aspartate residues. The importance of germ-line mutations at the binding site is discussed.

"The murine class I molecule H-2Kb and its natural gene conversion variant, H-2Kbm8, which differs from H-2Kb solely at 4 aa at the bottom of the peptide-binding B pocket, are expressed in coisogenic mouse strains C57BL/6 (B6) and B6.C-H-2bm8 (bm8). These two strains provide an excellent opportunity to study the effects of Mhc class I polymorphism on the T cell repertoire. We recently discovered a gain in the antiviral CTL repertoire in bm8 mice as a consequence of the emergence of the Mhc class I allele H-2Kbm8. In this report we sought to determine the mechanism behind the generation of this increased CTL diversity. Our results demonstrate that repertoire diversification occurred by a gain in intrathymic positive selection. As previously shown, the emergence of the same Mhc allele also caused a loss in positive selection of T cell repertoire specific for another Ag, OVA-8. This indicates that a reciprocal loss-and-gain pattern of intrathymic selection exists between H-2Kb and H-2Kbm8. Therefore, in the thymus of an individual, a new Mhc allele can select new T cell specificities, while abandoning some T cell specificities selected by the wild-type allele. A byproduct of this repertoire shift is a net gain of T cell repertoire of the species, which is likely to improve its survival fitness.

"INTRODUCTION: Because of iron overload complications, thrombosis and infectious predisposition, patients with severe forms of thalassemia are likely to be at increased risk of COVID-19 complications. RESULTS: A national survey conducted during the year 2020 across the French reference centers for hemoglobinopathies identified 16 cases of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR in beta-thalassemia patients. Their age ranged from 11 months to 60 years. 15 patients were transfusion-dependent and 6 were splenectomized. Concerning iron overload related complications, none had diabetes or cirrhosis and only one had experienced heart failure. All 4 pediatric patients were pauci-symptomatic during the viral episode. Three patients (41, 49 and 57 years old) developed COVID-19 pneumonia requiring oxygen therapy without the need for mechanical ventilation. Neutropenia (absolute neutrophils count <0.5 10 (9)/L) was observed in 2 patients receiving long-term treatment with hydroxycarbamide and deferiprone. No thrombosis event, organ failure or death occurred. All patients recovered. CONCLUSION: Severity of COVID-19 in this population of young and middle-aged patients appeared increased compared to the general population but remained mild to moderate as already described in the few series reported in the literature. Occurrence of adverse events related to chronic treatment administered in thalassemia disease may be favored by the infectious episode.

"Zoonotic diseases, caused by pathogens transmitted between other vertebrate animals and humans, pose a major risk to human health. Rodents are important reservoir hosts for many zoonotic pathogens, and rodent population dynamics affect the infection dynamics of rodent-borne diseases, such as diseases caused by hantaviruses. However, the role of rodent population dynamics in determining the infection dynamics of rodent-associated tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis (LB), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria, have gained limited attention in Northern Europe, despite the multiannual abundance fluctuations, the so-called vole cycles, that characterise rodent population dynamics in the region. Here, we quantify the associations between rodent abundance and LB human cases and Puumala Orthohantavirus (PUUV) infections by using two time series (25-year and 9-year) in Finland. Both bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance as well as LB and PUUV infection incidence in humans showed approximately 3-year cycles. Without vector transmitted PUUV infections followed the bank vole host abundance fluctuations with two-month time lag, whereas tick-transmitted LB was associated with bank vole abundance ca. 12 and 24 months earlier. However, the strength of association between LB incidence and bank vole abundance ca. 12 months before varied over the study years. This study highlights that the human risk to acquire rodent-borne pathogens, as well as rodent-associated tick-borne pathogens is associated with the vole cycles in Northern Fennoscandia, yet with complex time lags.

"In the receptor for ecotropic murine leukemia viruses, tyrosine 235 contributes a critical hydrophobic side chain to the virus-receptor interaction (14). Here we report that tryptophan 142 in ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus envelope protein is essential to virus binding and infection. Replacement of tryptophan 142 by alanine or serine resulted in misfolding. However, replacement by methionine (W142M) allowed correct folding of the majority of glycoprotein molecules. W142M virus showed a marked reduction in virus binding and was almost noninfectious, suggesting that tryptophan 142 is involved in receptor binding. In contrast, W142Y virus containing a replacement of tryptophan 142 with an aromatic residue (tyrosine) was as efficient as wild-type virus in infection and binding of cells expressing the wild-type receptor. However, W142Y virus was 100-fold less efficient than wild-type virus in infection of cells expressing a mutant receptor containing tryptophan instead of the critical tyrosine. These results strongly support tryptophan 142 being an essential residue on the virus envelope protein that interacts directly with the critical hydrophobic residue at position 235 of the ecotropic receptor. Tryptophan 142 forms one side of a shallow hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the envelope protein, suggesting that it might comprise the complete putative binding site for tyrosine 235. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to two models of the envelope protein trimer. Interestingly, both models place tryptophan 142 at the interface between adjacent subunits of the trimer.

"The European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a notorious economic and environmental pest species in its invasive range. To better understand the population and range dynamics of this species, 41 yr of abundance data have been collected from 116 unique sites across a broad range of climatic and environmental conditions in Australia. We analyzed this time series of abundance data to determine whether interannual variation in climatic conditions can be used to map historic, contemporary, and potential future fluctuations in rabbit abundance from regional to continental scales. We constructed a hierarchical Bayesian regression model of relative abundance that corrected for observation error and seasonal biases. The corrected abundances were regressed against environmental and disease variables in order to project high spatiotemporal resolution, continent-wide rabbit abundances. We show that rabbit abundance in Australia is highly variable in space and time, being driven primarily by internnual variation in temperature and precipitation in concert with the prevalence of a non-pathogenic virus. Moreover, we show that internnual variation in local spatial abundances can be mapped effectively at a continental scale using highly resolved spatiotemporal predictors, allowing ""hot spots"" of persistently high rabbit abundance to be identified. Importantly, cross-validated model performance was fair to excellent within and across distinct climate zones. Long-term monitoring data for invasive species can be used to map fine-scale spatiotemporal fluctuations in abundance patterns when accurately accounting for inherent sampling biases. Our analysis provides ecologists and pest managers with a clearer understanding of the determinants of rabbit abundance in Australia, offering an important new approach for predicting spatial abundance patterns of invasive species at the near-term temporal scales that are directly relevant to resource management.

"To study genetic changes underlying myxoma virus evolution in its new host, the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), we sequenced selected genomic regions of nine recent virulent field strains and a live attenuated vaccine strain (""MAV"", Germany). DNA was extracted from cell culture passaged myxoma virus. A total of 4863 bp (approximately 3% of the genome) of 10 regions spanning 12 genes of the myxoma viruses was sequenced and compared to the original virulent strain ""Lausanne"" and its attenuated field derivative strain ""6918"". The field strains displayed a maximum of three (strains C43, C95) and a minimum of one (strains CD01, CD05) nucleotide substitutions. These were distributed through all analysed coding regions, except gene M022L (major envelope protein), where all strains were identical to ""Lausanne"" and ""6918"". Two new single nucleotide insertions were observed in some of the field strains: within the intergenic region M014L/M015L and within gene M009L, where it leads to a frameshift. These insertions were located after homopolymeric regions. The vaccine strain displayed 37 nucleotide substitutions, predominantly (95%) located in genes M022L and M036L. Interestingly, regions M009L and M014L/M015L of the vaccine were not amplified successfully, suggesting major genomic changes that could account for its attenuated phenotype. Our results support a high degree of genetic stability of myxoma virus over the past five decades. None of the analysed genome regions by its own seems sufficient for the genetic characterisation of field strains.

"Two pairs of Sindbis virus (SV) variants that differ in their neuroinvasive and neurovirulent traits in mice have been isolated. Recently, we mapped the genetic determinants responsible for neuroinvasiveness in weanling mice. Here, we extend this study to newborn and adult rats and to rat neuronal cultures. Remarkably, certain aspects of the pathogenesis of these strains in rats were found to be quite distinct from the mouse model. Suckling rats were susceptible to all four isolates, and replication in the brain was observed after both intraperitoneal and intracranial (i.c.) inoculation. None of the isolates was neuroinvasive in adult rats, although all replicated after i.c. inoculation. For the isolate pair that was highly neurovirulent in mice, SVN and SVNI, only SVNI caused death after i.c. inoculation of adult rats. Similarly, only SVNI was cytotoxic for primary cultures of mature neurons. The genetic determinants responsible for the pathogenic properties of SVNI were mapped to the E2 glycoprotein and the 5' noncoding region (5'NCR). Substitution of two amino acids in SVN E2 with the corresponding residues of SVNI (Met-190 and Lys-260) led to paralysis in 3- and 5-week-old rats. More dramatically, a single substitution in the 5'NCR of SVN (G at position 8) transformed the virus into a lethal pathogen for 3-week-old rats like SVNI. In 5-week-old rats, however, this recombinant was attenuated relative to SVNI by 2 orders of magnitude. Combination of the E2 and 5'NCR determinants resulted in a recombinant with virulence properties indistinguishable from those of SVNI. These data indicate that the 5'NCR and E2 play an instrumental role in determining the age-dependent pathogenic properties of SV in rats.

"Two subunits of influenza hemagglutinin (HA), HA1 and HA2, represent one of the best-characterized membrane fusion machines. While a low pH conformation of HA2 mediates the actual fusion, HA1 establishes a specific connection between the viral and cell membranes via binding to the sialic acid-containing receptors. Here we propose that HA1 may also be involved in modulating the kinetics of HA refolding. We hypothesized that binding of the HA1 subunit to its receptor restricts the major refolding of the low pH-activated HA to a fusion-competent conformation and, in the absence of fusion, to an HA-inactivated state. Dissociation of the HA1-receptor connection was considered to be a slow kinetic step. To verify this hypothesis, we first analyzed a simple kinetic scheme accounting for the stages of dissociation of the HA1/receptor bonds, inactivation and fusion, and formulated experimentally testable predictions. Second, we verified these predictions by measuring the extent of fusion between HA-expressing cells and red blood cells. Three experimental approaches based on 1) the temporal inhibition of fusion by lysophosphatidylcholine, 2) rapid dissociation of the HA1-receptor connections by neuraminidase treatment, and 3) substitution of membrane-anchored receptors by a water-soluble sialyllactose all provided support for the proposed role of the release of HA1-receptor connections. Possible biological implications of this stage in HA refolding and membrane fusion are being discussed.

"This article sought to estimate the prevalence of vaccine hesitancy (VH) among French general practitioners (GPs) and to study its demographic, professional and personal correlates. We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey about GPs' vaccination-related attitudes and practices in 2014 in a national panel of 1,712 GPs in private practice, randomly selected from an exhaustive database of health professionals in France. A cluster analysis of various dimensions of VH (self-reported vaccine recommendations, perceptions of vaccine risks and usefulness) identified three clusters: 86% of GPs (95% confidence interval (CI): 84-88) were not or only slightly vaccine-hesitant, 11% (95% CI: 9-12) moderately hesitant and 3% (95% CI: 3-4) highly hesitant or opposed to vaccination. GPs in the latter two clusters were less frequently vaccinated and reported occasional practice of alternative medicine more often than those in the first cluster; they also described less experience with vaccine-preventable diseases and more experience with patients who they considered had serious adverse effects from vaccination. This study confirms the presence of VH among French GPs but also suggests that its prevalence is moderate. Given GPs' central role in vaccination, these results nevertheless call for a mobilisation of stakeholders to address VH among GPs.

"Plant viral vectors allow expression of heterologous proteins at high yields, but so far, they have been unable to express heterooligomeric proteins efficiently. We describe here a rapid and indefinitely scalable process for high-level expression of functional full-size mAbs of the IgG class in plants. The process relies on synchronous coinfection and coreplication of two viral vectors, each expressing a separate antibody chain. The two vectors are derived from two different plant viruses that were found to be noncompeting. Unlike vectors derived from the same virus, noncompeting vectors effectively coexpress the heavy and light chains in the same cell throughout the plant body, resulting in yields of up to 0.5 g of assembled mAbs per kg of fresh-leaf biomass. This technology allows production of gram quantities of mAbs for research purposes in just several days, and the same protocol can be used on an industrial scale in situations requiring rapid response, such as pandemic or terrorism events.

"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is a key regulator of muscle development and metabolism in chickens. Recently, we have demonstrated that intracerebroventricular administration of IGF-1 significantly decreased food intake in broiler chicks. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the IGF-1-induced anorexia and the anorexigenic effect of IGF-1 in different strains of commercial chicks have not been investigated. Neuropeptide Y (NPY, a hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptide), agouti-related protein (AgRP, a hypothalamic orexigenic neuropeptide), and proopiomelanocortin (POMC, the precursor of hypothalamic anorexigenic neuropeptides) play important roles in the regulation of food intake in both mammals and chickens. Evidence shows that several cell signaling pathways in the hypothalamus are involved in regulating the feeding behavior of mammals. In the present study, we first investigated the effects of IGF-1 on the expression of appetite-regulating neuropeptides and phosphorylation of signaling molecules in the hypothalamus of broiler chicks. Intracerebroventricular administration of IGF-1 significantly increased the mRNA levels of POMC, whereas the mRNA levels of NPY and AgRP were not significantly altered. IGF-1 also significantly induced the phosphorylation of v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT) in the hypothalamus of chicks, but did not influence the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1, S6 protein, AMP-activated protein kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. We also compared the effect of IGF-1 on food intake in broiler chicks (a hyperphagic strain of chickens) and layer chicks. Results demonstrated that the threshold of IGF-1-induced anorexia in broiler chicks was higher than that in layer chicks. Our observations suggest that hypothalamic POMC and AKT may be involved in the IGF-1-induced anorexigenic pathway and that high threshold of IGF-1-induced anorexia in broiler chicks might be one of the causes of hyperphagia in broiler chicks. Overall, it appears that IGF-1 plays important roles in the central regulation of feeding behavior in chicks.

"The first known epizootic of rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) occurred in two free-living wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) populations at Doñana National Park, Spain. Rabbit population density was not correlated to RHD mortality. Only adult animals were affected; males and females had similar mortality rates.

"The HIV-1 transgenic (TG) rat has been shown to be a useful model of nervous system disease that occurs in human HIV-1 infection. Studies were, therefore, performed to examine characteristics of the immune response in the periphery and brain of the animals and expression of factors in the nervous system that might be associated with neurotoxicity. Activated splenocytes from wild-type (WT) and TG rats were stimulated with either CD3/CD28 or with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and examined for proliferative responses and for proinflammatory cytokine (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1β) secretion. Brain tissue lysates from the rats were also examined for proinflammatory cytokine levels and tissue sections were stained by immunofluorescence for class II MHC+, ED1+ or Iba1+ (for macrophages and microglial cells), and for GFAP+ (for astrocytes) cells and for co-labeling of these cells for TNF-α. Co-labeling was also performed to identify cells expressing HIV-1 gp160, tat, nef and vif. Finally, on Western blots brain tissue lysates were examined for phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38, JNK-SAPK and Erk5. TG rat splenocyte proliferative responses were higher than for WT with CD3/CD28-stimulation but lower than WT with LPS stimulation. CD3/CD28-stimulated TG rat splenocytes also secreted higher levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1β whereas LPS-stimulated TG rat splenocytes secreted higher levels of only TNF-α than cultures from WT rats. Levels of all three cytokines were higher in brain lysates from TG rats than for WT rats. On immunofluorescence staining of corresponding sections of brain, TG rats contained increased numbers of class II MHC+ and ED1+ cells, and there was also increased co-labeling or these cells as well as astrocytes for TNF-α. Iba1+ cells showed positive staining for all of the HIV proteins whereas astrocytes showed significant positive staining for only nef and vif. Phosphorylation of Erk1/2, p38 and JNK/SAPK was detected for both TG and WT rat tissues with higher levels of phosphorylation forms of these proteins detected in the TG rat brain. Phosphorylation of Erk5, a marker that is associated with specifically neuronal repair, was detected only in TG rat brain. These studies suggest that activated nervous system mononuclear phagocytes and astrocytes expressing HIV-1 gene products in specific patterns are associated with neurodegeneration in the HIV-1 TG rat.

"Regulation of E2F1-mediated apoptosis is essential for proper cellular growth. This control requires TopBP1, a BRCT (BRCA1 carboxyl-terminal) domain-containing protein, which interacts with E2F1 but not other E2Fs and represses its proapoptotic activity. We now show that the regulation of E2F1 by TopBP1 involves the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway, and is independent of pocket proteins. Akt phosphorylates TopBP1 in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylation by Akt induces oligomerization of TopBP1 through its seventh and eighth BRCT domains. The Akt-dependent oligomerization is crucial for TopBP1 to interact with and repress E2F1. Akt phosphorylation is also required for interaction between TopBP1 and Miz1 or HPV16 E2, and repression of Miz1 transcriptional activity, suggesting a general role for TopBP1 oligomerization in the control of transcription factors. Together, this study defines a novel pathway involving PI3K-Akt-TopBP1 for specific control of E2F1 apoptosis, in parallel with cyclin-Cdk-Rb for general control of E2F activities.

"Background. In 2013, the tuberculosis (TB) mortality rate was highest in southern Zimbabwe at 16%. We therefore sought to determine factors associated with mortality among registered TB patients in this region. Methodology. This was a retrospective record review of registered patients receiving anti-TB treatment in 2013. Results. Of 1,971 registered TB patients, 1,653 (84%) were new cases compared with 314 (16%) retreatment cases. There were 1,538 (78%) TB/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfected patients, of whom 1,399 (91%) were on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with median pre-ART CD4 count of 133 cells/uL (IQR, 46-282). Overall, 428 (22%) TB patients died. Factors associated with increased mortality included being ≥65 years old [adjusted relative risk (ARR) = 2.48 (95% CI 1.35-4.55)], a retreatment TB case [ARR = 1.34 (95% CI, 1.10-1.63)], and being HIV-positive [ARR = 1.87 (95% CI, 1.44-2.42)] whilst ART initiation was protective [ARR = 0.25 (95% CI, 0.22-0.29)]. Cumulative mortality rates were 10%, 14%, and 21% at one, two, and six months, respectively, after starting TB treatment. Conclusion. There was high mortality especially in the first two months of anti-TB treatment, with risk factors being recurrent TB and being HIV-infected, despite a high uptake of ART.

"This paper reports the establishment of a model for hantavirus host adaptation. Wild-type (wt) (bank vole-passaged) and Vero E6 cell-cultured variants of Puumala virus strain Kazan were analyzed for their virologic and genetic properties. The wt variant was well adapted for reproduction in bank voles but not in cell culture, while the Vero E6 strains replicated to much higher efficiency in cell culture but did not reproducibly infect bank voles. Comparison of the consensus sequences of the respective viral genomes revealed no differences in the coding region of the S gene. However, the noncoding regions of the S gene were found to be different at positions 26 and 1577. In one additional and independent adaptation experiment, all analyzed cDNA clones from the Vero E6-adapted variant were found to carry substitutions at position 1580 of the S segment, just 3 nucleotides downstream of the mutation observed in the first adaptation. No differences were found in the consensus sequences of the entire M segments from the wt and the Vero E6-adapted variants. The results indicated different impacts of the S and the M genomic segments for the adaptation process and selective advantages for the variants that carried altered noncoding sequences of the S segment. We conclude that the isolation in cell culture resulted in a phenotypically and genotypically altered hantavirus.

"We examined host usage and seasonal activity patterns of the nymphal stage of the ticks Ixodes kingi and I. sculptus within a prairie rodent community in north-central Colorado. Ixodes kingi was commonly encountered on both northern grasshopper mice (Onychomys leucogaster) and thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus), whereas I. sculptus frequently infested S. tridecemlineatus but was absent from O. leucogaster. Low numbers of ticks of both species were collected from deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and Ord's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii). Nymphal loads of I. kingi and I. sculptus increased dramatically on commonly infested rodent species from spring (May-June) to summer (July-August). Further, rodents trapped on prairie-dog towns tended to experience increased nymphal loads of I. kingi (O. leucogaster, S. tridecemlineatus) but decreased loads of I. sculptus (S. tridecemlineatus) following plague epizootics among prairie dog populations. A summary of published North American host records revealed that I. kingi has been recorded from humans, domestic animals (cat, dog), 17 species of carnivores, 40 species of rodents, and four species of lagomorphs, and that I. sculptus has been recorded from humans, domestic animals (cat, dog, goat), 13 species of carnivores, 34 species of rodents, and three species of lagomorphs. In accordance with our observations from Colorado, I. kingi commonly has been found to infest heteromyid and murid rodents (such as grasshopper mice), whereas I. sculptus most frequently has been collected from ground-dwelling sciurid rodents, especially Spermophilus ground squirrels. The potential roles of I. kingi and I. sculptus as enzootic vectors of human pathogens, particularly the agents of tularemia (Francisella tularensis), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), and Colorado tick fever (CTF virus), are discussed.

"Synthetic and natural amphiphiles, octyl glucoside, Nonidet P40, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), gangliosides GM1 and GD1a, interact with cholera toxin (CLT) and with its active region (promoter A). The formation of CLT-amphiphile complex leads to inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, a characteristic of promoter A elicited after thiol-reagents treatment. In all cases the interaction produces the maximum inhibitory effect above the critical micellar concentration of amphiphiles, although monomers of SDS show inhibition activity as well. The gangliosides appear to be capable of altering bilayer organization of membrane, similar to synthetic detergents. When CLT-ganglioside complexes were incubated with cell culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was completely restored both in cholera toxin and in promoter A. Some protein of FCS, which is avid of gangliosides, seems to be responsible for reversibility of inhibition. The results indicate that the active site of promoter A may be located in a hydrophobic pocket of the toxin structure. Furthermore, CLT was bound to reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes (RSVEs), containing a small amount of GM1. The RSVEs are made of membranous vesicles, capable of binding and fusing with host cell membrane. The incubation for 1 1hr of RSVE bearing CLT with Friend's erythroleukemic cells produced the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. This stimulation appears to be due to the translocation of the active subunit of CLT in the inner half of plasma membrane.

"While trying to generate a site-directed deletion in the ORF63 latency-associated gene of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) Oka, we constructed a virus with an unexpected rearrangement. The virus has a small deletion in both copies of ORF63 and two copies of a cassette inserted between ORFs 64/65 and 68/69 containing (a) truncated ORF62, (b) ORF63 with a small deletion, and (c) full-length ORF64. The virus was not impaired for growth in human cells, induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in guinea pigs, and was impaired for latency in cotton rats compared with parental virus (p = 0.0022). Additional mutants containing the same truncation in ORF62, with or without the ORF63 deletion, were less impaired for latency. A VZV Oka mutant, replicating to similar titers and inducing a comparable immune response as parental virus, but impaired for latency, might serve as a safer vaccine and be less likely to reactivate to cause zoster. © 2010.

"We three authors, the two past presidents (HWL and AV) and the current president (CSS) of the International Society for Hantaviruses (ISH) have attended most of the nine International Conferences on HFRS, HPS and Hantaviruses (Table 1). These conferences have provided a forum for a synergistic group of clinicians, basic researchers, mammalogists, epidemiologists and ecologists to share their expertise and interests in all aspects of hantavirus research. Much of what is now hantavirus dogma was only conjecture when HWL organized the first conference in Seoul, Korea in 1989. Herein, we provide our reflections on key events in hantavirus research. As we come from distinct areas of the world and have had individual historical experiences, we certainly have our own geocentric opinions about the key events. Nevertheless, we agree that the discovery of hantaviruses has taken an interesting and unpredictable track to where we are today. © 2014 .

"The factors involved in the establishment of persistent hepadnavirus infection are poorly understood. Re-cent findings demonstrate that the sequence of the genome of hepatitis B virus (HBV) is variable in infected individuals and that, in some cases, virus mutants predominate. Our objectives in the present study were to analyze the variability of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) genomes in an infected animal and to determine whether sequence heterogeneity played a critical role in the ability of WHV to induce chronic infection. We cloned and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of three supercoiled genomes from an animal that became infected after inoculation with a standardized WHV serum pool (i.e., the WHV7 virus pool). We found that there were four nucleotide substitutions among the three genome sequences as well as a 73-nucleotide deletion in one of the recombinants. DNA transfection experiments revealed that only one of the three recombinants was capable of independent replication. These data suggest that a significant proportion of replicative templates in woodchucks that are infected with WHV are defective virus genomes. Next, we compared the outcome of acute infection after inoculation with a serum pool containing a uniform population of replication competent virus (i.e., the WHV7R pool) with a serum pool composed of WHV genomes of variable sequence. The WHV7R serum pool originated from a woodchuck that became a chronic carrier after in vivo transfection of the liver with the infectious WHV7 recombinant. Neonatal woodchucks were inoculated with 5 × 106 WHV genome equivalents of either the WHV7 pool or the WHV7R Pool. All animals in the study became acutely infected with WHV. Of the animals infected with the WHV7 serum pool, 65% became chronic carriers, while 80% of the animals Infected with the WHV7R serum pool developed chronic infection. Thus, infection of woodchucks with a serum pool containing defective virus resulted in a rate of chronic WHV infection that was similar to, or even lower than, a rate from a pool containing only wild-type virus. This suggests that the presence of defective virus in the inoculum is not a prerequisite for the establishment of persistent hepadnavirus infections.

"New data suggest there is a huge opportunity for EDs to identify patients with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and link them into care before downstream complications lead to higher medical costs and adverse outcomes. Early results from a pilot study at the University of Alabama Medical Center in Birmingham show that at least 12% of the targeted baby boomer population being screened for HCV in the ED is testing positive for HCV, with confirmatory tests showing that about 9% of the screened population is infected with the disease. Both the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommend one-time HCV screening for patients who were born between 1945 and 1965. Public health experts say 75% of HCV infections occur in patients born during the baby boomer years, and that roughly half of them are unaware of their HCV status. Researchers at UAB report that so many patients are testing positive for HCV that demand for care can quickly overwhelm the health system if new primary care/specialty resources are not identified. Administrators of ED-based HCV screening programs in both Birmingham and Houston note that EDs with existing screening programs for HIV should have the easiest time implementing HCV screening. They also stress that patients are more accepting of HCV screening, and that the counseling process is easier.

"Epidemiological studies show an association between early exposure to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the development or exacerbation of asthma. This idea is supported by studies in mice that demonstrate worsened airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) when RSV-infected animals are exposed to allergen. The effect of allergen on RSV disease, however, has not been reported. Cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) that have been used as a model to study RSV pathogenesis were sensitized to extracts of Aspergillus fumigatus (Af), a common household mould. The allergic response to Af included eosinophilia, formation of granulomas and induction of Th2 type cytokines. RSV infection prior to allergen challenge resulted in exacerbation of the inflammatory response as well as increased airway responsiveness to methacholine. The exacerbated response was indeed dependent on virus replication. Virus replication in turn was influenced by the allergic response, with persistence in the noses for 2 days longer in animals challenged with allergen. This diminished clearance corresponded to decreased induction of mRNA for IFN-γ, a Th1-type cytokine that is characteristic of viral infection. Treatment of RSV-infected Af-challenged animals with recombinant IFN-γ reduced the allergic inflammatory response as well as the relative levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokine mRNA. However, this treatment did not reduce airway reactivity, showing that these pathologic and physiologic measures of exacerbated disease are independent. We speculate that the reciprocal effect of the allergic response on viral immunity may benefit the host by limiting exacerbation of physiologic responses that are IFN-γ-dependent. © 2007 The Author(s).

"Background: Human infections with Sin Nombre virus (SNV) and related New World hantaviruses often lead to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a sometimes fatal illness. Lungs of patients who die from HCPS exhibit cytokine-producing mononuclear infiltrates and pronounced pulmonary inflammation. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are the principal natural hosts of SNV, in which the virus establishes life-long persistence without conspicuous pathology. Little is known about the mechanisms SNV employs to evade the immune response of deer mice, and experimental examination of this question has been difficult because of a lack of methodologies for examining such responses during infection. One such deficiency is our inability to characterize T cell responses because susceptible syngeneic deer mice are not available. Results: To solve this problem, we have developed an in vitro method of expanding and generating competent antigen presenting cells (APC) from deer mouse bone marrow using commercially-available house mouse (Mus musculus) granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. These cells are capable of processing and presenting soluble protein to antigen-specific autologous helper T cells in vitro. Inclusion of antigen-specific deer mouse antibody augments T cell stimulation, presumably through Fc receptor-mediated endocytosis. Conclusions: The use of these APC has allowed us to dramatically expand deer mouse helper T cells in culture and should permit extensive characterization of T cell epitopes. Considering the evolutionary divergence between deer mice and house mice, it is probable that this method will be useful to other investigators using unconventional models of rodent-borne diseases. © 2004 Davenport et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends 1-time hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening of all baby boomers (born 1945-1965). However, little is known about optimal ways to implement HCV screening, counseling, and linkage to care. We developed strategies following approaches used for HIV to implement baby boomer HCV screening in a hospital setting and report results as well as costs. DESIGN/PATIENTS: Prospective cohort of 6140 baby boomers admitted to a safety-net hospital in South Texas from December 1, 2012 to January 31, 2014 and followed to December 10, 2014. PROCEDURES/MEASUREMENTS: The HCV screening program included clinician/staff education, electronic medical record algorithm for eligibility and order entry, opt-out consent, anti-HCV antibody test with reflex HCV RNA, personalized inpatient counseling, and outpatient case management. Outcomes were anti-HCV antibody-positive and HCV RNA-positive results. RESULTS: Of 3168 eligible patients, 240 (7.6%) were anti-HCV positive, which was more likely (P<0.05) for younger age, men, and uninsured. Of 214 (89.2%) patients tested for HCV RNA, 134 (4.2% of all screened) were positive (chronic HCV). Among patients with chronic HCV, 129 (96.3%) were counseled, 108 (80.6%) received follow-up primary care, and 52 (38.8%) received hepatology care. Five patients initiated anti-HCV therapy. Total costs for start-up and implementation for 14 months were $286,482. CONCLUSIONS: This inpatient HCV screening program diagnosed chronic HCV infection in 4.2% of tested patients and linked >80% to follow-up care. Yet access to therapy is challenging for largely uninsured populations, and most programmatic costs of the program are not currently covered.

"An outbreak of illness associated with hantavirus infection continues to be investigated by state health departments in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah; the Indian Health Service; and CDC, with the assistance of the Navajo Nation Division of Health. This report updates information regarding the outbreak and presents information on two cases that occurred in the 10 months preceding this outbreak.

"Full length cDNAs for p53 were made by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of total RNA from two normal woodchuck livers. Two randomly chosen clones from each liver were sequenced and shown to be identical. This sequence revealed 80% or more identity with p53 sequences from human, monkey, and mouse. The cDNA was translated into a ~55 kD protein in vitro that was immunoprecipitated by antibodies to p53. Cotranslation of woodchuck p53 with woodchuck hepatitis virus X antigen, followed by immunoprecipitation suggested X/p53 complex formation. Similar complexes were also immunoprecipitated from extracts of infected liver, but not from uninfected liver. The finding of X/p53 complexes in vivo and in vitro in the woodchuck hepadnavirus system, combined with analogous data with hepatitis B, suggests a common mechanism by which these viruses contribute to hepatocellular transformation.

"At the 2018 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections (CROI), there was a major focus on hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination and improving each component of the hepatitis C care cascade. Several countries and cohorts have demonstrated the remarkable impact that universal HCV testing and unrestricted access to hepatitis C treatment can have on markedly reducing incident HCV infections and HCV infection prevalence, including in people who inject drugs and HIV/HCV-coinfected populations. However, in many settings, substantial barriers to widespread HCV treatment remain, including undiagnosed HCV infection, particularly in populations outside the standard “baby boomer” birth cohort (ie, born 1945-1965); restricted access to hepatitis C treatment in those with known HCV infection; reinfection with HCV; and migration of HCV-infected populations. Many innovative programs have successfully implemented HCV testing and treatment outside of traditional care settings, expanding access for harder-to-reach populations, which will be crucial to successful elimination efforts. Outbreaks of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection continue to occur in among men who have sex with men and homeless populations in the United States, Europe, and Southeast Asia, highlighting the need for improved HAV vaccination programs for populations at risk.

"Apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) is the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles in serum, and participates in the reverse transport of cholesterol from tissues to the liver for excretion. The natural HDL tropism to the liver and cancer cells has been used extensively to target encapsulated drugs. The alteration of the plasmatic isoforms of ApoA-I is a hallmark of chronic hepatitis and hepatocarcinoma in mice and humans. Woodchucks infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) represent the best animal model for the study of chronic viral hepatitis B and viral induced hepatocarcinoma (HCC). WHV-infected woodchuck represents a clinically relevant animal model under which new treatment strategies can be evaluated and optimized. Therapeutic efficacy in this model is likely to be translated into a successful therapy for patients infected with HBV. The present study describes, for the first time, the cloning and characterization of woodchuck ApoA-I. The open reading frame (ORF) of the woodchuck ApoA-I is 795bp long, coding for 264 amino acids. Unexpectedly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the closest sequences are those of human and macaque. Woodchuck HDLs were isolated successfully from sera by density gradient ultracentrifugation. A commercial antibody that recognized the woodchuck ApoA-I was also identified. Finally, taking advantage of the techniques and tools developed in this study, two potential applications of woodchuck HDLs are illustrated: drug delivery to a woodchuck hepatocarcinoma cell line and the use of isoelectrofocusing to identify ApoA-I isoforms. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

"Natural killer (NK) cells play major roles in innate immunity against viruses and cancer. Natural killer receptors (NKR) expressed by NK cells recognize foreign- or self-ligands on infected and transformed cells as well as healthy cells. NKR genes are the most rapidly evolving loci in vertebrates, and it is generally difficult to detect orthologues in different taxa. The unique exception is NKp30, an activating NKR in mammals that binds to the self-ligand B7H6. The NKp30-encoding gene, NCR3, has been found in most vertebrates including sharks, the oldest vertebrates with human-type adaptive immunity. NCR3 has a special, non-rearranging VJ-type immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) domain that predates the emergence of the rearranging antigen receptors. Herein we show that NCR3 loci are linked to the shark major histocompatibility complex (MHC), proving NCR3’s primordial association with the MHC. We identified eight subtypes of differentially expressed highly divergent shark NCR3 family genes. Using in situ hybridization, we detected one subtype, NS344823, to be expressed by predominantly single cells outside of splenic B cell zones. The expression by non-B cells was also confirmed by PCR in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Surprisingly, high expression of NS344823 was detected in the thymic cortex, demonstrating NS344823 expression in developing T cells. Finally, we show for the first time that shark T cells are found as single cells or in small clusters in the splenic red pulp, also unassociated with the large B cell follicles we previously identified.

"Three deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) given 104 TCID50 of mouse hepatitis virus -S intranasally all had significant serum neutralization titers to mouse hepatitis virus -S 3 weeks later. Ten other deer mice were given 103 TCID50 of mouse hepatitis virus -3 intranasally and placed with sentinel laboratory mice (CF1, C3H/Rv, and nu/nu) and uninoculated deer mice. One inoculated deer mouse died, but mouse hepatitis virus was not isolated. No other inoculated or uninoculated animals exhibited signs of disease. No sentinel animals exhibited serum neutralization titers for mouse hepatitis virus -3. Three of the remaining nine inoculated deer mice had positive antibody titers. It was concluded that deer mice do not develop clinical manifestations of mouse hepatitis virus or transmit the virus to potentially susceptible laboratory mice.

"We present a systematic comparison of three modules that enhance expression from retroviral gene transfer vectors at a posttranscriptional level: (i) splice signals (SS) that create an intron in the 5′ untranslated region; (ii) constitutive RNA transport elements (CTE), originally discovered in D-type retroviruses; and (iii) the posttranscriptional regulatory element of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WPRE). Here we show that enhancement of expression depends not only on the specific element, but also on the gene of interest, implying context-dependent activity of the RNA elements. Interestingly, different results were obtained for genes that normally require or do not require such control elements. Expression of the HIV-1 gag-protease gene, which normally depends on the viral export factor Rev, was strongly enhanced by an oligomeric CTE, while WPRE had only a marginal effect. On the other hand, both CTE and WPRE compensated for the lack of an intron in the expression of human β-globin. In this case, the strongest stimulation of RNA production was observed when functional SS were combined with the WPRE Both CTE and, in particular, WPRE also enhanced expression of cDNAs that do not normally require any such element (green fluorescent protein, human multidrug resistance-1). In this study, functional SS and WPRE acted in an additive manner, resulting in a 10-fold higher level of expression. Our results indicate that the described modules act on different levels of RNA processing, transport, and translation and that the correct choice of a posttranscriptional enhancer configuration depends on the type of cDNA to be expressed.

"Infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most commonly reported bloodborne infection in the United States. Individuals born between 1945-1965, the baby boomers, account for approximately 75% of all chronic HCV infections in the United States. The purpose of this study was to determine if a 6-week intervention, including outreach, education, and incentive, by a community-based health insurance company could improve uptake of HCV antibody screening among the 1945-1965 birth cohort. Individuals were eligible to participate in this campaign if they were born on or after January 1, 1945 and on or before December 31, 1965, had health insurance with Sendero Health Plans during the intervention period, and had no evidence of having received an HCV antibody test prior to the campaign start date. The 6-week campaign period was from November 14, 2018 through December 31, 2018. A gift card incentive was provided if HCV screening was completed on or before December 31, 2018. A total of 5287 individuals were eligible to participate in the campaign. Members who were baby boomers were 3.36 times more likely to receive HCV antibody screening during the intervention period in 2018 than during a similar period in 2017 (prevalence ratio = 3.36; P < 0.0001; 95% confidence interval: 2.71, 4.16). Health officials have established the identification, treatment, and elimination of HCV as a national policy objective. Using an outreach, education, and incentive approach, Sendero Health Plans improved uptake of HCV antibody screening among the high-risk baby boomer population.

"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants and children. Currently, palivizumab is the only approved monoclonal antibody (mAb) for prophylaxis of RSV. However, a small percentage of patients are not protected by palivizumab; in addition, palivizumab does not inhibit RSV replication effectively in the upper respiratory tract. We report here the development and characterization of motavizumab, an ultra-potent, affinity-matured, humanized mAb derived from palivizumab. Several palivizumab variants that enhanced the neutralization of RSV in vitro by up to 44-fold were generated; however, in vivo prophylaxis of cotton rats with these antibodies conferred only about a twofold improvement in potency over palivizumab. This unexpected small increase of in vivo potency was caused by poor serum pharmacokinetics and lung bio-availability that resulted from unexpectedly broad tissue binding. Subsequent analyses revealed that changes at three amino acids arising from the affinity maturation markedly increased the non-specific binding to various tissues. Our results suggested that kon-driven mutations are more likely to initiate non-specific binding events than koff-driven mutations. Reversion of these three residues to the original sequences greatly diminished the tissue binding. The resulting mAb, motavizumab, binds to RSV F protein 70-fold better than palivizumab, and exhibits about a 20-fold improvement in neutralization of RSV in vitro. In cotton rats, at equivalent concentrations, motavizumab reduced pulmonary RSV titers to up to 100-fold lower levels than did palivizumab and, unlike palivizumab, motavizumab very potently inhibited viral replication in the upper respiratory tract. This affinity-enhanced mAb is being investigated in pivotal clinical trials. Importantly, our engineering process offers precious insights into the improvement of other therapeutic mAbs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

"Despite intensive studies on sheep scrapie, a number of questions remain unanswered, such as the natural mode of transmission and the amount of infectivity which accumulates in edible tissues at different stages of scrapie infection. Studies using the mouse model proved to be useful for recognizing scrapie strain diversity, but the low sensitivity of mice to some natural scrapie isolates hampered further investigations. To investigate the sensitivity of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) to scrapie, we performed end-point titrations from two unrelated scrapie sources. Similar titres [105.5 ID50 U g-1 and 105.8 ID50 U g-1, both intracerebrally (i.c.)] were obtained, showing that voles can detect infectivity up to 3-4 orders of magnitude lower when compared with laboratory mice. We further investigated the relationships between PrPSc molecular characteristics, strain and prion titre in the brain and tonsil of the same scrapie-affected sheep. We found that protease-resistant PrPSc fragments (PrPres) from brain and tonsil had different molecular features, but induced identical disease phenotypes in voles. The infectivity titre of the tonsil estimated by incubation time assay was 104.8 i.c. ID50 U g-1, i.e. fivefold less than the brain. This compared well with the relative PrPres content, which was 8.8-fold less in tonsil than in brain. Our results suggest that brain and tonsil harboured the same prion strain showing different glycoprofiles in relation to the different cellular/tissue types in which it replicated, and that a PrPSc-based estimate of scrapie infectivity in sheep tissues could be achieved by combining sensitive PrPres detection methods and bioassay in voles. © 2008 Crown copyright.

"OBJECTIVES: In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic. High morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19 have been observed among older adults and widely reported in both mainstream and social media. The objective of this study was to analyze tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults, and to identify ageist content. DESIGN: We obtained a representative sample of original tweets containing the keywords “elderly,” “older,” and/or “boomer” plus the hashtags “#COVID19” and/or “#coronavirus.”. SETTING: Tweets posted between March 12 and March 21, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: We identified the type of user and number of followers for each account. Tweets were classified by three raters as (1) informative, (2) personal accounts, (3) personal opinions, (4) advice seeking, (5) jokes, and (6) miscellaneous. Potentially offensive content, as well as that downplaying the severity of COVID-19 because it mostly affects older adults, was identified. RESULTS: A total of 18,128 tweets were obtained, of which a random sample of 351 was analyzed. Most accounts (91.7%) belonged to individuals. The most common types of tweets were personal opinions (31.9%), followed by informative tweets (29.6%), jokes/ridicule (14.3%), and personal accounts (13.4%). Overall, 72 tweets (21.9%) likely intended to ridicule or offend someone and 21.1% had content implying that the life of older adults was less valuable or downplayed the relevance of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Most tweets related to COVID-19 and older adults contained personal opinions, personal accounts, and jokes. Almost one-quarter of analyzed tweets had ageist or potentially offensive content toward older adults. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:1661-1665, 2020.

"A new species of Mycoplasma, M. volis, was isolated from the respiratory tract of clinically normal field-trapped prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) that were to be housed in close proximity to other rodents. To determine the pathogenic potential of the new mycoplasmal isolate, three groups of rodents (Sprague Dawley rats, BALB/c mice, and severe combined immunodeficient [SCID] mice) were intranasally inoculated with 2 × 10 8 color-changing units (CCU) of M. volis and were observed for 4 to 6 weeks. Experimental animals did not manifest clinical signs of disease; however, one experimental SCID mouse was euthanized 5 days after inoculation because of a severe circling disorder. Lung lesions in experimental SD rats ranged from mild to severe bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) hyperplasia. Lung lesions in BALB/c and SCID mice ranged from no lesions to mild pneumonia. We were able to isolate M. volis from some control mice, none of which had lung lesions. All mice were seronegative for Sendai virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and M. pulmonis. All immunocompetent experimental animals (BALB/c mice and Sprague Dawley rats) were seropositive for M. volis. All immunocompetent control animals and SCID mice were seronegative for M. volis. Our data suggest that M. volis is capable of causing microscopic lesions and seroconversion in rats and mice, and therefore these rodents should not be housed in close proximity to voles.

"The genetic organization of hepadnaviruses is unusual in that all cis-acting regulatory sequences are located within genes. Thus, in the mammalian hepadnavirus genome, the presurface, surface, and X transcript promoters reside within the polymerase gene while the pregenome transcript promoter is located within the X gene. In this study we have identified two additional promoters within the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) X gene that stimulate production of transcripts in vitro. First, we cloned regions of the WHV X gene into a promoterless expression vector (pGL2) to examine their ability to promote expression of firefly luciferase and mapped a previously unidentified promoter to positions 1475-1625 of the WHV8 genome. Deletion analysis revealed that the essential domain of this promoter, termed the ORF5/ΔX transcript promoter, mapped to nucleotides 1525-1625. Analysis revealed that this transcript initiated at nucleotide 1572 in both human (HuH-7) and woodchuck (WLC-3) hepatoma cell lines. Consistent with this finding, DNA footprinting analysis revealed protection of nucleotides 1567-1578 on the positive strand of the WHV8 genome. The function of this transcript in vivo is unclear, however, it may be used to produce a truncated form of the X protein that initiates at an AUG codon at position 1743-1745 on the WHV8 genome. Next, a second promoter was identified at positions 1625-1975 that was responsible for production of an antisense transcript. The activity of this promoter was comparable to that of the previously characterized surface transcript promoter of WHV in the absence of an enhancer. The antisense transcript promoter resides immediately upstream of open reading frame (ORF) 6, a previously identified ORF on the strand opposite of the known WHV protein-encoding sequences, that is thought to represent a vestigial gene. Analysis indicates that the antisense transcript had multiple start sites: nucleotides 1683 and 1762 on the WHV8 genome when assayed in HuH-7 cells, and nucleotide 1786 when assayed in WLC-3 cells. These data are consistent with footprinting analysis of supercoiled WHV DNA that revealed that the regions encompassing nucleotides 1696-1685, 1781-1766, and 1801-1787 on the negative sense DNA strand were protected from nuclease degradation. It is possible that such a transcript was once used in protein expression in an ancestral virus and may now be used for genetic control of WHV replication and/or gene expression. Overall, these data are consistent with the presence of a bidirectional promoter complex within the WHV X gene. Copyright (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

"Australian antigen, the envelope protein of hepatitis B virus (HBV), was discovered in 1967 as a prevalent serum antigen in hepatitis B patients. Early electron microscopy (EM) studies showed that this antigen was present in 22-nm particles in patient sera, which were believed to be incomplete virus. Complete virus, much less abundant than the 22-nm particles, was finally visualized in 1970. HBV was soon found to infect chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbon apes, and, more recently, tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis). This restricted host range placed limits on the kinds of studies that might be performed to better understand the biology and molecular biology of HBV and to develop antiviral therapies to treat chronic infections. About 10 years after the discovery of HBV, this problem was bypassed with the discovery of viruses related to HBV in woodchucks, ground squirrels, and ducks. Although unlikely animal models, their use revealed the key steps in hepadnavirus replication and in the host response to infection, including the fact that the viral nuclear episome is the ultimate target for immune clearance of transient infections and antiviral therapy of chronic infections. Studies with these and other animal models have also suggested interesting clues into the link between chronic HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma.

"The recent discovery of novel alphacoronaviruses (alpha-CoVs) in European and Asian rodents revealed that rodent coronaviruses (CoVs) sampled worldwide formed a discrete phylogenetic group within this genus. To determine the evolutionary history of rodent CoVs in more detail, particularly the relative frequencies of virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission, we recovered longer fragments of CoV genomes from previously discovered European rodent alpha-CoVs using a combination of PCR and high-throughput sequencing. Accordingly, the full genome sequence was retrieved from the UK rat coronavirus, along with partial genome sequences from the UK field vole and Poland-resident bank vole CoVs, and a short conserved ORF1b fragment from the French rabbit CoV. Genome and phylogenetic analysis showed that despite their diverse geographic origins, all rodent alpha-CoVs formed a single monophyletic group and shared similar features, such as the same gene constellations, a recombinant beta-CoV spike gene, and similar core transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS). These data suggest that all rodent alpha CoVs sampled so far originate from a single common ancestor, and that there has likely been a long-term association between alpha CoVs and rodents. Despite this likely antiquity, the phylogenetic pattern of the alpha-CoVs was also suggestive of relatively frequent host-jumping among the different rodent species.

"Oncolytic virus therapy has recently been recognized as a promising new therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. In this study, we are proposing for the first time to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo oncolytic capacities of the Cowpox virus (CPXV). To improve the tumor selectivity and oncolytic activity, we developed a thymidine kinase (TK)-deleted CPXV expressing the suicide gene FCU1, which converts the non-toxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) into cytotoxic 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 5-fluorouridine-5′-monophosphate (5-FUMP). This TK-deleted virus replicated efficiently in human tumor cell lines; however, it was notably attenuated in normal primary cells, thus displaying a good therapeutic index. Furthermore, this new recombinant poxvirus rendered cells sensitive to 5-FC. In vivo, after systemic injection in mice, the TK-deleted variant caused significantly less mortality than the wild-type strain. A biodistribution study demonstrated high tumor selectivity and low accumulation in normal tissues. In human xenograft models of solid tumors, the recombinant CPXV also displayed high replication, inducing relevant tumor growth inhibition. This anti-tumor effect was improved by 5-FC co-administration. These results demonstrated that CPXV is a promising oncolytic vector capable of expressing functional therapeutic transgenes.

"Sin Nombre virus (SNV) causes hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in humans. Transmission of SNV among the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) host predominates during spring and summer, and is greater in peridomestic than sylvan settings where, protected from UV light, SNV may survive longer. Incidence of HCPS reflects these times and settings and is associated with inhalation of mouse excreta. Little is known, however, about how human use of outbuildings contributes to potential exposure to SNV. Here, the frequency and seasonality of outbuilding use by humans was evaluated, via a survey of rural residents in western Montana, to quantify human behaviors and potential risk of exposure to SNV. Retrieving or return of tools and scooping feed/grain were the most frequently undertaken activities. Seasonal activities coinciding with seasons of highest HCPS incidence and times of potentially high viral shedding by deer mice, included retrieving or returning tools, calving or lambing, and, to a lesser extent, feeding livestock and sweeping or cleaning. Human behavior is a component of SNV transmission risk and this preliminary study provides a basis from which to further evaluate this route of exposure. © 2010 International Association for Ecology and Health.

"A number of options are available to modify and improve DNA vaccines. An interesting approach to improve DNA vaccines is to fuse bioactive domains, like cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), to an antigen. Such fusion antigens are expressed in vivo and directed to immune cells by the specific bioactive domain and therefore possess great potential to induce and modulate antigen-specific immune responses. In the present study, we tested this new approach for immunomodulation against hepadnavirus infection in the woodchuck model. Plasmids expressing the nucleocapsid protein (WHcAg) and e antigen (WHeAg) of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) alone or in fusion to the extracellular domain of woodchuck CTLA-4 and CD28 were constructed. Immunizations of mice with plasmids expressing WHcAg or WHeAg led to a specific immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a)-dominant antibody response. In contrast, fusions of WHcAg to CTLA-4 and CD28 induced a specific antibody response with comparable levels of IgG1 and IgG2a. Furthermore, the specific IgG1 response to WHcAg/WHeAg developed immediately after a single immunization with the CTLA-4-WHcAg fusion. Woodchucks were immunized with plasmids expressing WHeAg or the CTLA-4-WHcAg fusion and subsequently challenged with WHV. CTLA-4-WHcAg showed an improved efficacy in induction of protective immune responses to WHV. In particular, the anti-WHsAg antibody response developed earlier after challenge in woodchucks that received immunizations with CTLA-4-WHcAg, consistent with the hypothesis that anti-WHs response is dependent on a Th cell response to WHcAg. In conclusion, the use of fusion genes represents a generally applicable strategy to improve DNA vaccination. Copyright © 2005, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

"Background: qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of miRNA-26a in pancreatic epithelial cells (HPDE) and human pancreatic cancer cell lines PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. Methods: PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines were infected with lentiviruses to construct PANC-miR-26a and MIA-miR-26a, and RT-PCR was used to detect the infection efficiency. The cell proliferation ability of PANC-miR-26a and MIA-miR-26a were examined by CCK-8 assay, and apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the expressions of CyclinE2 protein and mitochondria-associated apoptotic proteins. Results: miR-26a was expressed in human normal pancreatic epithelial cells (HPDE), and not detected in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2; miR-26a was highly expressed in the cell lines PANC-miR-26a and MIA-miR-26a infected by the virus particles. The absorbance values of PANC-miR-26a and MIA-miR-26a were lower than those of NC1 and PANC-1 in control group. The apoptosis rates of PANC-miR-26a and MIA-miR-26a were substantially higher than those of the control group. The overexpression of miR-26a inhibited the expression of the target protein CyclinE2 in PANC-miR-26a and MIA-miR-26a. The expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 was decreased in PANC-miR-26a and MIA-miR-26a, while the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax was increased. Compared with HPDE, miR-26a was down-regulated in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2. After overexpression of miR-26a, the proliferation of PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines was weakened. Conclusion: Molecular mechanism is the negative regulation of CyclinE2 by miR-26a as well as the expressions of downstream mitochondrial apoptosis proteins Bcl-2 and Bax.

"Three discrete activities of the paramyxovirus hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, receptor binding, receptor cleaving (neuraminidase), and triggering of the fusion protein, each affect the promotion of viral fusion and entry. For human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), the effects of specific mutations that alter these functions of the receptor-binding protein have been well characterized using cultured monolayer cells, which have identified steps that are potentially relevant to pathogenesis. In the present study, proposed mechanisms that are relevant to pathogenesis were tested in natural host cell cultures, a model of the human airway epithelium (HAE) in which primary HAE cells are cultured at an air-liquid interface and retain functional properties. Infection of HAE cells with wild-type HPIV3 and variant viruses closely reflects that seen in an animal model, the cotton rat, suggesting that HAE cells provide an ideal system for assessing the interplay of host cell and viral factors in pathogenesis and for screening for inhibitory molecules that would be effective in vivo. Both HN's receptor avidity and the function and timing of F activation by HN require a critical balance for the establishment of ongoing infection in the HAE, and these HN functions independently modulate the production of active virions. Alterations in HN's F-triggering function lead to the release of noninfectious viral particles and a failure of the virus to spread. The finding that the dysregulation of F triggering prohibits successful infection in HAE cells suggests that antiviral strategies targeted to HN's F-triggering activity may have promise in vivo.

"The long-tailed pygmy rice rat Oligoryzomys longicaudatus (Rodentia, Cricetidae) experiences marked population density fluctuations. This species is the major reservoir of the Andes orthohantavirus associated with the hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in southern Argentina, and information on dispersal patterns at different population densities, or differences in dispersal between the sexes during those periods, could contribute to understanding risk of viral transmission among individuals. We examined the spatial genetic structure of O. longicaudatus at a local scale to elucidate how variation in population density influences dispersal patterns. Effective dispersal levels were estimated through spatial genetic autocorrelation (SGA) analyses in periods of different density, and for females and males separately, within an area of 510 × 180 m, using seven microsatellite loci. In autumn (high-intermediate and intermediate densities), SGA was primarily determined by females, which show philopatric behavior in defense of their nests and newborns. In summer (low density), neither sex showed SGA, which could be due to spacing behavior combined with high recruitment rates among adjacent environments. At high-intermediate densities, females remained close to each other, contracting their home ranges. These established individuals would ""fence"" the area, preventing the immigration of individuals from proximate areas, until population density declines again. We detected differential patterns of effective dispersal for both sexes in different stages of the annual and inter-annual population phases of O. longicaudatus. Since high levels of gene flow were reported for both sexes in summer and for males in all analyzed seasons, the transmission risk of diseases such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome would be high at a local scale.

"Introduction: The black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis (I scapularis), is now recognized as the deadliest tick vector in the United States. The Upper Midwest, particularly Wisconsin and Minnesota, are endemic to a diversity of tick-transmitted infectious diseases. Although Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, still accounts for the majority of diagnosed infections, I scapularis is known to transmit other bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents. Objective: To provide an overview of the array of pathogenic microorganisms carried by I scapu-laris ticks in the Upper Midwest. Methods: A literature review was conducted to collect and analyze current information about I scapularis lifestyle, transmission, microorganisms carried by the arthropod vector, and the diseases that occur as a result of infections with these microorganisms in the Upper Midwest. Results: Diagnosis of co-infection from tick-borne zoonosis in humans has increased over the last 2 decades. Since I scapularis can transmit multiple pathogens, it is clinically important because different diagnostic testing and treatment strategies may need to be implemented for a patient with I scapularis-borne infection(s). Conclusions: This review has concentrated on I scapularis-transmitted diseases affecting the Upper Midwest and has explored the ecology of the I scapularis vector and its role in pathogen transmission.

"The safety of the SAG2 virus, a low virulence mutant of the SAD strain, was investigated in ten species of mammals and seven species of birds liable to consume vaccine baits. These species are the western hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus), the meadow vole (Microtus arvalis), the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus), the water vole (Arvicola terrestris), the field mouse (Apodemus flavicollis or A. sylvaticus), the Norway rat; (Rattus norvegicus), the european badger (Meles meles), the domestic ferret (Mustela putorius furo), the wild boar (Sus scrofa), the domestic goat (Capra hircus), the carrion crow (Corvus corone), the rook (Corvus frugilegus), the buzzard (Buteo buteo), the red kite (Milvus milvus), the tawny owl (Strix aluco), the long-eared owl (Asio otus) and the barn owl (Tyto alba). The vaccine was administered orally to each species, by an intramuscular (i.m.) route to the rodents and ferret, and by an intracerebral route to the field mouse. No pathogenicity was observed in the 169 animals vaccinated throughout an observation period of over 30 days. After euthanasia, no rabies virus could be detected either in the brain or in the salivary glands of any of the animals. The SAG2 virus administered orally, triggered a specific seroconversion in the field mouse, wild boar, ferret and most of the raptors. Following administration by the i.m. route, specific antibody titres were observed in most of the rodents, as well as in the ferrets.

"Peru is a centre of origin and domestication of the potato, pepper and tomato (family Solanaceae). Many potyviruses (genus Potyvirus) that infect these crops were described 20-30 years ago. However, definitive classification of these viruses as distinct species remains unresolved for several reasons, including their close serological relationships, similar symptomatology in test plants and lack of genomic sequence data. Using samples collected from Peru, we have determined the complete genomic sequence of two strains of Peru tomato virus (PTV) as well as near-complete sequences for two additional PTV strains. We also obtained partial sequences of four strains of Potato virus V(PVV). Comparisons with genomic sequences of Wildpotato mosaic virus (WPMV), Potato virus Y(PVY), Pepper mottle virus (PepMoV), Potato virus A (PVA) and other potyviruses established that all these viruses constitute different taxa (species). Phylogenetic comparisons indicated that PTV, PVV and WPMV are the most closely related species which, together with PepMoV, PVY, Pepper yellow mosaic virus and Pepper severe mosaic virus, constitute a group that is distinguishable from other potyviruses. Therefore, the members of this group may share a common ancestor. PVA does not belong to this group. PVV and PTV were also closely related serologically. However, PTV did not cross-protect against PVV and WPMV in tobacco plants or complement systemic infection of PVV and WPMV in pepper plants. Two biologically and phylogenetically distinguishable strain groups were identified within PTV and PVV. In future studies, the sequence data and virus-specific primers and probes for PTV, PVV and WPMV described in this study will enable accurate indexing of plants with respect to either single or mixed infection with these viruses.

"Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS), a rodent-borne zoonosis, has been endemic in the Americas for at least several decades. It is hypothesized that the 1991-1992 El Nino-southern oscillation (ENSO) caused increased precipitation that allowed an increase in rodent population densities, thereby increasing the possibility of transmission to humans. The result was a 1993-1994 outbreak of the disease in the Four Corners states of the southwestern United States. A second strong ENSO occurred in 1997-1998, after a period of considerable public education about the risks of hantavirus infection that began during the 1993-1994 outbreak. The caseload of HCPS increased 5-fold above baseline in the Four Corners states in 1998-1999. Regions that had received increased rainfall in 1998 were especially affected. A large majority of the 1998-1999 case patients reported indoor exposure to deer mice. Hantavirus outbreaks can occur in response to abiotic events, even in the face of extensive public education and awareness.

"The woodchuck is one of the only lab animal models of chronic viral hepatitis infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Using this model, changes in tissue energetics in the liver due to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma can be monitored by repeated magnetic resonance imaging and localized phosphorus spectroscopy. Age- and sex-matched control (n=5) and chronically infected (n=5) adult woodchucks were imaged four times in a six-month period in a 7-T horizontal-bore magnet. Using a custom-built doubly tunable quadrature volume coil, sagittal and axial FLASH images (128×128, slice thickness = 5 mm, TR/TE=1000/4.1, 8 averages) were acquired to locate the largest portion of the liver with the least amount of signal contamination from surrounding abdominal muscle. Two-dimensional 31P chemical-shift imaging (2D-CSI) was acquired (16×16 data matrix, 24×24×2 cm 3, 1024 data points, 16 averages) for all animals. The extent of liver injury was determined using serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT). The livers of infected woodchucks showed a significant increase (p=0.01) in phosphomonoesters (PME):β-adenosine triphosphate (NTP). Chronically infected woodchucks had higher levels of serum GGT compared to uninfected woodchucks (p=0.002). An increase in the PME:β-NTP ratio indicates cellular proliferation within the malignant tumor. © ESMRMB 2005.

"Anecdotal data gathered from many populations suggest that southern flying squirrel (SFS, Glaucomys volans) use of the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker's (RCW, Picoides borealis) nest and roost cavities may negatively affect RCW populations. We conducted a controlled experiment to determine the effects of SFSs on RCW reproductive success. During the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons, SFSs were removed from 30 RCW clusters and 32 clusters served as controls. SFSs were the most frequently encountered occupants of RCW cavities and used 20-33% of RCW cavities in control and treatment clusters over both years. Treatment groups produced significantly more successful nests (≥ 1 fledgling) than control groups in 1994. In 1995 however, there was no difference in the number of successful nests. In both years, RCW groups nesting in treatment clusters produced significantly more fledglings than groups in control clusters in each of four experimental areas, averaging approximately 0.7 additional fledglings per nesting group. Loss of entire clutches or broods, possibly as a result of predation or abandonment, was a major factor limiting reproduction in control groups in 1994. In contrast, differences in partial brood loss appeared to be the cause of differential fledging success in 1995 Usurpation of RCW roost cavities by SFSs may have placed greater energetic demands on RCWs for cavity defence or thermoregulation, thus reducing energy available for reproduction. Our results show that SFS use of RCW cavities during the breeding season has a significant impact on RCWs and that management of RCW populations should include activities that either minimize SFS populations in RCW clusters or limit access of SFSs to RCW cavities.

"A model for studying effectors of immunity to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was developed. Pairs of inbred cotton rats Sigmodon hispidus were joined surgically using the technique of parabiosis. One week later, one animal of each pair was primed intranasally with small volume of RSV suspension. Fourteen days after priming, both animals of each pair were bled for determination of serum neutralizing antibody titers, and challenged intranasally with standard dose of RSV suspension. Single, unprimed cotton rats were challenged concomitantly and served as controls. Four days after challenge, all animals were sacrificed for virus titration of nasal tissues and lungs. Parabiosed cotton rats were surgically separated at varying intervals between priming and challenge (days 7, 9, 12, or 14 after priming) or were kept joined until sacrificed (day 18). Significant transfer of nasal and pulmonary immunity from primed to unprimed parabionts began 9 days after priming, gradually increasing through 18 days. Resistance to RSV challenge in spite of low levels of serum neutralizing antibody suggests that non‐antibody immunologic mediators were responsible for the transferred immunity. Evidence is presented for three broad categories of RSV immunologic effectors: systemic, local with transient systemic phase, and local without systemic phase. These categories are now amenable to further study using the described model. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company

"Southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans; SFS) nest in naturally formed cavities in snags and hardwoods found in mature, oak (Quercus spp.)–hickory (Carya spp.) forests. Intensive forest fragmentation of the Midwest United States limits the number of available nesting trees. We quantified annual nest-site selection patterns by southern flying squirrels across fragmented landscapes of west-central Illinois, USA. We used radiotelemetry to measure nest-tree use by 55 SFS (30 males, 25 females) captured during 2014–2016. Of 105 nest trees used by SFS, live trees and snags comprised 75% and 25%, respectively. Probability of diurnal nest-tree use increased 1.08/1.00-cm increase in diameter-breast-height and by 1.50/1-unit increase in the number of overstory mast trees between random and nest-tree habitat areas (i.e., 300-m2 circular plots). Similarly, probability of diurnal nest-tree use increased 1.29/1-unit increase in the number of snags between random and nest-tree habitat areas. Our results revealed no intersexual differences in patterns of nest-site selection, which may reflect the tendency for SFS to compensate for reduced availability of key structural attributes (i.e., snags, overstory trees) across fragmented forests by exhibiting similar intersexual patterns of nest-tree use. Use of natural cavities for denning is encouraging, but also underscores the importance of unharvested oak–hickory forests in contributing essential habitat to SFS populations in fragmented Midwestern landscapes. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.

"Ixodes ricinus (Acari: Ixodidae) L. transmit a wide variety of pathogens to vertebrates including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Understanding of the epidemiology of tick-borne infections requires basic knowledge of the regional and local factors influencing tick population dynamics. The present study describes the results of monitoring of a questing I. ricinus population, conducted over 35years (1977-2011) in the eastern, poorly studied part of its range (Russia, Tula region). We have found that the multiannual average abundance of ticks is small and varies depending on the biotope and degree of urban transformation. Tick abundance for the first 14years of observations (1977-1990) was at the lower limit of the sensitivity of our methods throughout the study area (0.1-0.9 specimens per 1-km transect). In the following 21years (1991-2011), a manifold increase in abundance was observed, which reached 18.1±1.8 individuals per 1-km transect in moist floodplain terraces, and 4.8±0.9 in xerophylic hill woods. Long-term growth of tick abundance occurred in spite of a relatively constant abundance of small mammals and only minor fluctuations in the abundance of large wild animals. Climate and anthropogenic changes appear to be the main contributors to increased abundance of the tick.

"Arginine vasopressin and its V1a receptor subtype (V1aR) are critical for pair bond formation between adult prairie voles. However, it is unclear which brain circuits are involved in this vasopressin-mediated facilitation of pair bond formation. Here, we examined mating-induced Fos expression in several brain regions involved in sociosexual and reward circuitry in male prairie voles. Consistent with studies in other species, Fos expression was induced in several regions known to be involved in sociosexual behavior, namely, the medial amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and medial preoptic area. Fos induction also occurred in limbic and reward regions, including the ventral pallidum, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus (MDthal). Next, we infused a selective V1aR antagonist into three candidate brain regions that seemed most likely involved in vasopressin-mediated pair bond formation: the ventral pallidum, medial amygdala, and MDthal. Blockade of V1aR in the ventral pallidum, but not in the medial amygdala or MDthal, prevented partner preference formation. Lastly, we demonstrated that the mating-induced Fos activation in the ventral pallidum was vasopressin-dependent, since over-expression of V1aR using viral vector gene transfer resulted in a proportionate increase in mating-induced Fos in the same region. This is the first study to show that vasopressin neurotransmission occurs in the ventral pallidum during mating, and that V1aR activation in this region is necessary for pair bond formation in male prairie voles. The results from this study have profound implications for the neural circuitry underlying social attachment and generate novel hypotheses regarding the neural control of social behavior. © 2004 IBRO.

"Adenovirus is an emerging threat to red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris conservation, but confirming clinically significant adenovirus infections in red squirrels is challenging. Rapid intestinal autolysis after death in wild animals frequently obscures pathology characteristic of the disease in animals found dead. We review the available literature to determine current understanding of both subclinical and clinically significant adenovirus infections in free-living wild and captive red squirrel populations. Benefits of scientific testing for adenovirus incorporating both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technologies are compared and contrasted. We favour viral particle detection using TEM in animals exhibiting enteropathy at post-mortem and the use of PCR to detect subclinical cases where no enteric abnormalities are observed. Adenoviral infections associated with re-introduction studies are evaluated by examination of sporadic cases in wild populations and of data from captive collections used to service such studies. The paucity of data available on adenovirus infection in grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis populations is documented, and we highlight that although subclinical virus presence is recorded in several locations in Great Britain and in Italy, no clinically significant disease cases have been detected in the species thus far. Current speculation about potential interspecific infection between sciurids and other woodland rodents such as wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus is examined. Where subclinical adenovirus presence has been detected in sympatric populations using the same point food sources, husbandry methods may be used to diminish the potential for cross-infection. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling disease in red squirrel populations by using clearly defined scientific methods. In addition, we propose hypothetical conservation benefits of restricting contact rates between red squirrels and sympatric grey squirrels and of limiting competition from other woodland rodent species.

"Studies on the common vole Microtus arvalis revealed a distinct cytogenetic response to the influence of ionizing radiation, a wide range of variation in the group average indices of chromosome instability beyond the zone of technogenic impact, and the influence of natural factors (viral infections and fluctuations of population size) on the frequency of chromosome aberrations. In the northern mole vole Ellobius talpinus, neither the mutagenic effect of ionizing radiation nor interpopulation differences in the level of chromosome aberrations in the absence of anthropogenic impact were detected. Variation of genome instability of the rodents is significantly contributed to by species demography and population cycles.

"Oxytocin receptors in the nucleus accumbens have been implicated in the regulation of alloparental behavior and pair bond formation in the socially monogamous prairie vole. Oxytocin receptor density in the nucleus accumbens is positively correlated with alloparenting in juvenile and adult female prairie voles, and oxytocin receptor antagonist infused into the nucleus accumbens blocks this behavior. Furthermore, prairie voles have higher densities of oxytocin receptors in the accumbens than nonmonogamous rodent species, and blocking accumbal oxytocin receptors prevents mating-induced partner preference formation. Here we used adeno-associated viral vector gene transfer to examine the functional relationship between accumbal oxytocin receptor density and social behavior in prairie and meadow voles. Adult female prairie voles that overexpress oxytocin receptor in the nucleus accumbens displayed accelerated partner preference formation after cohabitation with a male, but did not display enhanced alloparental behavior. However, partner preference was not facilitated in nonmonogamous meadow voles by introducing oxytocin receptor into the nucleus accumbens. These data confirm a role for oxytocin receptor in the accumbens in the regulation of partner preferences in female prairie voles, and suggest that oxytocin receptor expression in the accumbens is not sufficient to promote partner preferences in nonmonogamous species. These data are the first to demonstrate a direct relationship between oxytocin receptor density in the nucleus accumbens and variation in social attachment behaviors. Thus, individual variation in oxytocin receptor expression in the striatum may contribute to natural diversity in social behaviors. Copyright © 2009 Society for Neuroscience.

"Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and Streptococcus pneumoniae are important causative agents of respiratory tract infections. Both pathogens are associated with seasonal disease outbreaks in the pediatric population, and can often be detected simultaneously in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis or pneumonia. It has been described that respiratory virus infections may predispose for bacterial superinfections, resulting in severe disease. However, studies on the influence of bacterial colonization of the upper respiratory tract on the pathogenesis of subsequent respiratory virus infections are scarce. Here, we have investigated whether pneumococcal colonization enhances subsequent HRSV infection. We used a newly generated recombinant subgroup B HRSV strain that expresses enhanced green fluorescent protein and pneumococcal isolates obtained from healthy children in disease-relevant in vitro and in vivo model systems. Three pneumococcal strains specifically enhanced in vitro HRSV infection of primary well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface, whereas two other strains did not. Since previous studies reported that bacterial neuraminidase enhanced HRSV infection in vitro, we measured pneumococcal neuraminidase activity in these cultures but found no correlation with the observed infection enhancement in our model. Subsequently, a selection of pneumococcal strains was used to induce nasal colonization of cotton rats, the best available small animal model for HRSV. Intranasal HRSV infection three days later resulted in strain-specific enhancement of HRSV replication in vivo. One S. pneumoniae strain enhanced HRSV both in vitro and in vivo, and was also associated with enhanced syncytium formation in vivo. However, neither pneumococci nor HRSV were found to spread from the upper to the lower respiratory tract, and neither pathogen was transmitted to naive cage mates by direct contact. These results demonstrate that pneumococcal colonization can enhance subsequent HRSV infection, and provide tools for additional mechanistic and intervention studies.

"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the only infectious disease for which a monoclonal antibody (MAb) is used in humans. Palivizumab (PZ) is a humanized murine MAb to the F protein of RSV. PZ-resistant viruses appear after in vitro and in vivo growth of RSV in the presence of PZ. Fitness for replication could be a determinant of the likelihood of dissemination of resistant viruses. We assessed the fitness of two PZ-resistant viruses (F212 and MP4). F212 grew less well in cell culture than the parent A2 virus and was predicted to be less fit than A2. Equal amounts of F212 and A2 were mixed and passaged in cell culture. F212 disappeared from the viral population, indicating it was less fit than the A2 virus. The MP4 virus grew as well as A2 in culture and in cotton rats. A2/MP4 virus input ratios of 1:1, 10:1, 100:1, and 1,000:1 were compared in competitive replication. For all input ratios except 1,000:1, the MP4 virus became dominant, supplanting the A2 virus. The MP4 virus also dominated the A2 virus during growth in cotton rats. Thus, the mutant MP4 virus was more fit than A2 virus in both in vitro and in vivo competitive replication. Whether this fitness difference was due to the identified nucleotide substitutions in the F gene or to mutations elsewhere in the genome is unknown. Understanding the mechanisms by which mutant virus fitness increased or decreased could prove useful for consideration in attenuated vaccine design efforts.

"The development of vectors that express a therapeutic transgene efficiently and specifically in hematopoietic cells (HCs) is an important goal for gene therapy of hematological disorders. We have previously shown that a 500-bp fragment from the proximal Was gene promoter in a lentiviral vector (LV) was sufficient to achieve more than 100-fold higher levels of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein in HCs than in nonhematopoietic cells (non-HCs). We show now that this differential was reduced up to 10 times when the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene (eGFP) was expressed instead of Was in the same LV backbone. Insertion of Was cDNA sequences downstream of eGFP in these LVs had a negative effect on transgene expression. This effect varied in different cell types but, overall, Was cDNA sequences increased the hematopoietic specificity of Was promoter-driven LV. We have characterized the minimal fragment required to increase hematopoietic specificity and have demonstrated that the mechanism involves Was promoter regulation and RNA processing. In addition, we have shown that Was cDNA sequences interfere with the enhancer activity of the woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element. These results represent the first data showing the role of Was intragenic sequences in gene regulation. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

"PR0806-80 (Reg. No. GP-296, PI 672994) and PR0806-81 (Reg. No. GP-297, PI 672995) are multiple disease-resistant dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) germplasm lines adapted to the humid tropics, developed and released cooperatively by the University of Puerto Rico Agricultural Experiment Station, the USDA–ARS, the Escuela Agrícola Panamericana (Zamorano), the Instituto Dominicano de Investigaciones Agropecuarias y Forestales, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development of the Republic of Haiti. The breeding objective was to develop white dry bean lines that combine resistance to Bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), Bean common mosaic necrotic virus (BCMNV), Bean golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV), and rust, caused by Uromyces appendiculatus (Pers.) Unger. PR0806-80 and PR0806-81 were developed by pedigree selection to the F<inf>6</inf> generation on the basis of superior agronomic traits, disease resistance, and commercial seed type. Advanced generation lines were screened for rust resistance in Honduras and were resistant to BGYMV, BCMNV, and rust in trials planted in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti. Results from greenhouse inoculations suggest that the lines combine the Ur-4, Ur-5, and Ur-11 alleles of rust resistance genes. Greenhouse inoculations were used to detect the presence of the bc-3 gene for resistance to BCMV and BCMNV, and marker-assisted selection was used to identify the presence of the bgm-1 allele and the SW12 quantitative trait locus for BGYMV resistance. The presence of SA14 and SI19 sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers provided further evidence that these lines have the rust resistance genes Ur-4 and Ur-5. The lines were evaluated in field trials in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Puerto Rico. Mean seed yields of PR0806-80 (2048 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and PR0806-81 (2091 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were comparable to the check cultivar ‘Verano’ (2251 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>). These multiple disease-resistant white lines should be useful as parents to enhance the virus and rust resistance of white, small red, and black beans.

"Total RNA from normal adult woodchucks was analyzed using membrane arrays containing human cDNA clones, and the gene expression patterns were compared to human liver. Various hybridization and wash conditions were examined. In both the woodchuck and human livers, 352 genes were identified as highly expressed (Z-scores ≥1.96). These genes represented numerous liver functions: transcription, RNA processing, signal transduction, protein synthesis and degradation, as well as enzymes. Several genes were selected and expression was verified by Northern blots for woodchuck liver. There were no false positives but 29 genes were identified as false negatives, expressed only in human liver. Possible reasons for these false negatives were the length and percentage of homology between the two species, differences in the distribution and types of mismatches, and the sequence region spotted on the array. These were assessed by examining expression of the transferrin gene in both species. A 200-fold range of RNA concentration (0.1-20 μg total RNA) was also examined and the optimal RNA concentration was determined to be 5 μg. Membranes were capable of being hybridized and reprobed at least five times. The study demonstrates that cross-species hybridization is a valid method for identifying gene expression in woodchuck liver. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

"Viruses often contain cis-acting RNA elements, which facilitate the posttranscriptional processing and export of their messages. These elements fall into two classes distinguished by the presence of either viral or cellular RNA binding proteins. To date, studies have indicated that the viral proteins utilize the CRM1dependent export pathway, while the cellular factors generally function in a CRM1-independent manner. The cis-acting element found in the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) (the WHV posttranscriptional regulatory element [WPRE]) has the ability to posttranscriptionally stimulate transgene expression and requires no viral proteins to function. Conventional wisdom suggests that the WPRE would function in a CRM1-independent manner. However, our studies on this element reveal that its efficient function is sensitive to the overexpression of the C terminus of CAN/Nup214 and treatment with the antimicrobial agent leptomycin B. Furthermore, the overexpression of CRM1 stimulates WPRE activity. These results suggest a direct role for CRM1 in the export function of the WPRE. This observation suggests that the WPRE is directing messages into a CRM1-dependent mRNA export pathway in somatic mammalian cells.

"Although the oncolytic parvovirus H-1PV has entered clinical trials, predicting therapeutic success remains challenging. We investigated whether the antiviral state in tumor cells determines the parvoviral oncolytic efficacy. The interferon/interferon-stimulated genes (IFN/ISG)-circuit and its major configurator, human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), were evaluated using qRT-PCR, ELISA, Western blot, and RNA-Seq techniques. In pancreatic cancer cell lines, H-1PV caused a late global shutdown of innate immunity, whereby the concomitant inhibition of HERVs and IFN/ISGs was co-regulatory rather than causative. The growth-inhibitory IC50 doses correlated with the power of suppression but not with absolute ISG levels. Moreover, H-1PV was not sensitive to exogenous IFN despite upregulated antiviral ISGs. Such resistance questioned the biological necessity of the oncotropic ISG-shutdown, which instead might represent a surrogate marker for personalized oncolytic efficacy. The disabled antiviral homeostasis may modify the activity of other viruses, as demonstrated by the reemergence of endogenous AluY-retrotransposons. This way of suppression may compromise the interferogenicity of drugs having gemcitabine-like mechanisms of action. This shortcoming in immunogenic cell death induction is however amendable by immune cells which release IFN in response to H-1PV.

"Cultural properties and the capacity for persistence were studied in spontaneous erythromycin-resistant (E er(r)S(M)), in induced erythromycin-resistant (E er(r)I) mutants and in a virulent revertant (E Vir) of the vaccine strain E, as compared with parent vaccine strain E and standard virulent strain Breinl of Rickettsia prowazekii. Cultural properties of the strains were found to differ in passages in chick embryos (CE) and cultures of FL cells. Multiplication indices in CE of mutant E er(r)I were significantly lower than those of other strains (E, E er(r)S(M), E Vir, Breinl). The multiplication rate in FL cells was found to be high in strains E er(r)S(M), Breinl, E Vir, being much lower in strains E er(r)I and E. The capacity of the virulent revertant E Vir to persist in cotton rat (CR) was higher as compared with that of standard strain Breinl and significantly higher than that of the parent stain E. Low level carrier state of rickettsia was registered in CR infected with the mutant E er(r)I.

"Hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver disease and resulting complications are predicted to increase in the coming decades. However, recent availability of interferon-free treatment has put the spotlight on this epidemic and its health and economic impacts. Yet the cost of therapy is frequently prohibitive. When available, treatment provides an opportunity to abort disease progression, thus forgoing expensive downstream healthcare expenditures. Cost savings from therapy seem both probable and measurable in select patients with advanced disease and low risk of reinfection. The economic argument for early treatment is not as clear in those with less advanced liver disease and higher risk of reinfection. The optimal alignment of the relevant clinical and epidemiologic variables has yet to be clearly defined.

"RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionary conserved cellular process for the regulation of gene expression. In mammalian cells, RNAi is induced via short (21-23nt) duplexes of RNA, termed small interfering RNA (siRNA), that can elicit highly sequence-specific gene silencing. However, synthetic siRNA duplexes are polyanionic macromolecules that do not readily enter cells and typically require the use of a delivery vector for effective gene silencing in vitro and in vivo. Choice of delivery system is usually made on its ability to enhance cellular uptake of siRNA. However, recent gene expression profiling (toxicogenomics) studies have shown that separate from their effects on cellular uptake, delivery systems can also elicit wide ranging gene changes in target cells that may impact on the 'off-target' effects of siRNA. Furthermore, if delivery systems also alter the expression of genes targeted for silencing, then siRNA activity may be compromised or enhanced depending on whether the target gene is up-regulated or down-regulated respectively. Citing recent examples from the literature, this article therefore reviews the toxicogenomics of non-viral delivery systems and highlights the importance of understanding the genomic signature of siRNA delivery reagents in terms of their impact on gene silencing activity and specificity. Such information will be essential in the selection of optimally acting siRNA-delivery system combinations for the many applications of RNA interference. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

"Recombinant adenoviruses are employed widely for vascular gene transfer. Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are a relatively poor target for transgene expression after adenovirus-mediated gene delivery, however, even when expression is regulated by powerful, constitutive viral promoters. The major immediate-early murine cytomegalovirus enhancer/promoter (MIEmCMV) elicits substantially greater transgene expression than the human cytomegalovirus promoter (MIEhCMV) in all cell types in which they have been compared. The Woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element (WPRE) increases transgene expression in numerous cell lines, and fragments of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC) promoter increase expression within SMC from heterologous promoters. We therefore, compared the expression of β-galactosidase after adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of lacZ under the transcriptional regulation of a variety of combinations of the promoters and enhancers described, in vitro and in porcine coronary arteries. We demonstrate that inclusion of WPRE and a fragment of the rabbit SMMHC promoter along with MIEmCMV increases β-galactosidase expression 90-fold in SMC in vitro and ≈40-fold in coronary arteries, compared with vectors in which expression is regulated by MIEhCMV alone. Expression cassette modification represents a simple method of improving adenovirus-mediated vascular gene transfer efficiency and has important implications for the development of efficient cardiovascular gene therapy strategies.

"Cytokine and antiangiogenic gene therapies have proved effective in implanted hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models in which small tumor burdens were established in small rodents. These models, however, may not reflect human HCCs, which are frequently detected at a stage when tumors are large and multifocal. In addition, HCC in patients is often associated with viral hepatitis. To investigate the effectiveness of a mixture type of gene therapy strategy on large tumor burdens, we used the woodchuck model in which woodchuck hepatitis virus-induced HCCs are large and multifocal, simulating the conditions in humans. Adenoviruses encoding antiangiogenic factors (pigment epithelium-derived factor and endostatin) or cytokines (GM-CSF and IL-12) were delivered via the hepatic artery separately or in combination into woodchuck livers bearing HCCs. Our results showed that the mixture type of strategy, which contained two cytokines and two antiangiogenic factors, had better antitumor effects on large tumors as compared with monotherapy either with antiangiogenic or cytokine genes. The immunotherapy recruited significant levels of CD3 + T cells that infiltrated the tumors, whereas the antiangiogenesis-based therapy significantly reduced tumor vasculature. The mixture type of gene therapy achieved both effects. In addition, it induced high levels of natural killer cells and apoptotic cells and reduced the levels of immunosuppressive effectors in the tumor regions. Hence, antiangiogenic therapy may provide the advantage of reducing immune tolerance in large tumors, making them more vulnerable to the immune reactions. Our study implies that in the future, the combination therapy may prove effective for the treatment of patients with advanced HCC.

"OBJECTIVES: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is typically asymptomatic until severe liver disease occurs and even then can remain undiagnosed for some time; thus, screening and treatment of asymptomatic persons are needed to prevent poor outcomes. In a previous analysis of data from between 2006 and 2011, we found that 17% of newly diagnosed HCV infections in 4 large health systems were among persons with cirrhosis and/or end-stage liver disease, termed “late diagnosis.” We sought to determine the proportion with late diagnosis during 2014-2016, after release of CDC baby boomer (1945-1965 birth cohort) testing guidelines in 2012. STUDY DESIGN: The cohort was based on analysis of electronic health records and administrative data of about 2.7 million patients visiting the same healthcare systems during 2014-2016. METHODS: Among persons with newly diagnosed chronic HCV infection during 2014-2016, we analyzed data collected up to January 1, 2017. RESULTS: Among 2695 patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection, 576 (21.4%) had late diagnosis. Most were born between 1945 and 1965 (n = 1613 [59.9%]), and among these, 27.6% had late diagnosis. Patients with versus without late diagnosis had equally lengthy prediagnosis observation in the health systems (mean and median, 9.1 and 9.1 vs 8.3 and 7.8 years, respectively) but were more likely to have a postdiagnosis hospitalization (32.5% vs 12.5%; P <.001) with greater number of hospital days (358.8 vs 78.5 per 100 person-years; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: More than one-fifth of patients with newly diagnosed HCV infection during 2014-2016—and more than a quarter of those born between 1945 and 1965—had late diagnosis despite many years of in-system care, an increase of 5 percentage points since 2006-2011, after the interim initiation of age-based screening recommendations. Our data highlight missed opportunities for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention before the onset of severe liver disease, which is associated with high cost and diminished outcomes.

"The urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are important models for developing gene replacement therapy for liver diseases. Long-term correction of the most common UCD, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, has yet to be achieved in clinical or preclinical settings. The single human clinical trial using early-generation adenovirus (Ad) failed to show any biochemical correction. In adult OTC-deficient mice, an E1/E2-deleted Ad vector expressing the mouse OTC gene, but not the human, was only transiently therapeutic. By using post-transcriptional overexpression in the context of the less immunogenic helper-dependent adenoviral vector, we achieved metabolic correction of adult OTC-deficient mice for >6 months. Demonstrating this result were normalized orotic aciduria, normal hepatic enzyme activity, and elevated OTC RNA and protein levels in the absence of chronic hepatotoxicity. Overexpressing the human protein may have overcome two potential mechanisms accounting for poor cross-species complementation: a kinetic block at the level of mitochondrial import or a dominant negative effect by the mutant polypeptide. These data represent an important approach for treating human inborn errors of hepatocyte metabolism like the UCDs that require high-level transduction and gene expression for clinical correction. © 2004 The American Society of Gene Therapy.
